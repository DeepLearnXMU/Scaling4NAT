Gutach: even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters apart: On Tuesday the new B 33-pedestrian lamlight was opened in Gutach at the village's car park - within the sight of the older town hall traffic lights.
Two plants so close to each other: intent or kingdom of shield?
Gutach's mayor clearly answered this question yesterday.
" The town hall light was installed at that time because it ensures the way to school, " Eckert explained yesterday.
The light traffic lights are safe for cyclists as well as bus passengers and mountain residents.
The plant, officially opened yesterday, is important for the intersection of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as traffic flow from the residential area › Grub ‹.
" With the high traffic and pedestrian volume, their safety was caused by additional traffic lights " says Eckert.
Peter Arnold of the Councils Office of Offenburg confirms this.
" According to current measurements, about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality GutGutach every day on the B 33, of which ten percent of these are heavy traffic, " says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another set of lights is extremely necessary: " Safety is going ahead here ", says Arnold.
The main feature of the city's history was the construction of the main parts of the city. the city was built in the the city. at the beginning of the northern part of the city at least the beginning of the second half of the city at the end of the end of the 19th century.
According to Arnold, everything has been tested for the location of traffic light masts: " By means of an extra loaded transporfor us with particularly long strains for wood, we we tested whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without kneading to the traffic masts ".
The EUR 15 000 traffic light system itself is the " most modern system currently available on the market ", explained ArnArnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LELEDs, which shine so so high intensity that the lights can be easily seen by car drivers, for example, even in the low sun.
And it is also economical: the older light systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per driving direction.
Arnold explained the technique of the new system: this is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian moves the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, it comes immediately green for pedestrians, if not, it will take about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for pedestrians can end.
" If a group or handicapped people go across the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will safely safely cross the road, " Arnold said.
Of course, the driver will have to think as a partner here and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green, and an upper class vehicle went through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth from his soul for more than 30 years.
The Carinthian Carinian poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village kindhood - the voice lessness ness, the inclination to raw violence and blunt sexuality, the finrows and happlessness.
The Büchner prizewinner is mainly known as a prosaauthor, theatrical texts are rar in his work.
Collage of prose texts Gerhard, Fresacher puts together a collage of " weather lights on the tongue tip " which is now visible in the garage X at Petersplatz, for his performance composed of profiled texts.
The theatre maker, for example, combines elements of the autoautobiographiographical novel " Der Leibeigene " (1987) with the prosaminiatures of " body nam, auauming his family " (2003).
On the predominlargely empty stage - important requisit: a squskatched sofa on which a hint be copulated and masturbi- the eight-headed ensemble catches through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance performs the template with a abundance of redirects, known from the repertoire of postdramatic play forms.
The actresses in particular get involved in the sometimes somewhat dubious transformations.
They are touched hard, dipped with their head under water, with their evening robes stacked to the wall.
Trapped in cellellophane or mills, they stack on dangerously high stumbling through staging, either monologise them loudly or lie completely dormely on the stage floor.
The text hardly conveys itself in this hard way.
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple ple to folk song.
Only towards the end does the overturned performance come to rest, and WinWinkler ’ s almost absurd humour sparks.
A car blackbox?
American street planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining ating Highway system and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that finds place in the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record every kilometre travelling and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by the Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The usually borboring area of road planning has suddenly provoked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertaries have allied with environmental groups, arguing that the government can use the small boxes to record the miles travelled – and possibly also where they have been driven – and then use the information to calculate tax declarations.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But, while Congress cannot agree on action, several federal states no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how, over the next ten years, they can switch to a system where the driver will pay per mile mile.
Thousands of car drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is, in fact, a must for our country.
“ It is nothing that we will possibly use, ” said Hasan Ikhrata, CEO of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans planning to record the number of miles for all Californian car drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed from the taxes paid by Americans at the fuel station, is bankrupt.
But America is no longer fuelled as much as it did in the past.
Cars consume less petrol.
The government mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurcents per litre) has not risen for 20 years.
The politicians, at high fuel prices, do not dare to raise the tax for just one cent.
“ The petrol tax is simply not sustainable, ” says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
“ This is the best alternative in the long term, ” he said.
bureaucrats call it a mile based user fee.
It is no surprise that the idea is well favour with urban liberals, because the tax, for example, could be used to influence driving behaviour to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust.
California ’ s planners are relying on the system for developing strategies to achieve the state ’ s ambitious, legally enshrined targets on climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also stated that this is the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also attracted by the idea of making drivers pay after the distance returned.
“ This is not a tax disappears in a black hole, ” explains Adrian Moore, vice president for Guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who, in a report in 2011, called on Congress to move towards mile-based settlement.
The US Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project last year that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the push, responding to the concerns of rural MPs who represent people who in everyday life have to travel many miles on their way to work or town.
Several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in this direction.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently drives 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay mileage fees to the state instead of the oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with lorries.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical about thinking that the government could follow each of its movements.
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem, ” explains Alauddin Khan, head of the strategy and earnings management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People did not want it.
When the test started, Nevada ’ s ACLU warned on its website: “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult monitoring devices. ”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the kilometers travelled, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, as Khan said, the public would also be more reassured.
Hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not initially intervene to help federal states tax car drivers.
Rather, their aim was to gain a foothold in an emerging car insurance market, requiring drivers to pay on the basis of miles.
But the devices they tested are also interesting for the street planners because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“ People are more willing to participate in if their speed and locations are not recorded, ” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with giving car drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any equipment at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the miles leelled on average by all residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to sell able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, transport officials want to develop a taxation equipment that allows them to pay pay parking fees, insurance must only be paid for travelling kilometres, and speed data are collected from other vehicles in real time, enabling drivers to avoid traffic jams.
“ Driists would be motivated to participate by the added value of the advantages offered by the system, ” says in a planning document from the city.
But some traffic planners are asking whether all the talk about paying money per mile is not just a huge distraction.
Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for San Francisco Bay declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual tax could be imposed on car drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles consume little petrol so that they, too, pay a fair share.
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient, ” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of car drivers are concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats Wacker
The volunteer fire brigade did their heart test with brave despite a lack of personnel.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
In his acceptance of exercises, department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate Ffeeder in Burgberger Straße.
There is supposed to have been a short circuit when sawing.
The resulting fire and the smoking development injured two people, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After Hans Kammerer's first review of the situation, two respiratory carriers of the gun prepared to enter the building.
After a short time we managed to find the first person and guide outdoors.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, because there was a narrow stairs to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
There were also electric woodworking machines.
The first extinguishing attack took place over the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was via flood hydrants at about 100 meters away.
Three deletion attacks have now been made.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also used the exercise to show what can be done with little available staff.
In the event of emergency support is provided through the daily intervention group Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking between universities and companies
On his visit to Breisgau Highlands Black Forest, Land President Guido Wolf informed himself in Titisee-Neustadt also about where where tomorrow's workforce will come from.
At the High Forest Forest funding centre, he followed this important issue along with with the head of of schools of occupational vocational schools, district secondary school and chairman of the parents' board.
" Education is an important locational factor, " stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project High Black Forest education centre.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011 the rolling town has had a successful cooperation between the funding centre, Kreisgymnasium and the vocational school centre.
He also praised the family friendliness of the county.
" It is important not only to consider the family phase, as a result of demographic change, but also the phase of caring for relatives, " " Wolf Wolf.
He also said that more and more employees were taking care of care and care for their relatives.
" Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to employment relationship, " said Wolf Wolf.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he continued to say.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
" For those who have already learned the benefits of the surrounding region during their studies will often continue to preserve the regional economy with his acquired knowledge and skills, which helps to strengthen the region ", " the President of the Land convinced.
It is only if sufficient training places were offered that the need for skilled workers could be met.
In his opinion, the advantage of the district is its favourable location in south-west of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already made to develop local public transport on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
" Keep remain stubborn and ensure that public transport gets better, " he explained to the local politicians present.
With music an entertaining afternoon
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting Dietinger seniors for coffee, cakes and then to a cup.
In the past, the older citizens were served in the resting place.
This afternoon takes place in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The home residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was a sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with popular melodies.
The over 100 year-old natural stone wall, as the front delimitation of the old school courtyard to Kirchstraße, which is under renovation, is to be put again on the renovation plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the kilbig, during the first work of the refurbishment of the front school yard, a small angular wall wall was installed to stabilize and static relief the over a hundred year old natural stone wall with Balustrade.
Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger City Building Office says that the next step is to include the office of the landmark in the planning and to create a concept of rehabilitation of the old wall.
After that, the costs are to be calculated by experts which will be put on the table of the municipal council to decide and determine the further forward.
A decision on this will probably be taken next year.
After the renovation, paving and plplanting of the old school courtyard within the two wings built in 1912, a follow-up measure, the boundary wall in need of renovation, must be completely tured and placed on new new foundations in the foreseeable future.
The historic one hundredyear old bounditation wall of the old school to the street Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frostal damage with no drainage age age, is in need of renovation and has a arch tendency forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify of damage to the weather, however, the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A stand proof wall is a prerequisite for a student to use a school yard, which has been done by the current fortifications.
Originally, the school refurbishment was even planned in 2008 / 2009, but high unplanned expenditures resulted in a shift.
An important word in the historical restoration of school walls, which has even been used for film recordings, will be spoken by the National Heritage.
If guidelines come from this site, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument protectors.
The pupils of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now taught with a new Aula in a well-renovated old school building, soon be able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants jazz training in Stuttgart.
Cem Özdemir, Chairman of the Greens / European Free Alliance, has also taken part in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
" I think it is wrong to abandon holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart, " said Özdemdemir the " Stuttgart News ".
Jazz and classics belong together at the jazz location in Stuttgart.
Thus Özdemir demir, who in Stuttgart is favourite for a new direct mandate at the federal elections on 22 September, contradicts the Green Red State Government.
On the basis of an expert study this reinforces a reorganization of the five music music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, among other things the programme jazz and pop will pop away from the Musikhochhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule in Mannheim.
US border: " super-tunnel " for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators have discovered and shut down a' super-tunnel' for drug smuggling.
As US customs authorities reported, the more than 500 metre long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and an ventilation system.
Three suspects have therefore been arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated.
According to data, the tunnel had not yet been in use.
" These cartels are stupid when they think they could dig through under the radar, " the prosecutor of the US District of Southern California, Laura Duffy, said at a press conference before a warehouse in San Diego, where an end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Duffy insassured to the drug gangs:' If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money'.
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent struggle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77th 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by Experts
Due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it has been designed by architects and engineers and that the construction has taken about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is located in a building located 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladleads 20 meters into the depth to the actual entrance to the tunnel.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeteters wide.
It would also have been able to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine band.
The third, a Mexican, was caught because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three are in danger of as a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, as officials have said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
However, this is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel building.
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities rather than tunnels.
This shows the " despair " of drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA DEA in San Diego.
They would do everything they can to get to the US.
No details were given about the people detained; at least one of them was Mexican, it was said.
They have to count on prison sentences of up to ten years.
Geisinger Festive Year 2014
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of 1250.
The return of the first written mention is drawing ever closer.
When the year comes to an end in over eight weeks, the jubilee year is to come.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794.
In churches a document was produced in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there is to be an official inauguration for the jubilee year, and since Geisingen does not have a hall at the moment, this opening event will take place in the place where both was first mentioned 121250 years ago in church cabses.
On the occasion of the anniversary, a number of events are planned both in Geisingen as well as in church cabses.
Church houses will July will be the 1250 on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrating again.
On Friday with a festive act, on Saturday and Sunday with a festive held around the church hall.
At this festival weekend there is also the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest.
City Music Director, Rudolf Barth has written an contract position for the city on three dates on the occasion of the anniversary.
On June 21, together with the Sonnwendcelebrations of the Black Forest Association, on July 12 in the Arena Arena with fireworks, and on December 13, as the first concert concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This is finished and inaugurated the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new chronicle is also being brought out.
" However, is not not to become a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about today Geisingen, which is precisely made the up of Geisingen, church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen " " says mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today ’ s Geisingen celebrated its birthday in 2014; in 1974 today ’ s space was completed with the congregations.
The new chronicle is then to be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also another year with many anniversaries.
The straw glonki narratigue festival begins on 8 February with a customs, on the occasion of its 60-anniversary,, harmony harmony Gutmamadingen will take 90 years and has the festival banquet on 29 March and then celebrate the district music festival from 1-4 of May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, while the Geisinger Schule has been at new location for 50 years and celebrates it on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrate it at the Well Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in 764 in a gift certificate by the monastery of St. Gallen St. Gallen.
The document was made in churches (houses), which was a court place at that time.
Both communities are mentioned in the same document.
The reason is to celebrate this 1250-year in 2014; in addition, the municipal reform dates 40 years ago.
Council targets tracks
Should the " Am Hirschen " railway crossing be extensively rebuilt to improve road safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take EUR 220 000 into its hands for this purpose.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, it is to increase safety at railway crossings - there are regular collilisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the communities agree to reconstruction measures, they have to pay for one-third of the costs, the rest are shared by railways and the Confederation.
Schiltach ’ s town builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the BahBahcrossing " Am Hirschen ".
There, the city plans to build expansion at the height of the tunnel mundes to the west of the railway track.
There larger vehicles, for example, those transporting long wood, could stand on opposite traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießtherefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way as for the city to widen the following road in due course in order to flow traffic smoothly.
This was subject a controversial debate in the municipal council because, because some councils cils questioned the need to spread the road: Thomas Kipp summsummed the mood of the critics in his statement:' Do we have to take so much money because of so few vehicles?'
mayor Thomas Haas objected that the railway " Hirschen " crossing is regularly used for langhwood transportation.
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route along the Häberlesbrücke bridge, because they cannot bend bend into the main road.
Moreover, the route serves as a route for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel, Haas argued when the main road is closed.
Since it is foresexpected that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel would have to be rebuilt and restored, as is currently the case in WolWolWolfach, the railway " Am Am Hirschen " could have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to investigate the cost of the idea of widening the road.
In spite of this, a majority have agreed to the reconstruction of the railway crossing on the condition that the necessary support wall will be built in such a way that the city could expand the following road towards the " Bahnhofstraße " road to about 5.5 metres if necessary for meeting traffic.
However, the reconstruction of the railway crossing at Gerberei Trautwein could cause a quite different problem, which relates the access to the sharply rising " Geroltzhäuser Route ".
The administration had had the conversion plans of the railway to be examined by the Breinlinger engineering office because it had any doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser route would easily be possible.
The investigation concluded that it was not ruled out that the conditions of inclination on the road could lead to the use of longer vehicles.
The city is again responsible for this as a road truck carrier.
The restructuring could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber removal and the bending worked in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the reconstruction of the railway transition, HaHaas argued.
At this point, the risk of having a collision of the train with a vehicle at the transition is significantly lower than other railway crossings, because right next to the stopping point, to which there is a good visible connection.
Even trains from the main train station should be braked down at this point that there is no risk of collision.
A majority of them were refused the reconstruction of this railway transition because the city of Schiltttach had to " pay " the problem with busy vehicles, according to the councils because the railways could withdraw from responsibility after construction work has been completed.
The panel considers unproblematic the changes at the railway crossings " Vor Heubach " and " Vor Kuhhbach ", for which crossing agreements have been reached by railway.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Far planets, gravitational waves or black holes - the experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they intend to launch in the coming years.
30 proposals have been made, five are in the race.
Far Worlds.
Astronomers have found more than 1000 planets in other stars.
Nobody knows whether there are lives at least on some of these lives.
The selection is very difficult: Should you search for gravity waves?
Or prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or to search for planets similar to earth earth and thus discover life out of earth?
These questions are raised by those responsible for the European Space Agency Esa.
For their " Cosmic Vision " programme, they seek ideas for two major space projects, which aim to make a decisive advance in research.
The budget for such' L missions' is about one billion euros.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were up the debate and five of them have now come to the list.
Numerous bodies look at the proposals and catch up with the researchers.
In the next few days a final decision is to be taken by the scientific programme committee.
A total of four major questions were selected by Esa in order to answer the missions of the " Cosmic Vision " initiated in 2007.
What are the conditions for planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and, therefore, the formation of planets that circle these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared teltelescope in space could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
To address this question, we are planning to launch the Cheops space telescope in 2017, which will examine 500 already known planetary systems in our near surroundings.
The possibilities, however, are limited. Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map earth-like planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres, looking for " biomarkers ": gases considered an indicator of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately provide information about what conditions there exist for the emergence of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interactions of its magnetic field and the particle radiation it emates with the planetary system.
As an example, these processes can be investigated in our solar system.
With the " Solar Orbiter " the Esa has already approved an M-class mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is to start in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to researchers.
They want to find out what role the Giant planet has played in developing the solar system.
The Esa provides the first of the total of three L missions of the " Cosmic Vision ".
The probe " ice " (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter to investigate the planet's atmosphere and the icy moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
Worldspace offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature that we know are still valid there.
Perhaps we also find deviations that could lead physiphysics the way to a new theory under which roof all the known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe emerge and what is it?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was born by the Big Bang.
In addition to matter we know know, which comprises stars, planets, and living creatures such as us, there is dark matter, gravity of which holds together galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy whose action accelerates the expansion of space.
So far, researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the Big Bang ’ s first fractions, or what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With " Euclid " the Esa has already approved a M mission, which will be launched for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe aims to investigate the distribution of matter in the whole universe for the first time in the whole sky, thus providing conclusions on the nature of Dark matter and Dark energy.
Who could Race the Race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will be left at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, " E-Lisa " has the best chances of approval as an L-mission, an ambitious concept for detection of gravitational waves.
Physicists mean changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
To this day, they have not been proven.
Elisa could achieve that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides for a probe consisting of two or three detectors that is stationed in space.
In contrast to plants on Earth, it could also show gragravity waves that emerged from the Big Bang, providing new knowledge about the emergence of the cosmos.
Four other proposals also compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called " Athena ", which to explore black holes, " Icy Planetets ", another mission to the solar planets, " Prism " a mission mission measuring cosmic background radiation, and " Exoplanet FinFinder " to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
Proposals have already been made for sample sample return from Mars, exploring the moon, the Venus and Asteroids and solar physics.
Snowden ready to cooperate with Germany on US surveillance.
Edward Snowden, the US secret service's whistleblower, declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander give no answers about their activities.
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Ströbele writes: “ Although the outresult of my efforts may have been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat divergent opinion as a cause of loyalty and tries to crimincriminalise political expression with a threat of punishment where no defence is possible. ”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
Snowden writes in Snowden that he is convinced that the international community ’ s support can convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The prosecution brought by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Minister of Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Zeit Online: “ If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to facilitate it. ”
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by allegations that the NSA has tapped the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the parliamentMember who leads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret services, said that one should seize the opportunity to hear SnowSnowden as witness if this is possible, “ without putting him at risk and completely ruining relations with the US. ”
Ströbele, a Green MEP, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists when he visited Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee, Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden points out in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ”, the MEP says.
Snowden explains in his letter that he faces a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that has driven him from his homeland.
But it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression. ”
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a credit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ”.
Frontier Airlines charges charges for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines is planning to demand up to USD 100 from passengers who wish to collect hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to US $100 for one piece of hand baggage and $2 US dollars for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday stated that passengers are likely to keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat seat remain free of charge.
Frontier said that you calculate $25 when the fee is paid in advance, and $100 for travellers who paid at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said that the fee of $100 is aimed at encouraging travellers to attend with payment in advance.
“ We do not want to calculate this sum, ” she explained.
In 2008, airlines began to charge the first and second piece of baggage.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore loaded as much as possible into hand baggage, with the consequence that the luggage bags above the seat are often crowded.
Fees are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money.
It concerns the most faithful customers of Frontier tier who would have clearly stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may take a piece of baggage with free at the Frontier Frontier gate but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of baggage.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they came to the boarding gate.
Frontier hand baggage fee from Frontier will only take effect in the summer, and there is not yet an exact date.
Passengers often charge baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to use them.
They argue that the transport of the baggage should cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street regard the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most have left their fingers of charges for hand baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded the first charges for hand baggage three years ago and later followed by Allegiant Air, a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained by the airline adviser Jay Sorensen, who is closely following the the additional fees.
In a report published in December 2011, he estimated that the Spirit's hand baggage fee would raise $50 million per year.
Sorensen, who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines Airlines, recently flown with Spirit, and was curious about what he would expect expect at the boarding gate when passengers were confronted with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage fee.
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth that I experienced in my career in aviation, ” he said.
I expected to see teeth craashing and handful discussions at the boarding gate.
“ The plane was full, ” he explained “ and boarding was lubricated. ”
Frontier also follows Spirit in the $2 dollars required for coffee, tea, limonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought a lemonade or juice were allowed to keep all whole cans, and coffee coffee was filled free of charge.
Water remains free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks, but it undo this seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company followed suit.
Frontiers step to charging charges for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the most recent initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides all companies with an incentive to encourage passengers to buy them directly from them, rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, miles were reduced once again to 25% of the flight route.
This means why a Frontier flight of over 1000 miles with a booked third party brings customers customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can only reserve seats when purchasing tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrking and the company is losing money.
Rproceeds fell by about 9 percent and flight capacity shrlined under 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
Republic has tried to control Frontier's finances as part of selling society.
Proverwords come from the Bible
More good 40 women visited the last women's breakfast this year in the Protestant parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the House were " proverwords from the Bible " and " Middle Ages phrases ".
Zita Köhler, the Chairman of the Council of the Church, gave a lecture on the biblical proverwords after breakfast.
" Proverwords contain ways of life, regulations or warnings, " she explained.
She compared several proverwords with the corresponding Bible posts and explained the meaning.
She mentioned proverwords like: wooden eyes are vigilant, as scales fall from their eyes, cast an eye on someone who the Lord gives him in sleep, wash his hands innocence.
On several occasions, the speaker also advised her listeners what proverb it was.
Christel Dehner accepted the church ’ s various phrases from the Middle Ages: All good things are three, blue, look a little.
She explained the importance and origin of the phrases, which she called " bridges to the past ".
Finally, we raffle a raffle.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round there was also a mixture of the mayor candidate, Roman Waizenegger.
Learning rather than unemployed: pilot project for unskilled in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry started at the Mecklenburg Mecklenburg Lake plat.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry are expected to be qualified as specialists for hotels and restaurants over three winter inters.
" New thing is that the six-month courses end with degrees, " said Carmen Wiechert of the labour agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are manifold: participants would not make them unemployed, they would give firms trained professionals who were increasingly absent in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel- and Gastering Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA claims that an “ internal error, ” and not hackers are to blame for the site crash.
The shady National Security Agency declared, on late Friday, that an error has paralysed its public website for several hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
“ NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight, because an internal error occurred during a planned update, ” the spspying agency explained in an email sent by e-mail.
The problem will be remedied this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening hours online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unaccessible for at least six hours and is still not for some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesman declared to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the agency was “ in no way ” compromised.
Secret information is not at risk, says the speaker.
At least one group of hackers claimed to paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple, and attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was the No Such Agency Agency, now finds itself in the light light of the public and finds itself after the revelvelations made in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyperoperation.
The number of people without jobs fell slightly by 22 in October to 1,307.
Although the quota of 3.1% is better than last year and also better than in September, " we would have hoped for more, " says Monika Felderder-Bauer, Vice-manager of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen.
A large number of companies have reacted in recruitment so far.
One reason for this, according to Felder-Bauer: " We have few specialists in handicrafts, health care and care for the elderly ".
Due to the seasons of the year, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been in again since September.
The winter season begins in mid-December.
The full background report on this is available in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt dated 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Loss of profit at Bombardier after a decline in supply numbers and orders
The Canadian, Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardidier Inc announced a 15% declines in net net net profit on Thursday after after he came under pressure by declining orders and deliveries of 3third-quarter aircraft as well as contract problems in the railway segment.
Bombardier based in Montreal did did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go to commercial use according to the ambitious timetable next September.
Only three more launches so far on the maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is running as planned.
The results fell short of the forecasts and led to a fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto stock exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday reduced his rating from “ outperform ” to sector perform, so that the share has limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
“ Weweaker deliveries for aircraft were widely expected, but we are clearly disappointed disappointed by margin in the transport sector, ” said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the aircraft test program progresses.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft range will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time after months delay in September.
But, so far, binding orders for CSeries are 177 moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and see whether the company ’ s claims about fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new airjet aircraft are true.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Board Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
Corporate management also assured to analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme is on the schedule.
“ The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected, ” Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the service life of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer is planning in a different way.
We have decided to take a first flight and then append a period of review which is what we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight programme.
The second out of five test aircraft will probably start in the next few weeks, the rest very shortly after, was said from the company.
Yet analysts remain sceptical tical whether 12 months after the maiden flight, the first customer will be able to operate a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier stated that it reviewed the planning for start-up (EIS) and will update it in the next few months.
“ The slow progress of the flight test – although they obviously correspond to Bombardi’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that start-up shifts to the first quarter of 2015, ” DoDoerksen.
In the third quarter, ending on September 30, Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share from $172 million or $9 cents per share per year.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents unchanged.
Sales declined slightly, and declined from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer has es that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
The net fruit orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order book in the aerospace sector was $32.9 billion on 30 September, which remained unchanged from 31 December.
“ In the aerospace sector, the results were within our targets, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing, ” said Beaudoin.
Revenues in the aerospace sector fell by 13 per cent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this segment have increased by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on 30 September, which was slightly higher from 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to corporate management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In afterafternoon trading on Thursday, the Bombardishare decreased by 8.5 percent, up to $4.83 Canadian dollars after it was announced that Google's Executive Officer Patrick PiPichette will change to the Board.
The Brazilian Embraer er SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardiers' closest rivals, reported a 10% decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday.

Cocaine addicted lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must be in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information on the underworld size Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer was afraid that his covert drug addiction could come to light.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpooler Crown Court.
A well-known criminal defender, who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he feared that his secret drug addiction could be exposed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided subworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his activities in the drug trade after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
Poguised by criminals as a “ first class ” lawyer nicknamed “ Bash ” was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police oversaw Scarborough which he represented in an earlier drug trial.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine to the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a bar's dinner.
The investigation revealed that Dittitta regularly consumed A drugs after tests revealed traces of cocaine had been found in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were monitored by the police at the time of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million in a series of house sesearches and £200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, passed information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be publicised.
Today, Ditta, working for the Forbes Solicitors firm in Blackburn, was found and sentenced at the Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges of hpediment the justice.
He admitted cocaine ownership during an earlier survey.
The lawyer was arrested after the police discovered in investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigative officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house and put the drugs under the lawyer's rubstbin with 60% purity in a black golf glove.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly made a telephone to Ditta who spent dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
It became known in court that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after testing class A drugs had been discovered in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocacaine and said he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that her discussion was subject to lawyers lawyer secrecy.
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was removed.
During the police interrogation he stated that he ran an office both at his private address and at the workplace and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it became known that he had called important players in drug trafficking, some of whom he previously represented, after significant arrests and informed of what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else you do not break the law. ”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker but a drug trafficker who supplies drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these people.
But this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta rejected any misconduct and asserted: “ If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to give information to Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but do so immediately. ”
But, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: “ Mr Ditta took the step from a defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to buy drugs from organized criminals. ”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime who asked him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Ditta betraaded this trust and tried to hide himself behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Dittitta, which also resulted in three cases for the possession of cocaine and obstacles of justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that none of them can evade the arm of the law.
We find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being guilty of conspiracy in heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was as lawyer lawyer representing clients in the death death death cell in America, and that his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity is the motivation for his work.
The Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the end of the celebrations of its 160-year anniversary Liederkranranz z Dunningen will frame two religious services with the " Deutscher Messe " by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical " Rock Rock my Life ", which inspired the spectators in the spring this year, at the end of the anniversary year the Liederkranz will provide two religious services with the performance of the German Fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair in the St. Martinus Church of Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27 from 10.15 a.m. at the church service in St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe, with the original title " Songs ts the Celration of the Sacred red Sacrifice ", D 872, is a spiritual work by composer Franz Schubert dating from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of birth.
The fair is performed within the scope of divine services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism is giving way to confidence
The elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, will change fundamental things in the ministry unit Haslach (SE).
There is then only a common parish council for all six parish rates.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies of Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach bach,, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
There is nothing more to change about the basic decisions of the Diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day became particularly clear: skepticism about the new is hesitant but increasingly giving way to confidence.
The extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the team of sailors have range from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish council.
With a presentation, regional Regional dekan Georg mitmitt explained the newly defined guidelines for the units of ministry in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
In the future, SE Haslach, as a church community, will form in future a body of public law which will enter the rights and duties of the hitherto six individual church communities.
There will only be a common parish council and a council of foundations, in which the parish est ’ s office is represented.
At least two elected members should be represented from each parish; in the six parish prizes, so-called community teams are formed on the ground.
In the future, their task will be to promote church life in the place.
On the question of the finances of the individual parish community, there was a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations mean that accumulated credits will be kept in the parish rates.
The liabilities, by contrast, are transferred to the entire community.
There was great concern, particularly with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment will then hit all parish rates.
" In the past past, only investment has been made in projects that could be managed by individual parish prizes alone ", relatived chairman of Haslach ’ s parish council, Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a common body for five parish rates described Barbar knights, the chairman of the board in the ministry unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
In 2006, they set themselves the task of becoming one, remaining five' and had to discover that this is not so easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher parish unit then about to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be finalised in further meetings and be decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
At the end, parish parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the unit of ministry approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity becomes more expensive
Pfulllendorfs must adjust for higher electricity costs.
As the CEO of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed in comparison to the SÜDKURURIER, a four-year-old Pfullendorfer family will ur an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEG levy rate from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This levy is redefined every year in October by the four operators of the large electricity streers.
These estimate the additional costs resulting from the switch of energy that they can charge the price of electricity, through a levy.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company even had predicted of a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before next week the municipal works could inform their customers about the exact increase in prices.
" We expect an increase of 1 cent cent plus x ", says Bias, but the figure will be close to 2 cents.
Long red traffic light: watch for wait.
Sometimes a traffic light is not green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the sign of light is broken.
What should we do - driving red?
If a concerned waited long enough at a red traffic light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad ".
However, the waiting period must be' reasonable', which can be interpreted in case-by-case ways.
Becker advises to wait at least five minutes before the traffic lights start to function.
However, if you continue to travel despite the red light, you must be aware that they are entirely to blame for an accident or accident.
Those who tolerate less than five minutes may not wait long enough warns Becker and points to a decision by the Upper Supreme Court Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent breach of red light.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped to green little later.
He was spared a driving ban on account of the special situation - but not the fine.
Local Council welcomes a sound Budget
Whenever the budget is discussed at municipal council meetings, mayor Ralph GerGerster has laughed well.
The municipal bakery in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not known known the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a complete success in this sense.
This became clear from the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was over one million million higher than planned, estimated at around EUR 7.6 million.
The surplus of the administrative budget would also be around one million above the line at around EUR 1.8 million.
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the community ’ s share of income tax.
The wealth budget, too, was well above the planned levels.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million earmarked, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
'This is essentially due to the higher input from the administrative budget', as Rothmund says.
In the 2012 financial year, less investment was made than planned, the supply of refunds has also been higher.
In total, the general reserve has been increased by around EUR 2.1 million to now a total of EUR 4.9 million.
mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
" Such a work is not simply shake off the sleeve, " praised Gerster with regard to the annual accounts.
He and the municipal councils were clearly rejoicing at the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon be expensive for the citizens.
The good financial situation has allowed the municipality to do without high leverage in the past.
According to Gerster, however, this often cut back subsidies from the country.
There are preconditions for these subsidies from various compensatory levels.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must show certain levers.
" We have to look at the issue of levers, because in the coming years investment is due for which we would like to receive grants, " Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60, Hubert ’ bert Wermter ’ s history at the Cäcilia lia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest he was solemn honoured.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his men's singing club.
After sixty years, singing is still a great fun with the choir that has been won with more than love.
Wermter was also active in the club, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and his loyalty to association he he immediately received several awards: Jörörerg Kohr, pastoral referent on behalf of the Cacilien association Rottenburg-, Stuttgart, presented him - because the choir is also a church choir - with a certificate from the association and a letter of honour signed by bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singing colleagues handed him the certificate of the German Choral Association and an engraved tin plate.
The 1st umn Festival Festival took place in the early days of the opening of the festival.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " Im Weinparadies " and " Lustig, her brothers ".
They gave their honorary singer Hubert Wermter a little conto honour - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ’ s " Bundeslied ".
Betmale's singing association band also sang classical choral songs like " Jägerwerben " by Julius Wengengert, " Wengert, " far, far away " by Hubert Goisern, and the folk song " When you pass through the valley ".
The mixed mixed choir and his women's group - the Liederkranz Salzstetten - - the " impulschor " - were responsible for the women's rate of the festival.
The mixed choir was abducted with the Neapolitan folk " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana ", by Antos Gus to foreign countries, while the " impulse " also referred to foreign languages: " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " were to their programme.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back, with " Was isch der Schwob? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's " Bierlied ", to the homilage, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the glaring musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side programme - " Oma Hanne " alias Hannelore, StStollsteimer performed a Kasperl theatre and read a couple of stories about the children at midday about well busy.

Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
‘ We are in a daunting situation situation and and one can ask ourselves: what is going to prevent Parliament tomorrow from simply abolishing judicial independence? ’ was read in the newspaper newspaper, which considers the draft bill to be unconstitutional.
“ The law is draconian and very puntive and we reject it, ” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government, ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy.
“ I hope the President will stens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament, ” he said.

Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts were raised about creating an artificial grass field, which was generally considered to be the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were set up two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erlecht, promised a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square and the country approved funding funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the Municipal Council decided to pay the remaining EUR 356 000 at the total cost of EUR 560 000, summarized Klumpp.

Milk and egg Alternatives
Vegan diet requires vegetable alternatives to eggs, milk, and dairy products.
Pushed tofu with plant steel is, for example, a quark-replacement.
The vegetarian confederation cites others on the vegegDay on 1 November.
The vegetarian arian federation of Germany proposes on the occasion of the World Wine Day on 1 November, a series of vegan alternatives:

Sleep in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest high school met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight we went to Brooklyn Bridge, which on foot reached the heart of the city, Manhattan.
It already offered a fascinating view of the world-famous skyskyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
With time shifting students were on their feet almost 24 hours, but true to the motto of " The city doesn't sleep sleep " the day was decided at Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, the statue of freedom was reached by ferry and reached on foot on the second day.
It then went through the financial center around Wall Street to commemorate September / 11.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating city city, from the 373 meter platform platform Empire-State Buildings and enjoy the view.
After that we went through the bustle and bustle of the New York streets via the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which was an ideal opportunity to spend a while in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, students have arrived in their host host families and experience everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on Hubertus ’ s name day, a Huberbertus fair will be held in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the legend after a rather ruthless hunter, who was converted by a vision and later was appointed the bishop of Liège.
The hunting hunt group of Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth is performing on Parforcehörns for old, originally French melodies.
The wind wear riding dresses, because they mainly musically accompany riders, horses, and dog meats on trag-hunting.
The solemn fair will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 a.m..
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to Déjà Vu, the Lexicon describes it as a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling that have already experienced or seen a new situation.
In case of a visit to the cafe of the same name at Opschlag in the district town of Kleve within visible distance to the Rhine-Waal University, it does not need to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
After all, the café with its beautiful name has the aim: to make a real stay not only in mind, but always in a recurring experience.
Because it is fun and simply beautiful.
A glance at the inner life of the Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at the start.
The ultra-modern but not cool cafe ambience looks like a place to feel good.
The team spoils guests with founderMirjam van der der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with a wide variety of coffee or cocktail options.
There are also delicious cakes or individually baked fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves as gastronomrestaurant before the opening of the pretty cafcafé at the opschlag: in Kranranenburg they ran the " Art Lounge ".
From the move to Kleve Kleve to the Opschlag schlag, friendly café lovers hope for more audience.
Not least through the University of Applied Sciences.
" We do not have a specific target group " stresses Daniel Büttner.
The two students want to address here young students in the same way as seniors and all ages in between.
Speaking of café lovers.
The nice couple of owners stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew itself in the most varied variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
" A baguette - that is my thing " she betrays to the NRZ.
Two events were already held in the luminous café.
Better to say one thing.
After all, the port's festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not take advantage from it.
But there was also marigring evening.
" Beautiful, successful and funny " found the two 33-year-olds.
But it is not everyone's business.
Perhaps that is why Daniel Büttner is not a true fan of event evenings:' It is not possible to please everyone'.
And with an event I always address those who are interested in the special event.
Therefore, events will rather be the exception with us.
" We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible ".
In other words: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
As regards the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which is developing more and more into a piece of gastronomy.
To the delight of many Klevers, the guests from near and far away and the students who discover for themselves the Gastromeile, and thus also the Café Déjà Vu.

UN announces new poverty reduction targets
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a number of new objectives in order to replace the Millennium Development Goals on poverty poverty, announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “ Sustainable Development Goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals that expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document to be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon declared at the summit the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests. ”
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to begin a process aimed at agreeing universal, sustainable development goals, ” he said.
“ These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the member states to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals. ”
Even though SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball league has a good mood.
Trainer, Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this.
Everyone is still fully motivated.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
" Because I don't know how such a victory looks like, " Malmon expects an experience of success from his team team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the Third League reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet wiped out trees, Malmon warns the finginger in the run-up.
I trained a lot of players myself in the A youth.
That is why they will be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
" Furthermore, we have to wait if there is further strength from the first ", " illustrated in the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon-team must continue to increase compared the previous appearances.
Most importantly all, it was finally a huge deal in the cover work and the switching game.
The exploitation of opportunities must also definitely be improved.
So I hope that my players have finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watcheye of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique, to make calls for peace at a rare public demonstration.
“ We want peace again, we want stability, ” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
Fear of the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the label “ We call for safety ” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on the Independence Square of the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later South South African aparthapargovernment in an effort to destabilise the country ’ s independent government.
In the wake of the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will fall back into full-fledged conflict, but recent events have troubled foreign investors and locals.
There is a lot at stake for the rapidly growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal storage facilities in the northwest could bring in investment of more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Italian Eni, and Anadarko in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by, on 17 October, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces forces attacked the Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
In regard to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself a “ loloser, ” who wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government. ”
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
However, the concerns have increased since Mazanga was cited that Renamo is abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously, ” said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
“ We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who lilash their heads, ” says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good negotiating and nobody is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pressing for electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos success has been shrinking since 1992, while a recent party, the Movimento Democrático de Moççambique, founded by a former Renama member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy.
“ He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency, ” Mazanga says.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo amo has, but it has made disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, which is Beira, using the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto VVale to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of railways for a month, after Renamo had announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded cautiously in asking whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique, ” said Mazanga.
Instinstability has further increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of abductions.
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that he should find solutions to the problems, ” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people simply wanted stability.
“ Nobody interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again, ” he explained.
Children should be taught myths, and legends as “ models of life, ” one author says.
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks, ” and Artus legend how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths are “ by far too wild, too offensive and, in some cases, too dirty to be taught schools, ” which is why Crossley-Holland called for a “ careful selection ” of age-old works.
“ I find it wonderful that in America, myths and folklore are already part of the education, ” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that authors and teachers who were “ excessively didactic ” would “ shut off ” children altogether, because the messages were “ subliminal ” in entertaining stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and the author of Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: “ You can pursue certain intentions, but, if possible, keep them in the background. ”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and an author who writes for children, lies in the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminal, revealed by history, and not explained.
This is the old story of pointing rather than telling.

Schrill ’ s Piepsen disturthers residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They are distributing the coal coming from the ships.
The company has several iron in the fire at the site.
Besides the coal glue port, Rhenus Midgard relies on winding logistics.
Black shimters the coal on the storage site in front of the dike.
Two huge blue blue stacks and rechargers will distribute or load the coal as needed.
Every time the handling equipment is moving, a shy warning noise shines over the ground.
" The signals serve safety and are prescribed by law, " says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in unfavourable wind, this is widely heard - and so there have been some complaints from people from the town order.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old old.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals with technical measures.
He will continue to rely on an open dialogue with his neighbours.
Matthias Schrell has something ahead of the site.
With the extension of the Lower Saxony Saxony bridge Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on the coal glue port for power plants and in this sector is one of the major companies in Europe.
Thanks to the 18.5 meter deepened deck in front of the terminal, capize-bulk carriers can also be made here.
" This year we want to crack the 3 million ton ton brand in the envelope, " says Schrell.
In addition to the local Eon-power plant, imported coal goes to power stations in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez power plant enters the network, a good 5 million tonnes of coal glue per year would be realistic.
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second conveybelt could create up to 10 million.

Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birth of stand-up -up comedy edy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay ay worked as a Conférenrencier at Palace Theatre at Broadway, started telling the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays's innovation has been expanded, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution CarolCarolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“ Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became ever more successful until they were eventually known to perform in a club, ” said Hirsch.
We designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year ’ s event features appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as “ Stand Up for Heroes ”, an annual music and comedy event for army soldiers in the Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival the world of comedy has grown.
A number of the comedians participating in the festival this year have become known through more unconventional channels, such as shows on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironically slzzy fantasy football series “ The League ” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast at “ Saturday Night Live ” and at “ Parks and Recreation ”, even though she is best known for her viral video series “ Marcel Shell with Shoes On ”.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic distinctive voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, ironic W. Kaumau Bell, focused on race issues) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival's biggest visitor magnets is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a television entitled “ Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg ” at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“ The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry ’ s entire work, ” Steinberg said.
He told me that if he is here, then sometimes he walks through the lanway between two buildings and thinks himself: Hey ey if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here.
Iran is satisfied with the Process of Nuclear Negoti
Iran is itself with the five UN veto powers and Germany is satisfied with the negotiating process one week before the next nuclear meeting.
" After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to dispel the differences of recent years, " Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad wrote Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that both sides will end up finding a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: boys kill playmen with Machete
Two children admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two boys, aged 14 and 12 years old, had invited their victims to go with them on bird hunting.
Armed with machetes and knives they reached the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper " El País " on Thursday.
They would then have played football in front of their homes in a working quarter.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach resort Punta del Este.
As alibi, a five-year half-boy half-sister who had taken with her was supposed to say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the hearthersion before the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year old.
As a reason, the elderly called among other things a rivalry in the football match.
He was, for the time being, into a psychiatric youth institution.
Pimpered in jail
Because of exploitative trafficking in human beings, pimp, threat, insinsult and dangerous bodyinjury, the District Court of Konstanz has condemned a 33-year old man from St. Georgen to spend three and a half years in prison.
The former German army soldier, who worked as a door hosteper after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial agreement.
In this way, he was able to create a variety of of, music,,,,,, music,,,,,, music,,,, music,,,, music,,,,, music,, music,,,, and,,,,, and beyond, and to the the the world of and beyond.
He used to break with violence and threats.
He retained the income of women, some of whom he purchased for him for years.
He confiscated contacts with the women outside world by confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards.
Together with a colleague who transferred women, he brought them to various brothels in the south-west.
There he had them partly monitored in order to control their revenue.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma, after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert hinted great doubts about mental curtailment and, therefore, about limited guilt, the 33-3-year-old old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the harmed women.
As a Krio official reported, at least four other cases of exploitative trafficking in human beings could be identified after a first notification through telephone surveillance measures.
The intercepted talks were marked by a high level of aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness in which one of the women had discovered blue spots throughout the body body, has not made no statement.
It is " a completely broken personality " who considers violence and exploitation to be normal in this profession.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
" He freseparated himself from these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after detention, " he said.
Oil prices continue to yield up to USD 96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference station for deliveries in December had decased late in the morning in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8% in October.
The large supply of raw oil has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy declared on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday Friday, there were indications of increased demand by means of two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This points to a continued recovery in China ’ s economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8% in the third quarter, after at the lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
crude oil of type Brent, a reference value for international crude oil also used by refineries, fell by 26 cents at the ICE Exchange in London to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decisions on the NYPD Stop-and-Risk Directive
On Thursday, a federal appeal court in the USA blocked the order of a judge who had demanded changes to the stop-and-risk-program (“ stop and search ”) of the New York City police department and freed the judge from the case.
The 2nd Court of Appeals declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a decision had been taken on the city.
In August, the judge had judged that the city was violating the Constitution with the way in which the programme for holding and consulting people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and remedial measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its directive and its training programme.
The Court of Appeals heard on Tuesday the arguments about the call for suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be freed from the case, because she breached the Code of Conduct for US judges, stipulating that a judge should avoid the disappearance of partiality; this was partly based by a series of media interviews, and public statements about she responding publicly to the Court ’ s criticism.
The judge had judged that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were unduly targeted targeting black and Latin American men with stop-and-risk programs.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms to directives, training and service supervision and ordered a pilot programme with body borne cameras in quarters, where most controls were carried out.
In August, the City of New York declared ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were sacked after police control.
An official appointment of the city is scheduled to take place on March 14, 2014. The appointment of the city to the the capital of the city will be an extension of oral and oral negotiations after the end of 14 March 2014.
Stop-and-risky tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
Controllecks of this kind have been available for several decades, but the number of recorded controls during the term of partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time height of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, an suit was filed by four men belonging to all the minorities, which developed into a collective suit.
Supporters of changes to NYPD D ’ s stop and risk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police force, and influence how other police police presidents use the regime.
Opponents believe that changes will dampen the morality of the police but not crime; nor would money be wasted and not solve the wider problem of a police force that is under pressure after removing thousands of posts in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not put an end to the stop and risk practice which is constitutional, but only the way in which controls are implemented by the NYPD.
The Good fortune of the Dreaming Camels
Luluck is an oasis that manages to reach only dreaming camels.
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman, Wolfgang Henne, described the history and fascination of the association " Helfende Hands ".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already show considerable success.
The first Chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association.
He was the first time in Mauritania himself in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajedhospital in Nouakchott.
Subsequently, further cooperation developed, and the gynaececologist Henne carried out numerous operations on the spot on several journeys.
During the speeches, pictures of the missions were shown on a large screen so that the guests of the jubilee event had an idea of the mentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association has also been shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip it with a new photovoltavoltaic system and now, according to Henne, plans to play an advisory role at the association.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the sickbay in Socogim in the record time of barely a week, a slery ery on the outskirts of the capital - honorary.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott.
It is particularly interesting in times when the birth clinic is integrationalized in Nagold.
You learn much in Africa, as a doctor, Henne, for example deforestation against burn-out.
Due to political unrest in the country it was not possible to make as many journeys as planned, but that is why many medical professionals came to Germany to host here in various areas.
In addition, containers are regularly sent to Africa, including in March of this year, medical equipment, medication, comative material, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself supplied abundance of local colour by telling Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile Ziegstable from Mauritania and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians who traditionally support the club on their Mauritanian trip.
As his personal motives, he named his work in auditing matters as a young MEP.
When he had realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel stressed that a global economy also demands global love for human beings.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
From Gran Canaria not far to Africa.
Coulson used telephone hacking to check tips.
The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson alledly used “ telephone hhacking, surveillance, and confrontation ” in an attempt to confirm a wrong tip about an affair by then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Public Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper asked the private detective, Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlley ’ s voicemails and pursued them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court learned.
“ Coulson Prosecutor believes that Couloulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is no one in front of people ’ s homes and hopes to catch them for fresh action, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their response, ” EdiEdis.
He said that NotW uses three methods for investigatively researching stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently he knows about the second, monitoring, it cannot be otherwise.
What about the first?
Does he know about telephone hacking?
He denies that, but we say, “ And whether he knew about it. ”
Rumors ors of a Clarkes affair were first picked up by the editorial staff of NotW when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “ Don ’ t waste your time, it is together with Charles. ”
A band of voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective computer on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects ”.
At the time the research went, the grandparents received anonymous calls from Pawlby asking them for information about them, explained Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weathertherup supervised the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail as follows: “ I have a story that we want to release tomorrow, which I would like to discuss with Charles. ”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story story followed the same pattern as other major personalities such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The juries heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced with a married woman because of an affair when he himself was liated with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks deny that they have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted telephone hacking.
In protest against the planned Reichensttax, the French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting comes to an end without any results.
In the conflict over the Reichtax, the government and professional football players in France have manoeuvaged themselves into a impasse following a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received the association and association representatives at Élysée-Palace Palace on Thursday and listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare the football from the planned 75-% levy on income of more than EUR 1 million per year, which all companies in the country are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side, too, remained tough.
The strike announced for the end of November will now go through, said the Chief Association of professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The match days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are scheduled between November, 29 and December 2.
No absolute protection Gechingen
" We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage ", mayor Jens Häußler opened the civic information event on the concept of flood protection in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come to the municipal ity-hall to get an explanation of the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to introduce ideas.
Häußler made clear:' The final decisions are taken by members of the municipal council'.
The floods that hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009, unprepared, had been a profound event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, says Häußler.
A river area investigation had been commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen which is the basis for the concept of flood protection in Gechingen.
" Protecting as many cultivated as possible is the goal, " Häußler.
According to the weather service, the planning of the protection against a flood which is statistically expected every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% supplement.
In professional circles this is called " HQ 100aKlima ".
The masses of water that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 amounted to a 1000 year old flood.
" There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement, " says Häußler.
In order to achieve HQ 100aClimate protection, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, whereby the municipality can count on state subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, Häußler pointed out that funding will only exist if an overall concept is implemented.
To this end, the community is dependent on the participation of citizens.
It is necessary to complete an elaborate planning and approval procedure.
At best, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the concept of protection that was already presented in the Municipal Council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the flow of the river of Irm from the Val Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to raise their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why more dams and reserint basins were not planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner the commissioned engineering agency Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept concept, stressed that it requires the interplay of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal.
In addition, it is necessary to find the most economical solution, says Joachim im Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Unreigned among residents of the Altort who constantly suffer an overload of the channel network, even with normal thunderrain.
Administration is aware of the problem and initial measures have already been taken.
Häußler, however, pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different than for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obligated to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three-year reevents could be held.
dimensioning the sewage channels larger would devour millions.
Heavy injuries after collision
On early Friday afternoon, two car drivers were seriously injured in a frontal clashes on the main road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely but were able to say little about the start of the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should first be evaluated.
It is certain that the 19-year-old steering woman of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles crashed together, the woman being so severely trapped that the fire brigade took almost half an hour to free them from the vehicle wreck.
The real cause of the accident was ununresolved. The main cause of the first accident was the first of the first accident of the first of the accident, then the first and the the, and the first of all the explanation of the cause of the accident.
Both those who were injured came to nearby hospitals.
The track was closed for about two hours.
One could call him the US Dostoyevsky.
Philip K. Dick was a god secher, a metaphysician, his novels and narratives also have something serious.
dazzling the kinship in the outside: the smking eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski with his massive oeuvre vre as the founder and apologet of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet who is something in his own country.
Some titles have been published at Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives sells two thousand thousand.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoanoia, security obia, and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of John's revelation and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, had added drugs to his brain.
He captured, early on, that the computers are divinties.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the creator from his creature.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
Master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The Minority Report dates from 1956 and reveals the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals.
The principle of " Pre-crime " is developed here, " Pre-Crime ", i.e. what is now the more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is like our alarmingly, mutants look to the future - and the police are spreading.
" We capture individuals who have not breached any law, " says the head of the authority.
" We snap them even before they can commit a violent crime. "
And: " In our society there are no serious criminals, for that we have a criminal camp full of pesudo criminals ", they read streams of time.
They assume that bad is happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick narrative works like the blueprint for the anti-terrorist laws and the tapping rush of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: That is how Obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick ’ s story is not yet over.
The police chief complains that there is no separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
The monitor will then be supervised and a future crime will be committed.
The system rotates.
It is perfect, but it lies.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Not only takes up mistakes and victims, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it combats.
Reading Philip K. Dick means constantly getting closer to the truth.
The late haffffes of Merkel in Russia
The former US intelligence service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements on his Russian asylum in the US late haffff German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German federal attorney could either ask questions in writing or also meet the 30-year-old old in person in Russia, reported the agency Interfax.
Prior to, Hans-Christian Ströbele Hans-Christian Ströbele met yesterday as the first German politician, Snowden in Moscow to talk about the affair.
NSA revelations intensify corporate paranoia because of government surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Fight Terrorism (BVT), the German Internal Intelligence Service, he should photograph the roof of the US foreign post, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antenna and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted in September that the US did not deploze foreign espionage “ to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to increase their international competitiveness or profit. ”
But, since Edward Snowden, who once became a Whistlebleblower, has begun to publish his filling le to US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director at their word.
Reports that the American National Security Agency has spsped the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquiring data from American cloud providers, including Google Google and Yahoo, have brought corporate paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The barrel overflow led the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s telephone had been wounded, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then it is certain that corporate managers are also potential goals.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence and companies transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
“ Germany must wake up, ” explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US is now at almost as risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consultant company EY.
But the documents leaked by Snowden provide no evidence that the US has passed on business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU should lack certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Businesses are sceptical.
The Bundestag suggested that we should build German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly...
“ This doesn ’ t work, ” says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If we had wanted a strong European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to extinct 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, reach and technical sophisticfinement shocked the US spy authorities, uncovered by the revelations of Snowden authorities that had previously seen the greatest risk of spspying in China.
With cloud computing, cloud computing is changing because European leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurisdiction jurisdiction and is therefore potentially endangered.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, following the revelations about the US data-a-mining activities with Prisrism, about ten% of non-US-based members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP Deputy Managing Director, says: “ We see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago – it is: Where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that they physically remain in this legal area? ”
Many German corporate leaders believe that the most recent reports simply confirm what they have already known anyway, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore they must be guarded at all costs.
It is no surprise that economic espionage is taking place.
That has always been the case.
“ It has been a subject for many years and has not changed changed by the current discussion, ” says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying us at a commercial and industrial level, just as we are doing so, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate management does not normally boast of the countermeasures that have been taken, because this brings benefits to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been imagin that the inclusion of a free USB stick at a trade fair or the unguarded letting of a laptop laptop in the hotel room would not be advisable, to say mildly.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of car manufacturer AuAudi, says that it has been part of standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board board meeting so that they cannot be used as intercepeption devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid mobile phones when they go on travel abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid mobile phones will be thrown away afterwards.
There is concern, however, that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany many of these companies are world leaders in each niche.
“ Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff, and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access, ” BVT warns in a report.
The US warns companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February France, Russia, and Israel ranked behind China as two of the countries used to obtain economic hacking data.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to business espionage, “ the French are the worst. ”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency, DCRL, was quoted in an interview earlier this month: “ The secret services know very well that all countries, working together in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies. ”

The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a Ringermatmatte in the gym of his high school, are convinced that their grandson was murdered, explained the lawyer of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was found on 11 11 January in a sustained mat that stood behind the grandstand in SchulturnHall.
Johnson's investigofficers at Sheriff Lownowndes County concluded that Johnson doubted when he died in an accident accident, which the family 17171717--year-old doubted. But Johnson was convinced, in the same time by the the officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County,, that Johnson had died in a tragic accident.
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered, ” said Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson ’ s lawyer to FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed he had died as the Sheriff concluded.
“ They believe that there is no logic to violate the laws of physics as well as against common sense, ” says Crump.
Rather, they believe that the truth is covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for their son's death.
“ Her son went to school for learning and came back in the body bag, ” he commented.
US Proprosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death because a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death attributable to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction.
My aim is to find out the truth.
“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation, ” he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy deout that Johnson died as a result of “ posiposition-related suffocation. ”
A second autopsy caused another cause of death, says Moore.
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed, ” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death death, he would ask the FBI to conduct investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriffs Authority was not ready to comment immediately in response to our request on Thursday.
A court in the south of Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The teenager's parents said that they hoped that the video recordings contained hints of how he died.
CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for children's food allergy allergies in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the US government, as the number of school children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools, are intended to make the lecturers and staff staff aware of food allergies, and how care should be taken with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin in stock – auto injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to deal with a potentially deadly oversensitivity reaction.
Federal legislatlegislators recently amended the rules for schools to keep Epepephrin more easily in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with an allergic reaction.
Children may say: “ It feels as if something is pressed on my tongue ”, “ My tongue feels as if a hair is on it ” or “ My tongue is cribled ”.
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ gender. ”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with unambiguous genitals.
New-born are no longer assigned rigirigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare sex for such children, but can “ undefined ” or “ unspecified ” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to take overhasty decisions on gender allocation operations for newborn children and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
As the BBC said, an intersexual person said, “ I am neither man nor woman. ”
I remain the patchwork, which has been created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children is born neither as a young boy nor as a girl every year.
They are among the intersexual, a group diagnosed as “ sexual differentiation problems ” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chmomosomes, germinglands (ovaries) or undeveloped genitital.
Wallis Simpson may well have been intersexual.
Understanding of gender identification is still not well developed, but most US experts in the US advise to use the best information available for gender allocation if a provision is not possible and not wait for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding, if any, to do surgery.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, specializing in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law “ blade after a good thing. ”
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“ Some people have life-threatening illnesses that make surgical intervention necessary, but this does not apply to most children, ” he said.
You can perform gender allocation without an operation and then see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his sexual identity at all is not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it is happening.
It is like the secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission stipules that intersexual people should be distinguishable from transsexual or transgender persons because their status is not gender related but due to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were reflected in subordinate sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hairs ing, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination against intersexual and transgender persons in professional life as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice criminality.
Young boys who do not match the gender image now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or “ third gender ” on official documents.
In June, Australians Norrie May-Welby (52) were recognized as the world ’ s first “ gendered ” person after a court had granted the lifetime retention of “ unspecified ” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German identity cards will, in the future, have a third allocation, X for intersexually, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books.
The US Web site Catholic Online has also spoken against German law on the grounds: “ If the world is drawn into a new state, where gender is a decision but not sexual sexual activity, we are twisting two more pillars of civilization. ”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told to baby zone that she felt that it would be better for babies to be assigned a sex at birth.
“ Parental dasis already stresstressful enough even without further restrictions, especially if you don ’ t know your own child ’ s sex, ” said the parents ’ website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both both male and female sex parts were described as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Only ten years ago, medicine considered the gender to be something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But the basic ethical foundations of an operation are now questioned, since we now know how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can be wrong because they do not know how the child feels growing up with the sex they allocate.
“ In the middle of the 20th century it was called a psychiatric emergency, ” said Drescher.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The dominant theory about the treatment of children with unambiguous genitals dates back to John John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that sex is formable.
He coined the term “ gender identity, ” arguing that social and environmental incentives – as the parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones, and defining whether a person sees himself as male or female.
However, in a case known under the title “ John / Joan ” in 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penpenis had been separated in a pledged circumcision, to caate the child completely and to remove remove his testicles and then raise him up as girls.
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion, but it was not, ” Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practise this model.
But in the 1990 ’ s, with the Internet, survivors out of these gender operations came to the public, who are “ not happy with the result. ”
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36 year old author from Montana who was born with XY-male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitortoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man.
So, shortly after the birth of 1976, his external organ and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
“ I knew I was not a girl, ” he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive vaginal plastics.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and nobody has ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD where his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals.
After learning the truth, he moved back to male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation made it infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to ensure that intersexual people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, CEO of Californi-based Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that German law can “ help stamp and stigmmatize. ”
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision may encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign,, not fixed, to the child, ” she said.
We fear this encourages intervention.
We think it would be better to allocate the male or female sex and then to wait.
However, we do not yet know what effect the law will have, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, because “ it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender. ”
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex, ” she explained.
German law is about allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide for their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that German law “ fully powerful ” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSDD called complete Androgen resistance.
Katie developed female characteristics due to the receptor defective of the target cells for testosterone.
It has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie Katie married married working at the University of Pennsylvania, sylvania as working a child psychiatriry atric worker. She was born in K, sylv, and is working at the University of Pennsylvania.
It is infertile, but hopes to have a child through adoption or surrogate mother.
“ The law gives parents room for not having to make hasty decisions, ” said Baratz.
It gives them the time to do different tests and to clarify things, giving them time before writing “ male ” or “ female. ”
In this way, everything is fine – you pull the child big and you love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parents' happiness.
And you do not need to haste an operation that cannot be undone.
“ This includes the children in the decision and removes the fear that drives parents because they think they are not doing the right thing, ” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides the sex that suits better – and that is wonderful.
This puts children in a position to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injure girls by shooting from car
Unknown have injured a Twelve year old in the case of shots from a car in Saxony-Anhalt.
The perpetrators had probably fired on a group of children on Thursday evening with an air pressure weapon.
The police told the castle.
The girl was easily injured on the left wade.
They brought the girl to hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and suddenly stopped there.
witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc collapsed.
Subsequently, they drove of it.
The criminal police investigated, it was said on Friday.
To this stage the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were only called twice to ggling children who threw them against house facades.
Since house owners recognized this in time and the eggs immediately removed it, no material damage should also have occurred.
In addition, some of Sylvesterböller were ignited, but there was no material damage to the area.
A resident in the Bishop Friendship Path reported that his car was wrapped in with cloppaper and his cyclists bliners were stolen.
Until the police police police arrived, the man refound his cycle blades in the immediate vicinity of however, so the police did not have to go further.
Future lodging
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives fantastically.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green, an old tree, nice neighbour and not too much traffic.
It is only a few minutes by public transport.
" Hopefully you are not afraid of spiders? " asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spspider phobia, but the concern that in old age no longer to cope with the many stairways to the house and in the apartment.
Moreover, since a Meniskus operation, the mid-fifties has had to know for herself what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Only recently, a book was published on the subject of' Happily living in old age - What form of residence is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age' begins to tell her.
When she moved to the maisonette apartment with her husband over 20 years ago, it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of greenery.
Today with mid-fifty Waltraud Ries thinks it differently.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people to deal with the issue of living at old age.
Most of them are displacing it as long as it is possible.
Old always become only others,' says she smiling.
Only when the suffering pressure is really great can there be thought.
'Then it can be too late', says Ries.
In her book the interior designer presents 17 living models for a self-determined living in old age.
" What type of residence you choose, however, is always an individual decision, " she explains.
D i e solution does not exist for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement pension in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also become ill.
And:' Without good knowledge of the local language you can unite also in Dolce Vita,' gives the specialist book author to consider willing to settle.
Among their models there find classic care models, alternative forms of living, or often-cited pensionner-WG.
In old age, everyone has their own Ticks and icks.
" For me, such a residential community would be nothing ", says with an eytwink.
Not at all as in a student WG with a shared bath and a kitchen.
'At old age you simply need your retreat rooms', says Ries.
The book author does not want to exclude the fact that a senior residential community can nevertheless work.
However, this had to be different from that in the classic Studenten-WG.
And sometimes you just want your rest', she believes.
It is not alone in this opinion, at least in the national capital.
'The most old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as goes in their own home' is also the experience of Theresa esa Rütten, the manager of citizen services life at the age of the state capital.
Your office advises people around the subject of' becoming elderly'.
That is why the elderly people in particular would often accept inconvenience and restrictions in order to be able to stay in their familiar environment, that is the experience of the Foundation Warentest est.
Today there are many ways to make the house or the apartment easily accessible.
Ries recommends that those who are concerned with altering their home or their apartment according to age age to obtain detailed information and not to hire the best craftsmen.
Today there are also specialists for age alterations.
Even in the rental apartment, one or two can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
But the existing apartment cannot always be adapted to the age and thus barrier-free, even however beautiful beautiful it is.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the also paved stastairway to the apartment door would be a much greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving move, she is more gray of her than before the spider at her home door.
The US wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its attitude towards former US intelligence worker Edward Snowden.
He continues to be accused of passing on unauthorised secret information.
So he had to face criminal proceedings in the US, said the US State Department spokeswoman, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Nor would Snowden ’ s recent statements do anything to change this.
Before that, German green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the US after a meeting Snowden den Moscow not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele statements were those of a parliamentarian, not those of a member of the German government.
Intelligence Service thriller Edward Snowden is generally prepared to hold talks with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to have his situation clarified.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought for by the USA in an unaddressed letter that the Green politician Hans-Christian Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and passed it to the Federal Government, Bundestag and the Federal Federal General.
The letter has the following wording, following a translation widely used by Ströbele:
To the responsible
I have been asked to write to you about your inquiry into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was previously contraccontract or direct employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
During my work in these institutions, I witnessed systematic breaches of law by my government, which prompted me from a moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I found myself exposed to serious and persistent grievles which forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance to my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials - including the United States - have regarded the revelations about a system of all-inclusive surveillance that will not be accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These sppionage revelations produced many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously covert abuse of public confidence.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clearer; at the same time, the risks taken were visibly reduced.
Although the results of my endeavours have been demonstrably positive, my government still treats dissent as a ruthof trust and strives to criminalise and proseccharges of political expression.
Yet telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this damaging attitude.
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and by law in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to talking with you in your country, once the situation has been clarified and I thank you for your efforts to uphold international law, which protects us all.

Kindergarten found a Private Buyer
" The building is in good hands, " says Winterlingens mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the Gartenstraße was sold to a private person.
The Municipal Council agreed to the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to " reasonable " price.
" The commune is satisfied, " emphasizes Maier.
EUR 100 000 has been set aside in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter, so they no longer have to pay for the entertainment of the house how to heat, look for the garden, and clear the walking way.
" This effort is now gone, " Maier is delighted.

Report: Obama campaign thought about replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, “ Double Down: Game Change 2012. ”
The Times has a copy of the book to be released and reported on Thursday evening that the president's top advisers had held “ large-scale group meetings and polls at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether Obama ’ s falling hope of re-election better to drop bides.
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times national policy correspondent, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of senior staff of the campaign campaign and White House, notably the former White White White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on polls numbers exchange former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly kept secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest closest advisors – including Daley, Obama ’ s former head of the campaign campaign, Jim Messina, and the former White House advisor, David David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the change of change.
“ Double Down ” claims that Daley was at the head of efforts to exchange bides despite her “ narrow personal personal relations, ” before finally deciding against such a move after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy would not significantly improve Obama Obama ’ s chances. ”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“ I said a lot of things to consider and that was one of them, ” Daley told the magazine.
One must remember that the president had terrible poll numbers at that time, so we thought: “ For God God's will, what do we do? ”
While Daley described the investigations as “ due diligence, ” Martin said to CNN Cooper of Anderson that considerable effort had been put into it during the re-election campaign to determine whether such a train pays off in the ballot boxes.
“ In campaigns, not so much of money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t think seriously about something, ” said Martin Martin on AC360.
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his former boss had been informed about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” the possible change, the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew of it.
Martin added that “ Double Down ” did not provide a definitive answer to whether the political probations have reached Obama ’ s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama Obama knew nothing about investigations into whether to drop bids in the elections.
“ Possible, ” Martin replied.
What happens to my email on the way?
After all, e-mail is actually an electronic letter.
In the design of the Internet service, was mail secrecy technically technically similar to that used in conventional mail mail?
The focus of the conception of early Internet services was to make communication possible.
That is why the basic technical protocols protocols have not taken care to create a stable foundation for a hear-safe exchange of correspondence.
Therefore, a traditional email is more an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If the user " Anna " sends an email to " Benni ", are the computers of the two then directly connected?
The first step, Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if it has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the route the mail can run over a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to its provider.
Will traditional e-mails be read on their way through the net?
Most mails are read several times by software robots along the way.
The sender provider usually checks whether the mail contains a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check will also be carried out on the receiver systems.
The service providers also check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
On systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display links to holiday offers.
Even unknown people read the e-mails?
The probability of unauthorized persons reading an email is very low.
In theory, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
In addition to this there are possible illegal spspying operations.
Is it possible to protect emails against reading?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against co-reading.
With a high technical effort it is also possible to conceal the metadadata of email communication, so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
According to an investigation by Convios Consulting in August 2013, Yahoo and Google play a subordinate role in the mailboxes used mainly for private use.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had last fallen, GMail was able to increase significantly from Google.
Mother in the forest and collect pensions
When his mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He committed the deaths in a forest and continued to collect their pension and allowance.
In order to be able to collect pension and care fees, a 67-year-old Wolfsburg has buried his dead mother after police police investigations in the forest.
First, he covered up the death death of the 89-year-old, then he lost the money for more than a year and a half.
Now, the person of the 67-year-old will have to answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
As a result, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected in May: it was apparent that no more medicines were needed for the mother in need care.
The investigators told the pensioner that his mother had gone to Spain.
Because officials found this strange, they continued to determine.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and had last cultivfor it.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, obduction showed no evidence of capital crime.
Do you want an ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur developed the first shining ice in the dark – with torture.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine life and turned into a bright spmile from shop.
The idea came to him after he had read research into scales and persuaded Chinese scientists to artificial produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, raising the pH value in the protein and causing the luminaire.
Chris explains that the ice will react to the heat in the mouth and shine – so the more one licks, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “ Lick ick Me m Delicious, ” says “ The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds. ”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value will rise and the ice glows up.
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to us to launch it at Halloween, because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made because the crystal luminaire is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it is delicious for that.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to become more ambitious.
He says, “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream. ”
This is impossible in itself, because of the break of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I suspect that we will find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a quall artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
After six days of matches, TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball league.
It is just now that the Ingo Ehhlers team will join tomorrow Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season begins for us.
" I hope we have got our heads free, " gives Ehler's attitude more optimistic.
He has finally got his complete cader, with the exception of permanently injured injured Hendrik Blohme.
Daverden also counts as we do on tempo play.
We must therefore keep our error rate low.
However, the main thing is to increase the coverage, which has recently left anything but a safe impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is considerably more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that is why we are far from being the favourite, because in Derby everything can always happen.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to move in Morsum to start a series.
Absent becomes Jan-Malte Jodat.
The A-youths Joost Windßuss celebrates their season debut with the right of double double play at the A-Young Youth Bundesleague HC Bremen.
Whoever is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Figures
When I was small Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress up for the neighbourhood.
Today I have become a Halloween potato.
In the last two years I have not declared willing to distribute sweets from my home and I probably probably not do so this year.
But, according to the statistics, I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and decorations, according to the US Retailers Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will amount to about 1.2 billion of the USD 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inspirational unanimated objects are the last cry.
Women will no longer have to wrathemselves in sexy clothes, and they can now embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men I expect a lot of zombies with The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-punk space stars will make the instagram feed this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are Zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and to my surprise we were not alone.
Indeed, Americans are spending $330 million this year on pet costumes, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
With regard to sweets, we are not squeamy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, slips, sweets and rubber bears.
So good news news for the US Department of Commerce that there are 41 million people moving through the quarters with the phrase “ sweet or acid. ”
Indeed, we will buy over 40 million kilogram of chocolate for Halloween and – don ’ delude ourselves – eat.
The only thing we do not want to use is sugar-sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold by Halloween, according to the National confectionery Producers Association.
These are about nine billion corn grains.
It is a mystery that I have not been able to solve.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it spuks.
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” (which is in a real prison), “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock.
Indeed, there are 1,200 officially recognized spucchouses in the United States that earn $500 million earnings, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos you are ping into your pusers and then put friends on Facebook where you do not get rid of and then the type you stand leave a comment like “ nice face expression. ”
But let us come to the pumpkin.
Charlie Brown familiarius with the Great pumpkin when we were children, and carving of a pumpkin tree is like the decorative of the Christmas tree tree – something we have done from small.
Fortunately, the “ baby in pumpkin ” trend began only last year, thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up by spping down the pumpkin, rather than sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkin, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin, which are slowly rotting in the front yard, probably come from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and grab a little ck from their 921 kilos heavy pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmbrecht: rescue forces burnt corpses
The fire department had to leave in Helmbrechts late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire during the night to Friday.
The rescue forces collect an untreated corpse from the house.
Rescue forces found an untreated corpse in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is an inhabitant is still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday evening it burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames beaten out of a window.
The forces went to the apartment and found the corpse in a room.
This and another room burnt completely.
The ground floor was damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman explained.
The building is no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was initially not clear.
Germany ’ s largest state church has a Offenwinning artet to promote the pastor profession.
The background is a possible lack of pastors: the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hannover expects that after the current situation, the number of around 1,800 pastorors and pastors, will be halved by 2030.
For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily schedule.
For the first time, the State of State Church (((Church of State) has commissioned a pastpastor in a full place to inspire young people for the study of theology.
At the moment, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology.
Burfien attributed this to the process of desecration: " God's voice is quiet, the world is loud ".
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my calendar and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors, as sailors, could be very close to the people.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well on it.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer.
This will accommodate today ’ s young people who are not just about a career, but about hard work.
According to the State Church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring per year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates from a theology course start their Vikariat.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may become difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offered a broad education.
You can even become President.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interior consists of race seats and six-point belts as well as a free intercom system.
The options range from increased brakes, a package of services with support for Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport explains: “ Rally customers coming to Bowler have changed. ”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventures as well as for an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to open this path in partnership both with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the stress and reality of Rally Raid.
We really really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship.
Furthermore, there is a training and test day in February at the DefDefender Challenge as well as the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called to rescue rescue a dog that was ched 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock edge in a quarry.
Cockerspaniel-female Ruby ran away after a minor traffic accident.
Three days later, it was badly discovered by a walker in the quarry.
Firefighters ran on the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death.
The fire brigade managed to put a dog into safety that was stuck on a 15 meter high high lead in a rock wall.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-bitch Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his boyfriend Becky Hall, 20 to whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to welcome Ruby again and thanks to the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They desperdesperately sought her missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when she had out into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
About about 14: 15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker who performed his dog saw the stranded Ruby sitting on the 15 metre high paragraph in the quarry.
The technical rescue team at Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed and and went down to rescue Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “ She was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen.
But now she is doing well.
She then eaten a few dog cakes.
This was quite unusual.
The fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, the specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “ Ruby had a giant fortune. ”
There was a possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was examined as a veterinary surgeon but did not detect anything other than exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire said, “ watching the rescue was frightening. ”
I could not believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back in the arms.
The veterinarian said that if exhaustion had become too large and it had collapsed, it would probably have been collapashed.
The fire-fighters have done a great job.
It was really brave to do what they did.
We are simply so grateful, and each of them was absolutely unbelievable.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added: “ We were afraid that she would fall down but she stayed up. ”
The fire-fighters were great.
I can hardly believe where it was.
Mick Jagger explained that he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song Old Habits The Hard from 2004.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the altrocker, and that “ he greached me when I was 18. ”
She added: “ That has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me. ”
In a statement a representative Jagger, at 70 said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he had ever attempted to approach to Katy Perry ”.
The representative added “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album “ Prism ” landed at number 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots
A new day, a new horror horror about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This is the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the Hadrian wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the potential for economic benefits that would increase freedom to travel in the whole rest of Europe, but, as expected, this played no part in the headlines.
Nor has nobody mentioned that the EU member states often turn their way around their strict rules if it is more convenient for them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen Schengen area, continued non-respect for the Brussels would be a small concession in exchange for what they really want from Scots.
So it is not really a story.
And one that has come so in the years that it already resemblike a fossil: the first time I heard the “ Independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago.
In fact, an interesting point is being lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance according to the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan for unifying Europe has come to a halt.
The European project officially died as a result of the euro crisis.
All over the EU, parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or to throw aside the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Alternative Alternative Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to win just under five million votes in the Bundestelection in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket into which each national economy is forced to maintain the single currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro ’ s crisis has little to do with national governments creating excessive budget deficits – that was the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has stuck its members stuck to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to do so.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, southern Europe finds itself at a built-in productivity disadvantage in comparison to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems there is a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the “ green ” energy policies imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling part of the cost, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage fixations in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into a corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt, especially in France, is the EU's former cheerleader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and raise Paris on equal terms with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and has imposed Europe its own economic policy, with which the failing French economy is struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive post-election, thereby pointing ting the ruling socialists to number three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a very timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split on the right would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to take advantage of the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is very possible – then for the first time such a bloblock could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together for the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something like the “ Europe of (sovereign) nations ” that General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering up with the United States.
But Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be alone in Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland with all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (in final consequence) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can hide where.
I suspect that Scotland could go well in a looser European union, if we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing Norway the same and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – noteably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe, and won a spectacular majority in 2011 through the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts brought for by Labour Finance Minister Alistair DarDarling and the successive Tory-Lib Demcoalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now only to get a policy of austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: grow up quicker
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age colleagues, as studies show.
Physical changes do not yet directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty.
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys.
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialized in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grows breasts and shamhahair at the age of seven or eight years of age?
At the annual Pediatrics Association American Academy of Pediediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, paediatric Endorinologist, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, explained that these early corporphysical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – this is usually no sign that puberty is happening fast, ” Kaplowitz explained.
Obviously vious indications of development, such as growing breasts, shameful and axle hair and body odour, are seen earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (occurrence of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“ When the development of breasts begins it takes at least two to three years until Menarche ” said Kaplowitz, author of the book “ Early puberty for girls: the essential guide for dealing with this frequent problem ”.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is progressing.
It is controversial about what is actually the beginning of the puberty, but it is “ premature ” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a stroke of growth before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows or stagnates – something that a paediatrician can monitor closely.
If progress goes faster, tests could be displayed by an Endicronologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors, tumors or cycsts.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstrustrustruation and preventing another consequence: the premature ageing of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth of growth and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are geared on the child's age, development speed, rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: “ suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings of being different to their old colleagues. ”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
“ They are concerned about pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side, ” said Kaplowitz.
“ It was a shock, ” remembers a woman whose daughter was given her days at age of ten ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstrustruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came frightened and excited home from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones are produced in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
The boys come to puberty earlier like the girls.
Kaplowitz believes that the most persuasive premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which establishes a link between body fat and entry to puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age peates.
There are different explanations.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzles: Although young people are growing facial and shamamy in the past, the trend towards full-fledged earlier puberty is not as pronounced as that of girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and shamhair is common among babies and young children.
“ We need to be careful about how we identify the true beginning of puberty, ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to let their paediatrician advise how they should talk to their child.
“ This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected, ” riets Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it was previously intended.
Jumo manufacturers argue about seat width in the face of large orders.
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, which sets the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats offered to passengers on flights in the tourist class long – not always those for which airlines are making the greatest effort, but this designated space is the key key to the claims of efficiency of the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS eing eing eing Co.
This week, Airbus called for an industry standard with a width of at least 46 cm (18 inch) in the tourist class, but the American arch rival BoBoeing eing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even more larger versions of their two-engine haul hauters and expect record order orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic outcomes that the new “ mini-Jumbo ” design should deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 777X ” covers 406 people at seats in the tourist class, which are more than 17 ches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus states that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 passengers in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often divide blows over technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 7777X is expected to start the race with more than 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertising war, and donors presented a picture in which three people squsqueezed in a restaurant, with the title: “ Would you accept it? ”
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props, ” says Airbus sales director John Leahy.
Faced with changing eating habits, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970 ’ s, when Boeing 7747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century the weight of the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 has increased by 10%, according to the US Department of Health data.
The waist of the average male American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to US health statistics.
Airbus says that its rival adhered to a 1950s seating concept when the average body range of the freshly ristened jet set was narrowing.
Airbus says, Airbus has carried out studies showing that an extra inch (2.54 cm) increases the quality of sleep by 53 percent per seat.
Boeing denies Airbus Airbus figures on seat sizes and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines strike the balance between fares and facilities.
The company also explains that according to studies, the experience on the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
“ It really comes down to providing airlines with flexibility so that they can do what they believe necessary in order to be successful, ” explains BoBoeing ’ s cabin cabin expert Kent Bover.
They do not want us to dictate to them, which makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that may affect sales.
Behind the controversy there is an estimated race for aircraft orders of at least $700 billion at list prices over the next few decades, with a lasting impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing ’ s statements about the results depend partly on the fact that the 7777X is compared to its ten seats per row to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per line.
“ Boeing therefore squeezes more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products, ” says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats at existing 7777s indicated that many passengers passengers opted for tighter, which could result with cheaper fares.
“ Eighteen inch seat width would be great for passengers, the reality is: from an economic perspective the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 7777, ” Mary Mary Kirby, a cabin equipment expert, the founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world travel jet vendellers even carry bandmeasurements to measure the set-up in the competition.
Even if they promote the comfort, all the manufacturers also offer jets with condensed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seated rows, but according to its own statement it has not sold sold one.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of increasing adaptability of cabins and offered some jets wide seats on the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably faish but could distract the wave of 7777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could kill off the pleasure of smoking.
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil fun smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction.
Further tests tests are needed before humans, which may take take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill CornCornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good.
“ We are hopeful that this type of vaccvaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, tried all the methods available on the market, but have seen their nicotine addiction stronger than these approaches, ” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus modified to contain genetic information on production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a permanent stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
mice without vaccination, on the other hand would have taken a “ time out, ” the researchers explained, a sign that nicotine has reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the Journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed, because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower because it turns liver cells into antivirus factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if certain, could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
It is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“ They then know: if they start smoking again, they will no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine and this helps them break the habit, ” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that there was a need for further research.
Tripodi denied being influenced by Obeid
An investigation is being carried out into corruption corruption against the former former minister of the South Wales party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales.
The former NSW minister conties having changed the rules on maritime leasing at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden holdings in three land in state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Commission Against Corruption) extended its investigations on Friday into whether Obeid influenced various state ministers to extend rental contracts at Circular Quay ay where Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without calling for tender after they expired in August 2005.
Now it is being investigated for the allegation that Tripodi was aware of Obeid's concealed interest in the land, after Tripodi's former senior deputy staff, Lynne Ashpole, said so on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for lerent contracts.
The countenants were against it and also wanted longer running times.
In 2009, lease contracts for the Circular Quay companies that contributed $2.5 million a year to Obeids were extended without any call for public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Port from February 2006 to November 2009, originally voted in favour of public tenders.
But he contested to have made changes at the request of Obeid who, as TriTripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reorganization of government lease rules.
One of the telephone papers submitted to the ICAC showed talks in August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Ministry of port after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
“ Was the issue raised in these telephone talks the elaborof of commercial leasing arrangements? ” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“ No, ” Tripodi replied.
I cannot remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes attack targets in Syria, so official sources
Israeli fighter aircraft would have attacked Thursday night in the Syrian port of Latakia, confirmed by a senior government employee to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the aim was, but said that it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA 125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile deliveries to Syria.
Foreign workers with 457-visas could be tested “ Echtheit. ”
The government is considering a “ Echthei” test test for foreign workers with 457-visa through expanded measures.
If the test were be introduced, it would be used by a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government proposal for discussion was published after the former members of the Laboratory Party, Maxine McMcKew, condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers because they could perceived as an insult by Australia ’ s neighbours.
“ Louong declarations like that foreigners should stand behind, ” and “ hire Australian first ” are a very pleasant backward step in times when trade unions demanded a sheltered labor market, ” said the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region were to catch an echo of this historical artifact, it would not surprise me.
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures once thought vised by the former minister of immigration, Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O O'Connor, who was yesterday to talks on human smuggling in Sri Lanka, implemented five of the recommended changes, while others are still under consideration.
If the “ authenticity ity criterion ” is adopted, someone applying for a visa visa could be checked to whether “ the application is genuine in those cases in which the applicant is related or personally related to the holder or a relevant person person of the supportive company. ”
Businesses could also be obliged to account for the number of 457-visa holders after, in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seekprobably died of a heart attack after he arrived on the Christmas Island earlier this week with a refugee boat.
The troubled nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been taken after ed by an adult ccousin since the death of his father on Wednesday, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man to Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The British Government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes that high-speed high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England should be implemented from the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project ‘ will bring Britain closer together ’.
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high speed road between London and Northern England, from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacities and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility to travel for three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together. ”
We are going ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it we face a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “ Today's announcement is good news for Scotland. ”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown asked Carmichael to be “ unequivocal ” for Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: “ The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic power provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK. ”
Therefore, we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and examine the options available for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding the next steps.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force for now in Australia
Australian passengers must continue to shut off tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, see or play videos on their devices if they are in “ flight mode ” during critical flight flight phases.
Passengers are already allowed to do so most of the flight find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when starting and landing.
Australian companies are observing decision, which US airlines have to do a lot of work to implement, but have no immediate plans to change their rules.
The air traffic control agency CASA ASA also stated that it will look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices continue to apply in critical flight phases in Australia.
“ CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in aircraft, ” has been announced.
The issue is subject to provisions whereby airlines maintain safety at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by cabin staff.
Virgin has already talked with CASA ASA about expanding the use of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and said they are open to changes, but they must be initiated by the legislators.
“ We would welcome a review of CASA's approval of electronic devices, because we convinced that this would improve the customer experience, after now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight, ” a speaker said.
Qantas said that they will stick to the current rules for the time being.
“ Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices may not be used during startuand landing, and we currently have no plans to change this, ” the company said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and we certainly will look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons for this.
The decision will have a different impact on American companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disruption through mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs, and customer instruction.
“ After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers, and smartphones of any height, ” the FAA announced.
In rare cases, with bad visibility, the crew will advise passengers to switch off the equipment while landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
In front of the Rederraid against Schalke, travelling BVB trailers with light missiles had caused ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost frightening acoustic that in the Iduna Park until just before the start of the German Bundesliga match.
The majority of them were the guests with their choirs.
The southern gallery, on the contrary, where the most faifaithful - and loudest - of BVB fans are, at the beginning presented itself extraordinarily quiet: no chants, no cry for battle.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common approach, remained vacant.
And at the front of the grandstand there was lonely a big flag with the " Bon stadium stadium " section.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller entered the place as BVB first BVB player, short-term jubsparked.
When his team colleagues followed, there were strong vocal voices and wringling scarves - but far from everywhere.
There was nothing excitation in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern gallery.
Also, that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel re-listed the positive experiences of recent days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a holiday mood.
Only five minutes before the knock off the Capo clapped its podial - and the tension that could then be reached with hands hands unleashed in a loud screry when Dickel always asked for the mood on the ranks of the stadium.
The last turn, as usual, was the southern gallery - and finally this was the loudest place in the stadium as usual.
And at the latest when Anpfiff from the South came the loud call " Derbysieger stands up ", everything again was as usual.
The silence before was probably a response to what has happened in recent days.
Right before the ReSchalke 04 04 FC Schalke 04 some of the BVB trailers fired lights into the audience and the - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke then received the heads of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement, " the BVB Boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure Watzke prohibid the Ultras a choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.
" I banned this, " he explained.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnology.
The Ultras have also been shown various ways of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, Watzke says the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
" This will be cutting ", insured Watzke.
We are wait to see what the reactions in the southern gallery will then be.
Pfandhäuser booming in Singapore, with the middle class crisis
In a Pfandhaus in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanged a golden armearp, a ring and a pair of earrings in order to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“ My husband and I have just bought a house, where all my money money is there, ” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earned 3,000 dollars per month month (about EUR 1,730) as an administrative worker and also employed her husband, the monthly family income per month is not sufficient, she explains.
Indeed, parts of SouSoutheast Asia – where household indebtedness increases – is so high that ValueMax, where it has made its exchange, has become the third Pfandhaus listed on the Singaporurian stock exchange this week.
pledging jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore in the case of Jananani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an insecure bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhäuser in Singapore demand an effective annual rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
Pfandhäuser offer the advantage that there is no verification of creditworthinthiness or proof of income, which is why loans are possible more quickly than at banks.
This is why millions of people in the region turn to Pfandhäuser after families feel the pressure brought by the rising cost of living, as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to loose financial policies in advanced economies, lower- and middle-income income families are looking for Pfandhouses to offset the difference with stmbling economy.
This week, the rating agency described Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditedness of Asian banks.
According to the Agency estimates, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is the top of the list with 80% of GDP, which with a 60% increase in 2008.
National economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which emerged emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
“ In the end, this means that, as costs rise, mimiddle-to lower people (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible, ” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the last two years have reinforced the trend to pledge personal objects, as people take the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of items packaged in the city state's 200 deposit houses are gold.
People tell themselves: “ The gold price looks good, let us pledge grandmother ’ s gold chain and bring back next month. ”
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% increase in customers in its stores last few months.
Pfandgrowth is so strong that ValueMax Group, the branch operator in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says ValuValueMax Managing Director Yeah Lee Ching.
The company finances this at 60% of the Singapore Singapore $66 million that it received with the IPO in Singapore this week.
While some lenders have entered the crossfire for high interest rates, Yeah explains that Pfandhouses not only offer lower interest rates than other lenders, but do not increase debt directly.
“ Customers borrow objects that they already own and the liquidation of personal items of ables does not increase their household debt, ” she explains.
The Pfandloan business is increasingly socially accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Nor are not all people who use mortgage loans in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax ’ s stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex ex watches, where they get up to 60% of the purchase price in cash.
We are made up of clients from every social class.
“ This includes wealthy borrowing something for business or investment in the short term, or small businesses that have to bridge cash flow bottlenecks, ” says Yeah.
Sometimes they simply need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help.
Edward Snowden, Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany understand the increasingly brislate NSA cases.
According to the green-Bundestestag Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-secret service employee would speak to a German public prosecutor or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden pointed to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine " Panorama ".
Bailout over $325 million Australian Tasmanic Health Bail
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions attached to the bailout package of more than $325 million million for Tasmanic health care in order to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate measures ” to avert crisis caused by an ageing population in the island state, a higher rate of chronic chronic diseases and systemic restraints.
Funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanic deputy Andrew Wilkie.
“ The government has prepared an emergency emergency rescue package that, in our view, addresses the unique challenges faced by federal state, ” PPlibersek said.
The $35-million package includes $31 million in emergency election aid.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments due to grey star, are intended to eliminate residues.
Moreover, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after stationary stays, specialist medical training, mental health services, and the introduction of an electronic record of health data in local hospitals.
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that affected hospital workers told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanic health system, ” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanic government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional money was spent.
A three-headed commission will be set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would serve little use if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmanic health system on a more sustainable course. ”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance that he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state ’ s public health system off the worry list, ” Wilkie said.
According to the federal government, these elections will largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But the federal health spokesman for the opposition, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is “ a pavement solution. ”
“ We are in today ’ s position because the laboratory state government has pulled $430 million out of health care system, ” he said to ABC TV.
It is unacceptable for a state government to tear almost half a billion dollars from the system, put 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretend that this is good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, such as a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for producing chemical weapons and nitite gas ammunition, declared the global Monitoring Group on ChemWeapons on Thursday Thursday, with serious clashes in the north of the country near one of the sites where alleged toxic substances are being stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people were killed since the beginning of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for prohibiting chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date.
1 November, which Damasascus, based in The Hague, had set up to destroy all facilities for producing chemical weapons or make them ‘ inoperable ’, including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and the filling of ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, must start destroying existing weapons and supplies.
It is assumptions that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday when experts experts say that there is a chemical weapons production facility storage facilities, as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group persecuting the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria declared on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these are 61,067 civilians, including 6.365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them were to President Bashar Assad's army; 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Among the dead there were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This figure has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee from the country.
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels for weeks in Safira, many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups.
The Centre said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday but did not mention details.
The fighting underscore the danger faced to chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission mission to free Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team is “ now convinced that it has seen all the major production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria and that it has witnessed their destruction. ”
Therefore, “ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment. ”
Earlier this week, the inspectors declared they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus.
Due to safety concerns, it has not been possible to visit two facilities, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPWC declared that according to Syrian statement, the two sites had “ been abandoned... and existing objects in the chemical weapons weapons programme had been moved to other facilities facilities which have been inspected. ”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC executive committee next month.
“ I salute for the bravery and courage that you have all shown in carrying out the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization, ” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the monitoring organisation, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels involved in this civil war against Assad ’ s government and their security forces, including members of the Alawites, are fighting a secession from Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he explained.
Anrage at the Bali Bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the bombing in Bali in 2002 were angry about the sentence for the last of the initiators to be brought to justice, because they believed Umar Patek should be shot under civil law.
Patek, who was one of the most sought flerefugees from Southeast Asia for less than ten years, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for his role in the construction of explosive bodies for the bombing attack.
With penalty suspension he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old boy was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two night clubs in the most popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A was also found in a series of terrorism-related charges, which included a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The public prosecutor ’ s office had demanded a life sentence, even if it could apply for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a masterful bomber, is also called “ demoolition man..
The decision evoked painful memories at June of Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin brothers Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-changers almost ten years ago.
Coming with tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow the footsteps of the other guys.
“ He should be put in front of a shooting commando, ” Corteen said to AAP.
I have to live every day that I will not get any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughghters.
The Sari Club was put to the ground when on 12 October 2002 shortly after 11 p.m., a massive bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber let a explosives filled with explosives explode.
He fell into the coma for a month after the attack, and “ died ” three times while he hanged on a life preservation system.
Hughes said that Patek earned the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah Amrozi, Mukhlas, and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.
Really, this type should be given the death penalty before everyone else.
To keep him alive, there is no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be in court.
He withdrew almost a decade of arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad where, almost four months later, US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief, Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent commted that intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in order to rebuild the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
“ He didn ’ t stand up, ” said Corteen.
Until recently, he showed no reprets about how much suffering he inflicted on others.
The judgment came before the ten-year anniversary anniversary of this year's attack with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
“ There will be many tears this year, ” said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on aircraft (but no mobile phone calls)
From departure up to landing, passengers will now be able to listen to their electronic travel equipment reading, reading,, playing, music and use the reputation of films, but not call them on a mobile phone, according to the new guidelines issued out by the US Federal Aviation Administration Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depended on the airline airline explained by FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAFAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated flight crew' training manuals and regulations for stopping equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon, ” the FAA announced in a announcement.
At present, passengers must switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They can only start them again when the plane reaches an altitude of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
On entering the landing flight passengers passengers have to switch them off again and must not start again before the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic disruption could allow passengers to use the equipment when taking off, landing and on the field, explained FAFAA.
Most of the new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that were converted for the use of Wi-Fi at higher heights should comply with the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of professional cabin attendants, welcomed the changes.
“ If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline on this – both sides will benefit from it, ” said Glading.
To be honest, we are tired of feeling like watchdogs on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails text messages, or downloading data under three kilometres continued to be banned, as explained by the Authority.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no Words ds With Friends, Scrabble online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smphone 2011 when he left a jet from American Airlines because he refused to switch it off while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops must continue to be stolen, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile conversations during the flight will continue to be banned as well.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic devices when starting and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, safety expert on national traffic issues on CBS News, said that mobile phone phones are still considered a risk.
“ Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disturruptions in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can disrupt transmitting masts, ” says RosenRosenker.
A industry Advisory committee set up by the FAFAFAA to examine this issue last month recommended that the government should authorise a wider use of personal electronic equipment.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of equipment has become omnipresent.
Some studies mention the fact that up to one-third of passengers forgets or ignores the shutdown of the device.
In 1966 A FAA began limiting the use of the electronic devices by air passengers after reports of reports of disturruptions of navigation and communication devices through UKW radios carried led by passengers, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed in such a way approved by the FAA that they do not make anything to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude has been reached.
The planes adapted to wifi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today ’ s electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when you switch.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Those who advocate relaxation of passenger restrictions on the use of equipment include Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but none could them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the disruption of the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only isolated reports from pilots who are in favour of equipment disruption to aircraft systems and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended to the FAA to allow pilots to arrange for aircraft to be switched off in the case of instrument landing under poor visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adjustment for travellers who are now fully equipped with technology.
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety, ” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
rescued bird bird released by air rescue service from the North Sea rig.
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been exhausted on a riisland in the North North Sea, was released released into nature.
The water shed was flown to Aberdeen with a helicopter last month and was ped by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “ “ This shed was probably a wintry migratory bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea. ”
Apparently the exhausted bird was seeking refuge on the drilling island.
He added: “ He could not fly flying, so we were contacted with requests for help. ”
On her release the water rally was again fit and healthy.
Is Europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the aim of bringing the economy around the table and defining what those providing prosperity and work in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders and asking them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov questioned over 1,000 business executives depicting roughly the British corporate sizes, sectors, and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside Europe, concentrating on countries that are modernising and growing, while states in the EU are stagnating.
They want the government to favor new trade links with countries such as China, India, and Brazil rather than resstuck with the long and demanding process of reforming obscure EU institutions.
According to their view, when it comes to certain legally regulated issues – from antitel law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, because, according to companies, the cost of Brussels rules would outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trading zone – even 40% of large companies, which are traditionally the most pro-European, agreed.
Finally, and this is probably the most, our consultation with economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants to take a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This insight, found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the issue of action back to Britain.
It is a lot – a change to the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a 16% change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the British terms for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey shows, which means greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era.
The construction of the South Stream Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of the major European energy projects, explained the Gazproprom Board.
“ Today's event is a milestone: construction has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, ” ” said the Gazprom CEO, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the whole continent of Europe.
South Stream is to ensure greater diversity in Russia ’ s export routes through Europe.
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensures increased risk on conventional routes, as official officials say.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated forever forever.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project comes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries is expected to begin on the planned route to the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: two YMCA staff were charged before accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences.
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) have been accused of sex offences related to children, before accuscharges were made against child care Jonathan Lord, from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of children.
But, when making an opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA declared that “ had never had to do with an incident of sexual abuse in the organization. ”
Managing Director Phillip H. Hare was questioned a case in which a YMCA employee had been accused of offoffences of child pornography graphy, and another where a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted for abusing children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA ’ s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “ there were external checks by the YMCA recognized the YMCA to be at the forefront of child safety. ”
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed of receiving the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started 21 at YMCA, admitted that the management had “ failed from me me down ” to hire Lord Lord Lord and failed to ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report breaches of child safety directives.
Lord had been convicted of sexual offences earlier this year to twelve boys during his two-year career for the YMCA.
He has been sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argued that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented staff reporting Lords about breaches of child safety.
The staff said that they had observed breaches, including that Lord Lord Lord Lord alone with children, looked after private as a babysitter, let them sit on his lap, told them that he liked it, and let children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose mayor was Lord Lord, who requested training on child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnnat, who was Lords ords at YMCA Caringbah, was very intimidating and most of the time very imnear. ”
The CEO said that he would not accept statements from employees that they did not dare to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, it, her friendship with Lord affected her judgement, and so they would not have reported him.
Hare explained that he had told the board of the YMCA NSW that the “ lesson the organization had to draw from “ Jonathan-Lord ” incident ” did not concern reporting ” by employees, and the Management Board agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the accusations arooccurred had been taken by the Managing Director of the YMCA Children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this was to prevent contamination of the evidence, which has been ‘ over-zealous ’ and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not an organization safe for children at the time when Jonathan Lord Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, explained Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there had been “ serious problems ” in the recruitment, review, training, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said that he would take the opportunity to return as a British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-olds proclaimed their views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided expressing enting on British politics, and mostly limited his comments to foreign policy and his role as being the Quartet's Quartet peace envoy in the Middle East.
When asked whether he would like to return to the prime minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standing Standard in London: “ Yes, safe, but that is unlikely to happen, that is... ”
When the horse swing experts desced into shelves in Cardiff to cut the horse of the year, they were aware that tough competition was looming.
But none was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps which is not even in the kindergarten and took its first steps a few months ago, and its Shetland -Pony Toffee lackled through the three laps and won the first prize – leaving leaving behind 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable couple, both of equal size, has been praised for their occurrence, behaviour and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestriestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
While performing in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he set his plate cap in a cheek corner and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony, who would be far above his age.
Toffee ee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton received Toffee ee last March for his third birthday and since then practiced every day with the Shetland -Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30 said: “ Fenton and Toffee are a great man. ”
They had to compete against the whole field of participants and walked off the place with gold pophy and roRosette.
It was only the second time he participated in a competition with Toffee ee and we were all excited when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to photograph with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebw Vale, South Wales, follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has running horses for over ten years.
Howells said: “ The whole audience was electrielectrified and everyone fired and cloned him. ”
He ran on sand all entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he has done a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy for animals – he likes horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he looks after.
As it started, it will not take long to be on the “ horse of the year ” show – and I am sure it will do well.
An annual horse show spokesman said: “ Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony. ”
Together they are a great team.
The judges evaluated Fenton and Toffee ee for how well they had beaten themselves and presented in the show ring.
They ensure good cooperation between Pony and leader – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fentons's sweet clothes has helped their part to fit fit perfectly for the occasion.
The Chinese newspaper is called upon to be “ reformed. ”
A Chinese newspaper that had on the front page called for the release of a reporter accused of defamation was to be reformed, a press regulator explained.
The Guangzhou based New Express printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes in order to falsify reports about a sub-state company.
Now the New Express is undergoing “ comprehensive Rectification, ” the regulator explained.
The “ Rectification Order ” came from the Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the Neue Express, part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“ The New Express editorial management was disorderly, ” as the regulator announced in a statement.
She said she had decided “ to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and deprive him of reporting license. ”
It also instructed the Yangcheng's Evening News Group to undertake a complete review of the New Express, and recommended to identify the relevant persons responsible for the New Express and to immediately review the leadership team of the New Express. ”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for for payment.
“ In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the public ’ s confidence, ” he explained to the state news channel CCTV.
I did so in the first place because I was looking for money and fame.
I have realised that I have acted in the wrong way.
Following Chen's apology, the Neue Express published an apology on the front page and failed to review the reports properly.
Various well-known suspects have recently made confessions on the television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel with its own railway between the US and Mexico discovered
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the tunnel, measuring 120 times 90 centimetres as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found.
The tunnel, which runs in zickzag pattern over a length of almost six football pitches, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless unvisible storage warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drugs-loaded trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized, the authorities explained.
During the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tonnes of marihuana and 148 kilogram of cocaine had been secured, according to the records of the court.
Three men who, according to the authorities, were working as drivers have been indicted of the possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened with prison sentences between ten years and life in a guilty sentence.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of evaation channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the marihuana harvest in central mexiko in October, which poses the challenge to the drug cartels of how to bring their product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage with tracks nearly 640 meters long, which ran from a kitchen in a home in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to take separate paths in future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom commented about the separation of his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric that should be broadcast on Friday (local time) Bloom said, " sometimes life does not happen exactly as we plan or hope for ".
Kerr and he still loved himself, the 36-year-old emphasized.
" We will support each other and love each other as the parents of Flynn ".
Kerr and Bloom are married since 2010 and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to Lexika veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it is very different from it.
Because, while vegetarians afford to eat cream shorts, ice cream or a strong Edam, these delights are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the abandof meat and fish, the vegan abandjects all consumption of animal products, including honey and honey.
What remains, one may ask yourself, but on closer inspection, the vegane nutritional world is characterised by considerable ingenuity.
" Bread cuts are very popular, " explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house who offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store in the Domgasse.
For 13 years New Zealand native lives vegan, in Lampertheim he finds almost everything he needs to live.
At the turn of the century the next step was and I became a vegan.
" The conviction came not only because of nutrition, but because of the shoe choice, " says ProcProctor, who preferred art leather over normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost vegan is an ethics.
" I do not want animals have to die for me, " Proctor says the maxim of vegans, which covers all consumption behaviour.
Instead of dreuring burgers, stirreggs, or rubber bears, the vegan quickly rediscovered new products, with enthusiasm increased enthusiasm.
" It is a double bonus, " says Proctor today, " vegan does not represent renunci, not an esesese, it is an enrichment ".
And it is precisely these conditions that failed some even a well-intentioned attempt.
" The addictive factor is a crucial factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking, " Proctor makes a comparison.
And say:' certain tastes cannot be attached to the animal'.
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
" You can produce the same effect in a other way, " the vegan explains.
At a grill festival for example, Proctor brings auggplants, mushrooms and a few vegsausages.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, which should also have a good taste.
Of course you want to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate.
" It should taste, but this is not only reduced to animal food, " says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I do not take foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively on vegan.
" My blood values are excellent, I am often checked, " betrays Proctor.
In particular, many Vegansimuscritics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
" Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing in the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin--B12 is high in the meat bought in the cooling chest, " Proctor says.
For vegans it is possible to take the coenzenzym in the form of tablets.
" My B12 values are fine, " he explains.
Proctor should not go long distances for food procurement.
Basic food is available everywhere and every supermarket has soya milk and other products.
Everything I need can be found on the spot.
Only now and then I buy something special.
" Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but that is how what happens in the case of " ordinary " finished products ".
In any case preparing vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed.
" There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small keys you can achieve good if not partially better results, " says ProcProctor.
Margarine instead of butter, slightly more baking powder and carbon acid than egg, with his vegan cheese cakes, Proctor could astonsurprise his father-in-law.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
That is dynamic, if you cook together, it has a new significance.
" The situations that may arise are as different as people themselves, " Proctor says.
Of course, he has already been sceptical.
Does my food no longer please you?
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk? " - on such questions, you will have to act as sensitive vegans.
" I do not reject the people, I am part of this society, " Proctor does not want to run an enclavendasein.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as alien as suspected - and the vegan is not restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also permitted.
Pommes can be found everywhere!
" Many öner shops offer Falafel, or even a vegetarian Yufka, " says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he evades to pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow to adjust to this.
" When I started eating vvegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult ", the New New Zealand can find a development: " You have to talk to people and make them aware of it ".
" If enough questions come, they may be inclined to complement the menu, " he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the comedy in Mannheim or Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegane dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
" Meat dishes are exclusive in the truest sense of the word because they exclude others, " Proctor notes.
" If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible, " Proctor says.
However, buying vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
In particular, when you learn to understand that it can be a colouring in peannuts of animal additives, one seems to quickly abandon the courage by adhering to ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
This is not only why Reueuben Proctor Lars Thomsen wrote a book: " Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that food food and also detergents.
" Little by by little you develop a scanner view and know what characters and logos you have to watch, " It is sometimes better to take small steps than stopping or ststumble " says ProcProctor.
Vegeganism, it is an important moral finger that touches the consciousness.
He may not quite manage to abandon his habits, but at least he is able to teach consumers to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
Trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoons of German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of small and major failures with the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August this year, there were two failures in one week alone.
First, the US investment bank, Goldman Sachs, sent massively flawed purchase orders to option markets because of technical problems.
As a result, the stock exchange operators took almost a day to see and cancel the orders.
Two days later, half of total stock trading in the US came to a halt for several hours due to a computer breakdown at the Nasdaq stock exchange.
The Facebook IPO has also caused a stir last year.
The Nasdaq systems were not up to the flood of purchase and sales orders, later found stock exchange supervision SEC and diluted the company to a record fine of $10 million.

British Police are giving Assange an extradition notification
Today, the British police have handed over an extradition statement to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and sought asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australian had been presented with “ a call to face up ” ” asking him to appear in a police station, and added that if he failed, he threatened to face arrest.
Assange is threatened exextradition to Sweden for the charge in a sexsex offence after its possibilities under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected its appeal against extradition at the beginning of the month.
fearing that Stockholm would exover him to the United States, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has “ sent an invitation to a 40-year-old man to stand at a police guard at any time we choose, ” said a spokesman.
He continues to violate his release on bail.
The message made no comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears that he will be extradited to the United States by Sweden and charged for possible charges of spsppionage after having published over 250,000 diplomatic news on WikiLeaks website WikiLeaks.
Drivers who were ed with 210 km / h and a hot drink between their legs are given a penalty of £1,000.
A driver was imposed a penalty amounting to £1,000 because he had driven at up to 210 km / h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped with his Mercedes Benz on May 27 on the A120 near Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the beverage between his legs.
Howie declared himself guilty before the District Court of Colchester without having taken the necessary care and attention.
He was awarded seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a cost of £90 as well as a victim surcharge of £100.
Tax on foreign property owners against London ’ s speculative bubble
The Treasury Department has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but it is still waiting for the final decision of the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who imposed a 7% stamp in the 2012 budget on housing that cost over two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold housing as a company and not as individuals.
Already, revenues from stamp tax for housing in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which were £708 million in the 2012 13 tax year, exceed the proceeds for Northern Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire, and the Humber region combined.
Cook said, “ After the stamp tax increases on high-value housing and the introduction of associated legislation against circumasion, it is difficult to claim that high quality properties are too low taxed, regardless of the effects of the outdated local tax system. ”
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more restrained ent about buying real estate in London or discourage owners from selling, ” he added.
First-class property – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London ’ s prosperous south-west belt, stretching from Fulham WWimbledon, have more expensive at a record rate of 11.8% last year.
The prices in London have had a steady annual growth of about 5.6%, but have been overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market ” on which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) of the city, and the east (6.5%) have experienced an upward trend, according research by Savills.
Scientists could shed more light on the connection between the swings of a dog and its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail wedged to the right (from the dog's perspective), while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists are saying that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at University of Trento, said: “ It is well known that the leftist and right half of the brain reresponding differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions. ”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like humans, the right half of the brain was responsible for movement on the left and vice versa, and the two hemisphes played different roles in emofeelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral swingling of their fellow mates, the researchers monitored the animals while these films of other dogs looked at themselves.
They measure the heart frequency of the four legs and analyzed behaviour.
We will probably soon understand why the tail moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “ We have shown films to the dogs – either a natural version or a silhouhouette to eliminate distracting aspects, and we could control the movement of the tail to the left or right. ”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wedging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tendency was mainly to the left (again from the weddog's perspective), their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
As Professor Vallorororara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
He is rather convinced that dogs have learned from experience as to what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: “ If you have different meetings with other dogs and the wedding with the tail in one direction is more linked to friendly behavior and the right hand side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences. ”
Researchers say that findings could give dog owners, veterinary arians and trainers a better understanding of their animal's emotions.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behaviour and scholscholgrant at the Faculty ty of Veterinary Medicine at University of Bristol, said that this had not been the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they watch an aggressive dog, and to the right when it is a satisfied dog.
Another research research at the University of Victoria in Canada said the following: “ dogs go closer to a robot dog when they are, tail tail tail wedged and not the right, rather than becoming wrestless – exactly the other way than in the Italian study. ”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore stir that in the various studies the dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two half of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception, ” BraBrashaw says.
But because their behavior is easily recorded, it will presumably not take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.

Pope Franciskus appoints First Cardinals in February.
On 22 February, Pope Francis will first called new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the most senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also ones who elect a pope, so that Franciscus will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal at the age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope election – this falls to a group of 120 120 “ eligible cardinals. ”
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that there will be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals, which is also known as Consistorium.
“ Pope Francisis decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistorium in February, so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals can be planned, ” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals will likely have fallen by February.
He explained that a Pope would normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of eligible cardinals back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The consistency of next year is significant because it has been the first ever since the election of Franciscan in March of this year, says Valero.
There is currently a certain overhang on Europe's side and especially Italy.
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance, ” he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of cardinals founded by Franciscan, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to find ways of reforming the church.
In the past the Pope decided everything alone.
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him, ” said Valero.
He explained that it is “ well possible ” for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this situation – it is all new.
Valero said that the bishops from large places were typically called to cardinals, but Francis was “ full of surprises – so we do not know who he apests. ”
GM is calling back new pick-up pressures in the United States for repairing the seat backrest.
General Motors call back nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet let Silverado and GMC Sierra -Pickup clicks built in 2014 in order to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat rest, according to a communication from the US vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for moving the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal directives on vehicle safety for head restraints.
“ When the vehicle is mounted from the rear, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect passengers, causing an increased risk of injury, ” read the news of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The reclaimed models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GMT printing began in June and represents the main model start of the leading US-car car manufacturer since the insolvency related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which negatively affected car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra prints, redeveloped for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM declared on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra Pickup prints.
The share share of GM shares on the New York Exchange rose by 1.4 per cent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
An Obama voter cry of despair
I elected President Obama twice, hoping that change is possible.
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that were frustrated by Republican blockade tactics.
The blockade ade policy does not apologiise the web site problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks.
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 campaign are a sad memory of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a dreadful sad book.
It is a book that I thought would inflame me during the fooldeous second year of my medical studies, and give me hope.
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” descridescribes the memoirs of Barack Obama for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient papers in the evening and go to bed, the book will take me back to a time when politics inspired millions and row my breath of speeches.
The election became a landslide victory, and news spokesman to highlight the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on its way to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had 82% assent.
And then I close the book.
Again to switch to the present is a bad awakening as if being taken out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Indeed, something has changed in the years since I cast my first vote.
But it is simply not something I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and faceted things that Obama has achieved from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced secresion of homosexuality in the army and killing of Osama bin Laden.
I agree with the that party-political blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and closing Guantanamo Bay Bay, to name a few.
However, after having countless times defending the Obama administration against colleagues and acquaintintances, I have ended up trying to explain explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
RepublicRepublican blockade politics cannot explain either why they are allow for the intertapping apping of foreign heads of state, or the killing of innocent children by drones.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on private life from Americans and why whistleblower is punished, exposing government misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor can it explain why the public funding and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House ’ s efforts to calm the media are the “ most aggressive … since the Nixon government. ”
More recently, it cannot apuse the inability to design a simple website for more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know whether it is what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could conflict with political campaigns preceding it.
Obviously, the MPP is not a predictable course, because an opposition party and random events like the Newtown-massacre shape public debate.
But when I look at the examples examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that is what bothers me most.
I elected Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and ferfragmented alternative; he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free of pressure from future elections, would fulfil the hope that we had heard of for so long.
But, as Obama's approval ratings fell to below 45% this week, this book has made all the more harder to return to 2008.
It arouses the yearning in me for the many promises that have broken up in air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to make a severe loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election workers after the decision, he told his employees that they should get back on course and follow the purpose of their cause.
“ I want us to regain our magic, ” he said.
We must remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr President, and I could not agree with you more strongly.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave.
The billionaire and parliamentarian Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters may become pregnant and could benefit from it.
The mining magnet, which is in a court dispute about paying $6 million in a carbon tax, claimed when he wanted to brush aside questions about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that are important for deciding whether to cut or cut CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest, that the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
“ He is in a major conflict of interest as regards paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not holidays or not ”, said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine cost seat of Fairfax with 53 votes ahead of the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process so that it can take place more quickly.
Tony Abbott ’ s daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“ We need a better system, ” he said.
Why should we not have a system where you step in, enter data into a computer immediately, vote, and then have the result at 6: 30 a.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers.
Do you use them because you can eliminate the results if you do not like them?
Coordinating with pencils today is incredible.
The Election Commission has examined the options for electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, declared that his policies include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new post “ very seriously.
A public office is about the service to the public.
“ We do not seek any reward except that of history, namely that we can serve at a critical time of this community, ” he said.
RBS is suspending two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide official investigation into the alleged manipulations of the currency market is gathering ating speed.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities in investigations into the world ’ s largest financial market in which 5.3 trillion US dollars change ownership every day.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening investigation caused by the Libor interbank scandal.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspension, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
“ Our investigations on this issue are continuing and we are operating fully with the FCA and other regulators, ” the Bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, persons persons close to the situation reported that the RBS had transmitted the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the British regulatory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is said to have been approved at JPMorgan by his current position as European head of Forex -Spot trading.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was expted this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been accused of any misconduct.
The Usher Instant messaging group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma declared that it was seeking alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Agency Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently allegations that bankers having made an deal on currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched internal investigations, or information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks break through instant messages and e-mails several years in search of cases of misconduct.
News about these investigations has upcked traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years but this year has been under pressure because low currency volatility restricthe opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign-exchange market, but leading traders believe this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that, despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use by banks of own internal platforms means that “ one can influence the market with very low ticket prices. ”
The news came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it had terminated a trader at London London Exchange Traded Funds Bureau this week after causing a loss of nearly $six million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed and cooperated with the competent authorities.
“ We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained, ” Credit Suisse said.
Building fence on the Bechtle plot painted
A group of the citizens' initiative " Schweizer Wiese " has decorated the building fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleansed and widened her walk, says in a press release.
The planned cover of the decintegrating house at the rear part of the plot was not allowed for security reasons, because the site is threatened to slide down.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the plot, had arranged the beautitification campaign from the BI with his colleague Reinhard Domke.
Before the BI's action, a banner had been placed with the message' We are in favour'.
However, this caused little interference to the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative.
Her motto on the big poster was " We are against Bauruins ".
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the huge project should one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-s-by before the " building site " it it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city will be better for many people, even although many people have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign, because the city is delaying these answers, says the BI.
As we have heard, the mayor's public statements also have an impact.
May said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the collapse of the thermal bath if the time of the citizens' decision, the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on Swiss meadows.
Some therefore seem almost frightened, others feel them as a " crude attempt at blackmail " against the population, continues in the press release of the press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers.
Rangnick Selt for Schiris: Mane not a Swallow King
As satisfied as RRangnick is with the current high shape of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull in Salzburg, the sports director of the " bulls " has himself disappointed by the referees.
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into Schwalbenkings, " he defended the two offensive spirsters on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest reason for Rangnick's criticism was the yellow for Mane at 3: 0 versus Grödig last Sunday, where the Senegalese was supposed supposed to be a fatale - but this was not of course, as the TV pictures showed.
" A grossly wrong decision, " said Rangnick, who described referee of Harkam as " completely overstretched ".
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between the Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and the Grödig-coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He strongly defended his German compatriot:' In each individual situation I would have behaved in the same way as Roger Schmidt'.
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague after the squabble with Hütter.
I do not know why.
" Because I am the one insulted, " the 46-year-old stressed.
In view of the success, however, Rangnick adopted a loan anthem.
" There are only two words for this: really well, " he noted.
There is not much to be suspected.
Above all, the way in which the team plays is impressive.
It is safe for this to continue.
There will hardly be leadership changes during the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change.
" Except a player comes up with the desire he wants to leave the club, " Rangnick made clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court decided today that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges judges that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection Protection and Affordable Care Act – it compels citizens to take out health insurance or pay a fine by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority.
The top judge John Roberts took the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages law, and took the view that the requirement of the Health law stating that states should either extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise cancel all state Medicacaid subsidies is not unconstitutional.
The legal proceedings against the law had been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the ultimate challenger, Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian Place with Giant Light
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light to their darkest valley.
Due to the low level of sunlight, Rjukan located in the Vestfjjord valley usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at an altitude of 45 metres, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
" Finally! ", mayor Steinar Bergsland warmed at the launch ceremony on channel TV2.
Some valley inhabitants got in touch with sun chairs, others set up safety sunglasses.
So far, sun-hungry have had to travel to a nearby summit in winter with a cable car.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented a proposal to channel rays into the valley with mirrors.
This basic idea, however, has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million kronns (about EUR 615 000) expensive project.
A similar construction has brought winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine town of Viganella for several years.
Post is scarcely empty on Sundays
" Many citizens have not yet noticed it, the red points for the Sunday sitting are still at different letter boxes boxes in the city town and the city districts, but you read the small print on the yellow containers belonging of the Post AG AG, you quickly find that the voying no longer takes place on Sunday and holidays, " says the FDP.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, it is only emptied in front of the post building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakobob-Müller-Straße 1 Hüttenfeld.
Whether Sunday will be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten Sunday will not be answered in response to the FDP's request.
The FDP's social and youth policy spokesman, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up up.
Sundays screening is an important postal service in the case of appointment mail.
" This undertaking is reducing radically and unreasonable, despite the increase in the price of letters in January 2013 ".
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Groups and City Associations of the Liberal Group, supports his group counterparts:' What is annoys me is the fact that there are secretly laying times secretly changed or even removed'.
The post office is a few miles away from being close to the citizen.
" At least the letter boxes in the districts of Neuschß and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays, " says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also applicable for the heart of the city, especially non-mobile fellow citizens should also be able to reach a " Sunday mailbox also on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked the city parliament whether the administration is planning to contact the post office on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier answered that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
To his knowledge, however, there is also a Sunday sitting in Hofheim.
Your party has declared itself in favour of privatisation.
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere, " Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees should rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become much more expensive.
This morning, the Magistrate of the city is discussing a presentation of the devoter Stefan Majer (Green).
As a result, parking charges are to be increased by 50%.
For this, the prices should not be raised, but the time interval vals of parking and parking machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
The City Assembly Assembly will have to decide in December.
The Retail Committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this " not a good idea'.
The possibility of parking immediately before the store is " an ununderestimated advantage for smaller retailers ".
The transport club Germany believes that an increase after two decades is " quite appropriate and in fact long overdue ".
Public transport is becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast hosts
With a narrow cad, the I of the TSV FC Freudenstadt had to fight against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen.
The elders stood on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
Soon, however, they were not able to compete, due to their age, with the rapid actions of the happy cities.
The Gönninger worked extremely hard with the hard and placed surcharges.
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks carried out by Simon Schenk k k Eduard Schulz clean over the center of the network, and were not there for block block defense.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of pleasudencities in all aspects.
In view of this overwhelming and playful achievement, the third final sentence was won slightly ladly and seamlessly to the 3: 0 score (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).
On November 2, a much stronger opponwill be on the field with the TV Baieriersbronn, which won a clear victory in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B class the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were opposite in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a highly competitive two-hour match.
nervousness on both sides caused errors and points points; on the passes sports the precision was sometimes scar, and in some more critical scenes scenes prevented the player from winning possible points.
In this powerful and well-balanced encounter, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team was all consistent with the great physical commitment and a positive commitment of both teams.
Day of caring at the small English country hut
For the fifth day of care day in succession of the Natura 2000 project of Upper Hotzenwald a group of dedicated participants met at the small lodge lodge in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley should be cut in the area of the hut, said mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, so Kaiser Kaiser, described this area as the gley piece of the gorge, on which the landscape provided the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the Caring ing Day is a suitable instrument for strengthening the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to put his own emphasis in the realm of nature.
At the same time, the ecological aspect can be taken into account.
Friederike Tribukait explained this ecological aspect by the Department of Nature Conservation of the Government President of Freiburg following the greeting of Councor Tilman Bollacher, who took over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the foresight coincides with the aim of preserving the old Allmendan meadow which has now grown considerably, with its specific protected species of life, by opening and connecting with the existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grass ashouers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forests.
You need these free connections to conservation.
Tribukait said that at this point, she did not want to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to what was achieved with the Life project and the previous care days for the future.
After these various speeches, the district manager Christoph Wehle and Life manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had been beaten beforehand, the forest tractors were ready to call up if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of release juniper bushes and take care of a drying seal.
The aim was the free view at the vantage point.

Google, Samsung, Huawei are suing Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nordic patents on Thursday filed an avalanche of appeals for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including those of Google, the company that overbid at the insolvency auction of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 $4.5 billion, accused Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei, and four other companies for patent infringement before the US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is collectively owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents affect technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, such as the complaint that hit the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones working with Google ’ s Android operating system, which is fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of more than $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and recently offered $4.4 billion.
After being overbeat by Rockstar ’ s patents, Google Motorola Mobility acquired for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola ’ s library.
“ Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the appeal patents at the auction, Google has infringed and continues to violate the patents, ” according to the complaint.
Rockstar calls for a high compensation from Google, because it claims that Google ’ s patent infringement is intentional, so the accusation.
Egypt sworn first elected presidents
Mohammed Morsi passes his oath of office, but his day of triumphs should not mean the end of Egypt ’ s political disputes.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt ” when he was sworn as the country ’ s first freely elected president, and in in the succession of Husni Mubarak, who had been driven from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth state leader since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He laid the oath before the 18 judges of the tribunal dressed in black robes, who has his seat on the Nile and is similar to an ancient Egyptian temple.
“ We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic, ” Mursi said at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“ Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy, and stability, ” said the 60-year-old Morsi si, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been been targeted targeted as as a banned by the respective government since it was founded 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Morsi si arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to rechele the new president, and, unlike the presidential presidential glory of the Mubarak period, traffic traffic was stopped for a short time for the car convoy to cross the usually busy road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As uncharismatic “ spare wheel ” mocked at the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, presenting himself not only as an Islamist candidate, but to all those who wanted to target the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
“ Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional, and modern state, ” the Morsi, dressed sed in a blue suit with red tie, explained to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he lost oath of office.
Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he should make his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel playing the national anthem that he listened in havish delivery.
The military leader Feldmarshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of present in the largest listening hall in the university with voice choirs from “ The army and the people are one hand ”.
The University of Cairo, established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, developed into a stronghold for Islamist students in the 1970s.
Morsi delivered a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the insurgency that led last year to the end of Mubararak's authoritarian rule, and he reclaimed the promised presidential power that the Military Council had taken over from the head of state.
But by putting the official oath ath before the court and not, as usual, before parliament, he is bowing to the will of the military, indicating that the continuing power struggle will continue.
Morsi ’ s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek takes care of two great evenings.
The new season at the Falkenberger Discothek " Blue Velvet " has begun.

Two-life rapists in South Africa
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced twice life on Friday.
This was reported by the channel SABC.
The victim later died as the result of serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had been found guilty of crime earlier this week.
The fact caused horror across the country.
At that time, who was then 21-year-old, had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so appalling that the carers and nurses needed psychological assistance.
Kana admitted during the process that he had been in a bar in the Tatnacht with Booysen.
He also admitted having beaten and raped them, but denied to be responsible for dying the girl.
The police initially started from several perpetrators, but they released two suspects from suspects because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The public prosecutor's office also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost almost part of everyday life in South Africa: there are about 64 000 cases of sexual violence every year.
This is almost ten times more than in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the dark of 10 to 25 times in the case of sexual violence.

Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling, and grammar.
In courses on English literature, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel written in the 19th century, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The exam also includes “ unseen texts ” in order to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.

Speturer is professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant church communities of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Bodensee Cultural of Bodenstance cle.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum the question of how today people classify the " last things " after death.
If people had known too much of this over the past centuries, relying on those images of heaven and hell that " have shape our ideas up to present day, " the contemporary, prophetic teaching of the hopes of completion stands rather a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
" The greater hope of Christians and Christians has been expelled out by the critique of religion, " says the German speaker.
She has' provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks.
Johanna Rahner continues: " But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death. "
This raises the question of the longing' dreaming that in the end everything may be good'.
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at Albert-Ludwigs University from 1982 to 1989.
She earned her PhD Dr. theol in 1997 also in Freiburg.

The service was accompanied by the Laudato-Si group in the afternoon of the youth choir The Spirit.
By receiving the Firms Sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and praited the power of the Holy Spirit.
The firmlings had prepared themselves for the celebrations in the last few months, under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of a number of community members.
In various projects, they learned about various tasks of the Christian community life and together experienced the Youth Day in Unterchtal.

Pascal Treubel placed himself again on place two.
For the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli of the team nightmare that made it to the top of the winning deal.

On the way through mud, rivers, and the jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African doctors are not many doctors, but one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or with your mobile device.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the “ CNN Heroes of 2013 ".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him the “ CNN Hero of the Year ”.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father repeatedly lost his consciousness and travelled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only a broken arm, but then was an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a haemome that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, ” says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“ It is not easy, ” comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 o'clock and run to hospital hospital to be the first and are not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
By contrast, the ratio in the United States is that of a doctor for 413 people.
But even if they had a doctor, most camerosians cannot afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country ’ s health spending are private.
“ The only problem they have is poverty, ” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffer made Bwelle matured to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a not-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas at weekends and offers free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he forced up to 30 people into minibus buses and travel with snowy medical equipment on the roof over the unsolid terrain into the villages that need help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
Already more than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dance, and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wave – with its broad smile and its boundless energy – is happy to attend the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team begins with the examination of hundreds of patients.
“ We treat 500 people per ride, ” says Bwelle.
You come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crututches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for the school, but that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening the team carries out simple operations with local anaesthetic.
The operations usually take place in a school, town hall or an apartment; after the surgery patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next patient.
The lighting for the operation and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers are working until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a hard sting treat, but village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“ They drum all night so that we stay awake and continue our work, ” says Bwelle welle.
On Sunday the team then goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work that has been done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year, and knows that with its work work it is making a huge difference for the people it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a bbreak that he had received now allowed him to work again.
“ This is changing the future of my family, ” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“ I really do not know when he sleeps, ” says Katie O'Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel University, in Philadelphia, the second year and worked in Bwell's group.
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support a wave wave, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience they would never get at home.
“ We can be involved in operations where we help to p blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle, ” explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their journey to Cameroon and often bring donated sanitation material.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and instructions.
" He is, without doubt, a hero, " says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no limits.
For Bwelle, the almost permanent work is not a burden.
He is delighted in helping others live a happier life, thereby fulfilling a promise he has made to his father.
“ I am so happy to do this work, ” says Bwelle.
And I am thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellent Fight
The role of Santiago, the old man, in Hemingways's novel, " The old man and the sea " is Horst Janson is cut on the body body. The main role of Santiago is is the old man in Hemingingingingingingingways's novel, " old man and the sea ".
Janson is himself an old hase in his profession, the art of acting.
The old man Santiago Santiago cannot deceive anyone when fishing.
In this way, the two simply complement each other.
It almost seems to be able to see the wrinkles at the neck of the old man man mentioned by the fisherman Manolo.
If Santiago tired of life sits on the chair, that is true with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is a characteristic role that Janson can excellently master.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against fish through his knowledge and his willpower.
Janson is long known as the sole actor on stage.
He was a, and powerful,,, powerful and a member of Starfleet,, and he was named Jr... " He managed to to on the attention of the public, and he also a an interest in the heart of the universe.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue-illuminated bottles of water.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he brings the light on the respective active scene: the hut built by Santiago, the bar of the singer, Marie-Luise ise Gununst who, with her songs and her splendid voice, evings the feeling of life of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba ’ s rhythm and at the same time are guests of the bar.
Descent to the Romans
At a length of about 120 metres, a sewage channel from the Roman period was preserved during the Roman period.
If you visit Cologne, you will not miss the cathedral.
About 157 metres the two towers rise into the sky, making it the second highest church building in Europe.
But very few visitors, who admire the two filigree church towers, suspect that there is also a lot to be discovered under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the Cologne Underworld.
Meeting point for its guided tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Center directly at the cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacular: " We start in the underground garage, " says Schulze.
In the seventies the city fafathers wanted a city that was adapted to cars and therefore, of the remains of old city walls, the only thing remained was that was not too big.
This is why most users of the car park are now passing past the remaining Roman remains and only turning off their car.
But those who look more closely will discover an archaeological discovery site separated by metal grid bars in the park deck D2.
The ruins are about five metres high, made of handsell-sized stones.
" These are remains of the Roman city wall built after Christ in the second half of the first century, " says Schulze.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze allows participants on the upper park level to take a look at a dark 15 meter deep school shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is also hardly noticed.
The next station of the circuit is the pretorium, and here the participants go go down to the depth.
This is the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the preacher of CCAA.
A visitor wants to know what CCAA means.
" The short stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ", which means " the City of Roman Law and City of Agrippines, founded under Emperor Claudius ".
And the pretorium is the former palace palace, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the entrance of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewage channel, which is preserved here at a length of about 120 metres.
" You can quietly walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want ", Schulze encourages the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After taking the key at the box office, he leads the group to a 16 metre deep, walkable shaft.
" We are now in Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath, " he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground in order to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual washing.
Until today, at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read from the changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will become part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work due to begin soon.
However, it will take a few more years before completion.
near-hacked: relaunch ching the Rocker Process
A bloody attack in Rockermilieu is renewed after over four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous body injury and damage to two 30-year-old people started at the District Court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safeguards.
The defendants remain silent.
They said to have been active in the Rocker scene and were then part of the Bandidos Bandidos.
The public prosecutor's office accuses them of having entered and shot on three men in a car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured and a man had almost lost his leg.
The two victims of the were heard of the the competing group of HHAngelAngelAngels. The victims of the victims were said to be the of the group of Hell's s, and were said to to be in the hands of the competing group of Hell Angels in the wake of the aftermath of the war.
One is said to have been a high-level member from Berlin.
It seems to have been preceded by a persecution hunt with several cars.
The indictment was about rival fighting and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
A court spokesman said that it was not possible to prove that men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and were not recognized.
The Federal Court lifted up the sentence after the revision of the public prosecutor ’ s office and referred it back to the court for a new trial.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for another offence.
The opening began mainly with the reconstruction of the procedures in the Tatnacht.
The Commissioner identified at that time was invited to witness.
The focus was on mobile phone conversations between defendants and other people who had been intercepted by the police.
It is difficult that RoRocker almost always abide by - not testify - a law that suits them in court.
This is also the case for the victims.
In the first process only one of the victims had packed out.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the public prosecutor of Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that new traces had been appearing since the last trial.
Eleven even more days of negotiation are scheduled for the trial.
The Wayway Society doesn ’ t think
The night was long, music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
However, hunger is noticeable in the people's belts on the front-passenger and back seat.
Of course, one cocktail or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What is more logical than driving to the next Drive-In, to treat yourself a little bit?
I admit that I am happy to be present when going to fast food stops late or early in the morning.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then nix like from home and in bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco fans are evident.
For what do you have to miss to have a regular way of throwing your bags of fast food out of the car window?
Especially on weekends weekends discarded paper bags are located on street borders and parking spaces.
" Why? " I wonder.
Are people too doof to take the bags home or up to the next dustbin?
It is not only that the paper generator spills the landscape.
Transport facilities such as guide planets have already covered up bags, thereby causing accidents.
But what does said " Wegwerfgesellschaft " think about, it probably does not even know what this word actually means.
If you travel more often in the late evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a backbank can look like after ffeited nights: garments, bottles and other garbish fill there.
There, a few bags would make up more or less at all - in contrast to the street, where nobody wants to trample on the remnants of others.
I see the day coming already when the towns and municipalities are becoming to be foraway - and the fast-food chains have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Obama ’ s health-care drawback
After fierce criticism yesterday, President Obama took a backback in his often-repeated, unequivocal promise: “ If you like your health insurance, you can keep it. ”
After hundreds of thousands thousands have received a letter of notice from their insurers, Republicans in recent Republicans accused the president of misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relatized his original pledge.
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them, ” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on dismissals, Obama called on those Americans who have received such communications to look around on the free market for new insurance.
Most citizens could get better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more cheaper than predicted.
“ They get a better deal, ” he said.
The government called it as little surprise that the five% of the population who have themselves themselves an insurance would have to look for another tariff, because their contract does not comply with the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“ I would like to say directly to these Americans: they deserve better, ” said Sebelius said at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, being responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October.
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else, ” she said.
I am determined to regain your confidence.
This statement by an angrated Sebelius to a sitting behind adviser at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was accepted after a dispute with the Republican MEP BilBilly Long Missoursouri as to whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly asked ed why the “ architect ” of the Affordable dable Care Care Act did not voluntarily waiup state-sponsored insurance to pay off a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she wanted to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base
On Thursday an American government official wanting to remain anonymous asserted to the American news channel,, CNN, that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air force base in Syrian Latakia a day before.
The aim had been " missiles and related equipment ", which the Israeli Government feared would have been destined for Lebanese Hizbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was shot bed during the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis were responsible for this.
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base site in Latakia, featuring Russian S-125 125 Newa defence missimissiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads of up to 70 kilograms.
unsafe The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
But the Reuters news agency is quoting an equally anonymous Israeli government official by saying that he believes Israel has committed the attack, but is not certain.
In any case a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said:' We do not comment on these reports'.
In the daily Yedioth Ahronoth, the journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed that the Syrian regime tried tried, sometimes successfully, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean the crossing of a " red line " that a military response would follow.
John Kerry states in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has “ gone unreasonably too far. ”
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, suggested a weakening of the US defensive stance on its surveillance programs by saying that espionage has “ gone too far in certain cases. ”
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he decols responsibility with Barack Obama for having switched to “ Autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of Whistleblowers Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities became public.
The leaked information has put the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
In a video-related speech at the Open Government Conference in London, “ Kerry said: “ There is no doubt that the President and others in government government learned about things that happened almost by autopilot, simply because there was capacity to do what dates back to World War II, and difficult Cold War years and, of course course, September 11. ”
He then served as the first senior member of the US government to admit that US sppionage had exceeded a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, “ In some cases this has not gone too far. ”
The President is determined to provide clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that nobody has to feel feel that abuse is taking place.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process.
But Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives were saved by its surveillance operations.
He added: “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves into the air. ”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is keen to kill people, blow the air and attack governments.
So what if we were able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have been informed in advance of such plans.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel misgivings about alleged American sppionage and to convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the US in the field of anti-terrorist efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs stated on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to no longer participate in anti-terrorist organisations due to frustration about surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“ It is very important for the US national security interests for Europeans to remain on board for our joint efforts against terrorism, ” said MurMurMurphy, who is a democrat in the Senate and acts as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger through the NSA programmes.
Media reports showing that the NSA has collected millions of telephone funds in Europe have burdened ed relations with some US allies, even though the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited from documents passed by Snowden stating that the NSA has monitored the mobile phone phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world.
James Clapper, head of the national intelligence services, defended sppionage at allies and said this was common on both sides.
In all this turmoil MurMurphy said that his authority was preparing the congressional trip to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other Members participating are to be published in the next few days.
He said that the exact travel route was to be drawn up.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said that there would be some “ serious words. ”
He said that European governments must be honest honestly with their people about the kind of sppionage programmes that they themselves have been using for years.
“ While we can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also resign ourselves to the fact that we are not the only ones spying, ” says Murphy phy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a trip to the Middle East and to Poland at the weekend to deal with the resentment about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as US surveillance activities.

Australian appeals against jail in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for having falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi taxi driver, appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June of having guilty making a false statement after saying to the Thai police police that a local taxi driver raped them in the morning on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men stuck them.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely reached her hotel after she was separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she admitted to have thought out the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the ground.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the margins of Phuket, instead in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who addressed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra asking for help for his daughter.
Tunks said to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the wellbeing of his daughter and wanted to have her back in Australia.
“ We are very concerned, but we hope she will be back home as soon as possible, ” said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the sentence and is against a bail of 50,000 Baht at large.
Australian reports show that in the meantime she is on holiday in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court said that Bamford would be represented by a local legal lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that, after the recent murder of the travel driver Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may try to improve its damaged tourist image image and therefore therefore to an acquittal.
