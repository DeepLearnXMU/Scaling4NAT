Good Good: Greater safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres away from another: on Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian light was put into up into at at village parking park - within within of sight of the der town hall lights.
Two facilities so close to together: IntAbsicht oder Schildbürgerstreich?
Gutach's mayor gave a answer to this question yesterday.
" The town hall lamamp was installed at the time, because it ensures the path to school, " explained Eckert yesterday.
The light user traffic lights ensure both cyclists as well as bus passengers and mountain mountain occupants.
The plant, officially operational yesterday, is important for the crossing section of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well traffic traffic from the residential area ‘ Grub'.
" With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to in to for their safety, " says Eckert.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold of the regional counoffice of Offenburg.
" According to current measurements, on the B 33, about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality Gutach every day, about ten percent of which are heavy goods traffic, " stresses Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of a further traffic light is more than necessary: " Security is just precedhere ", says Arnold.
In total of four traffic views have been conducted, and a roundcircle was also been contemoted,, but due of the narsenof the narnarrowarea in the crossing section the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold everything was tested at the location choice of traffic masts, everything was tested: " By of an extra for us with particularly long logs loaded loaded long long timber logs, we we showed whether these vehicles can leave from the Sulzbach route to the B 33 without bend over traffic traffic posts ".
The traffic light system costs around EUR 15 000 itself is the " most modern thing it is available on the market, " explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that which shine so ously that the lights are easily visible by motordrivers even during low-standing sun, for example.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new one use barely eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
Moar the pedestrian push the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, immediately comes immediately green for the pedestrian, if not it will take about 15 seconds.
A further radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be stopped.
" If a group or people with disabled people cross the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone comes safely over the road, " explained Arnold.
Of course, the car driver has to think this as a partner here and watch the track.
This was not the case yesterday: Harsoon did the traffic light for pedestrians showed green, a upper class vehicle smothrough - with red ining red.
Josef Winkler has been writing the the light of his childhood and youth and youth for more than 30 years.
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the lination to crute violence and blunt sexuality, the ducrows and jojoness - were described by the Carthian poet many times.
The winner of the Büchner Prize is known known as prosaauthor, and the theatre texts are scarrare in his work.
Collage from prosing texts Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance " Wealchten auf der Zungenspitze ", which is now seen in Garage X on Saint Peter's Square, therefore therefore a collage of prose texts.
The theatre maker, for example combines elements from the autobiographically stcoed novel " The The fgi" " (1987) with " prosaminiatures from " Corpse, auauting his Family " (2003).
On the largely vacleempty stage - an important proisite: a tight shaped sofa on which it is simululated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble trathrough through the text material.
In this director Fresacher does not have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance reveals the the with a abundance of feature cases, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic play forms.
It is, the actresses are involved in the sometimes sometimes somewhat bious scenic implementations.
They are hard approached, with their head dipped under water, and with their their evening rays ropped to the wall.
Pressured into cellophane or bodice, they stze on dangerdangerously high stimes through the staging, they either monologize louamefully or are lying completely lensilent on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly communicyed in this hard way.
The best moments has the evening when is sung - the bandwidth ranges ranges from deep purple to popular song.
Only towards the end does the overturned sted show a bit to calm, and Winkl’ ’ s fsparksparkof absurd humor.
A Blackbox box in the car?
US road planners are looking for a money of to repair the decaying ating Highway system and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits every car in s dashboard.
The devices that record each kilometre travand report the information to the authorities are the the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning planning to revise the outete system for financing US roads.
The normally usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparkited an intense debate with mulcolorful alliances.
Libertarians have alliallied with environmental groups and argue that the government be able to use the small boxes to record the kilometres elled – and possibly also where they were driven – and then then use information information to ate tax mots.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is deeply concerned and a number of data protection concerns.
But, while Congress cannot agree on a single course, several states do not wait any longer.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system where drivers pay pay per mile travel over the next ten years.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which have with GPS surveillance.
This is is a must for our country.
“ It is nothing that we may only be using, ” said Hasan Ikhrata, CEO of the Southern California Assn. Governments, who is planning record record miles miles by all California an an drivers in the state starting from 2025.
The way in which we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed by taxes, paid by Americans at the fuel disppump, has bankrupt.
But America is not longer as much much in America as it used before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The government petal-oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has has not been rising for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare at high fuy prices to raise the tax by even a cent.
“ The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable, ” says Lee Munnich, an expert in traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs designed to test a milebased payment system.
“ That is the most meaningful long-term term alternative, ” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea is onshared with urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving in ways to reduce congestion and climate-damaging st gases.
Californian planners are counting on the system to formvising strategies to achieve the federal state ’ s ambitious legal goals on climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also said that he considers it the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also attracted by the idea of having drivers pay by distance distance.
“ This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole, ” explains Adrian Moore, vice president of Reason Guidelines.
People are paying directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US ministers of Transport, who, in a 2011 report, asked Congress to move toward a milebased boning.
The US Senate approved last year a $$90 million pilot, which would ing 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Represatives prevented the thrust, responding to the concerns of MEPs from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles to work or city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities are nevertheless nonetheless moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, who currently recruts 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s biggest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees to the state state instead of the oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot.
New York City is considering one as well.
Illinois tests it with trucks to a limited extent.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 east coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, motorists were skeptical of thinking that the government could pursue any of its movements.
“ Concconcern about Big Brother and such things were a big problem, ” explains Alddin din an,, head of strategy and result management at the Department ic Department in Nevada.
The people did not want it.
When the test started started, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into full-dged monitoring equipment. ”
There was no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is part of a number of states that now look for affordable technology that allows the government to capture the kilometers leelled, but not exactly when and where.
That, Khan said,, would also also be more reassured.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-p company called True Mileage in California.
The company was not originally set up to to help states taxation on motorists.
Rather, it was to take a way in an emerging emerging insurance insurance where where drivers would pay on the miles miles.
But the devices that she tested are also interesting to the road planners, they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
“ The people are more willing to take involved if their speed and sites are not recorded, ” explained Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
There mistakes have major mistakes in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experiment with giving motorists a range of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without a GPS.
Or they do not choose equipment at all and instead pay a flat fee instead based on the average miles travelling by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other agencies hope to sell the concept to a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with ones.
In New York City, officials want to develop a tax device that can also to to pay parking parking, insurance must be paid only for kilometres kilometres are travel, and speed data will be collected real-time from other vehicles that enable drivers to avoid congestion.
“ Driists would be motivated participate participate the added value of the advantages that the system offers, ” says in a planning document of the city.
But some transport planners wondering whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Territory, officials officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel on tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual tax could be imposed on drivers with hybrid or other low-petololvehicles vehicles so that they, too, pay a fair share.
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is suffenough, ” explained Randy Rentschler, the Head of Legislation and Public Affairs of the Commission.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers ists will worried about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small Bal Bal
The Voluntary Fire Service successfully ed their trial test despite the lack of a lack of personnel.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
The partmental commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the Feder estate estate in the Burgberger Straße in his practice acceptance.
It is said to have was a short circuit during sawing.
The result of the fire that, the, and the) and the smoke and and smoke smoke, as a result result the the injury of two two, but one of one one one one was one one one was was to to to send send a call to an emergency call.
Two respiratory carriers ers from Wehr were ready to enter the building after the building by Hans Kammerer review of the situation.
After a short time it managed the first find first person and guide him to free.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not that easy, there there was also a narrow stairs to overcome.
The building, a workshop with an integrated ststable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It was a lot of wood and straw w es in it.
In, there were also machines machines woodwoodworking.
The first fire was tion place over the tank in the vehicle.
Another further direction was conducted an oversurface hydrant at about 100 metres away.
Three deletion attacks could now be designed.
A hollow jet tube tube also also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer ’ s was was to showing what is to be done with staff with little available.
In case of emergency support is provided via the daily deployment group Königsfeld.
The commwas satisfied with the the of the performed.
Netlinking of higher universities and companies important
During his visit the district of Breisgau-HochHochschwarald, District President Guido Wolf was also explained in Titisee-Neustadt about where tomorrow ’ s workers come from.
At the funding center Hochschwarzwald he went together with the business senior school heads of the vocational schools as as as as the district ggymnum and the chairof of the advisory board with this important question.
" Education is an important location factor " " stressed lined Claudia Stehle the director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project project Education Centre HochHochBlack Forest.
In this time Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, a successful cooperation has been in the the town between the Support Centre, the Kreisgymnasium and Professional Education Center.
He also praised the family-family-friendliness in the county.
" It is important not only to look attention on the family phase but but due to demographic change, also the phase for carcaring for loved ones, " Wolf Wolf.
He also said that more and more employees were looking for carafter and care for their relatives.
" Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end end the employment relationship, " Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
" For anyone who has already to the advantages of the region during their course of studies studies their acquired acquired knowledge and skills often often retained to the regional economy, which contributes to the forancement of the region ", the President of the Rural ag was convinced.
Only if only if sufficient training places be offered can the demand for skilled workers also be met.
In his opinion, the locational advantage of the district is its advantageous location in south-west Germany in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
On his also elled his rail journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg experienced the efforts already made for the expansion of public public passenger transport.
" Keep ububnborn and ensure that public transport gets better, " he explained to the local councians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with Music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting Dietinger senior iors to coffee, cake, and afterwards to a vesper.
In the past, the older citizens were hosted in the rest area.
In the meantime this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The residents were forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there were sausage salad.
With popular melodies entertained SilKimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmir.
The over 100 0-old natural stone wall, as a prediviarcary of the old school, which was before renovated to the Kirchstrasse, is once again again be added to the rehabilitation plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, during the first work on the rehabilitation of the front school, a small angle wall was installed in the stabilize and static relief of over one hundred year-old old stone wall with balustrade.
The next approach is, according Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger icipBuilding Office, to include the National MonumHeritage Office in the plans and to create a reation concept for the old wall.
After states that the calculation will be calculated by experts, which will then be put on the table of the Council Council to decide and determine the further approach.
A decision on this is probably to be taken next year.
After the rehabilitation, ppement aving and tree planting of the old school home house the two side wings of the school built in 1912 12, in the foreseeable as a follow-up measure, the limitation wall in need must thoroughly renovated and placed on new understructure.
The historic, hunduryear-old old wall of wall of the old school school yard to the church road, is particularly affected due by water and frost damage, there is no drainage, in need renovation and has inclinof ararch forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones are to to damage, but currently the wall is not in danger of collapse.
A sturable wall is a prerequisite for one of students to use schoolyard, which has done through the current fastening work.
Originally, school yard renovation was planned planned in 2008 / 2009, but high unscheduled expenditure resulted in a shift.
An important word in the historic restoration of the walls, which has even been used for film ming, will be heard by the National Heritage Office.
If preses are coming from this site, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the monument conservation ists.
The students of Bräunlingelementary school, who are now being taught in a well-renovated old school building with a new ula ula, soon able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir will receive jazz jazz training in Stuttgart
In the discussions on the future of the music higher schools in Baden-Württemberg have also joined by Cem Özdemir, Federal President of the Greens.
" I think it is wrong to abandon the holistic training at the University of of Music in Stuttgart, said Özdemir said " Stuttgarter Nachrichten ".
Jazz and classical music come together at the jazz location in Stuttgart.
This means why Özdemir, who is regarded as the favorite for a direct mandate in the Bundparliamentary election on 22 September, is contradicts the Green Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this is is accelera reorganization of the five music higher schools in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, the course of Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the University of Music Music to the HighHigh School of Music in Mannheim.
US border: discovered' super tunnel' for drug smuggling
On the Mexico-US border, investigators have discovered and closed a' super-tunnel' for drug smuggling.
As US customs have reported, the more than 500metmetlong long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railways, and an ventilation system.
Three suspects were therefore arrested, eight tonnes of marijujuseized and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
According to the information the tunnel tunnel had not yet been used.
" These cartels are stupid if they think that they can dig g under the radar, " said the Proorney General the US Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse San Diego, where one end of the tunnel was discovered.
Duffy was, to the drug asssaid:' if you continue to build such tunnels and are trying to use them, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money'.
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in a ongoing battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77th 000 people have been killed in Mexico drudrug-related crime.
Experts by Experts
Due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it has been constructed by architects and engineers, and that the construction would take around a year.
The track system was equipped so that electrically driven cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building building is 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 20 metres to the actual entrance of the tunnel.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 m height and 90 centimetwide.
It would also have been the useful to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine drug.
The third, a Mexican,, was captured for the confiscof marijuana.
All three are facing the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, as officials have said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, as continued at the press conference in San Diego.
However, it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Cocaine conormally ine is ggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the the " despair " of drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now cut off off, said Bill Sherman from the DEA drug investigation in San Diego.
They would do everything possible to get the United States.
No details were been given about the detained, at least one is Mexicans, it was said.
They have to prison prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 Cels the ular Geisinger
The anniversary of the town of Geisingen to the 1250.
Returrence of the first mention is closer ever closer.
When the year finishes in just than eight weeks, the anniversary year will approaching.
Geisingen and Kirchench-Hausen were mentioned for the first first in documents in 794.
A certificate has been made in churches to ing both places.
On 15 March there will be be official prelude to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall hall, this prel-off event takes place in the the place where both was first mentioned mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
Within the framework of the anniversary several events are planned both in Geisingen as well as in church Hausen.
Churler-Hausen will be held in 1250 July on a tive weekend from 18 18th to 20 of July.
We are celebrating again.
On Friday with a festival, on Saturday and Sunday, with a party around the church alhall.
On this weekend weekend, there is also also the the esch-Hauschurch festival.
City music director Rudolf Barth has written an contract position for the city in honour the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
Am 21 21 zusammen mit der Sonnwendfeier des Schwarzwaldvereins, am 12. in der Arena mit Feuerwerk und am 13 13 als Konzert der Stadtmusik in der neuen Festhalle.
This will be completed in the anniversary year lee year, the official date will be on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee a new chronicle will be published.
" But it should not become a chronicle of Geissitself, but also a printed work about the Geissingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, church Hausen, Leipfererdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen ", Mayor Walter Hengstler.
Today ’ s singing singing also celebrates its 2014, and 1974 ’ s space was realized with the in 1974.
The new chronicle is due to be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
However, 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
Die Narrenzunft Strohglonki beginnt am 8. mit einem Brauchtumsumsanlässlich anlässlich ihrer 60-Bestehens, die Harmonie Gutmadingen wird 90 Jahre und hat am 29 März das Festbanett und feiert ert das Bezirksmusikfest.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger Schule has at the new location for 50 years and and rates this on May May, Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the Well Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned documented in a certificate of donations owned by the St. Gallen Monastery in 764.
The document was made in churches (Hauses) which at the time time court court.
Both municipalities, therefore, mentioned in the same document.
reason of 2014 to celebrate this 1250-old accordingly, in addition, the church reform is 40 years ago.
Council geting Rail Council
Is the railway Am Hirschen Hirschen crossing supposed to be be sively in built to increase road safety?
Yes, the local councils decided.
Schiltach has to to EUR EUR 220 000 for this.
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line in the coming year.
In particular, it is to increase safety safety at railway crossings - there are collilisions across nationwide of trains with other vehicles.
If municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they have to with a third of the costs, while the rest share the railways and the federation.
Schiltach's city builder Roland Grießhaber explained the specificfeatures of the crossing " Am Am Hirschen " to the municipal council.
There the city city planning to build a gorge at the height of the tunnelmunthe west of the railway tracks.
There, even larger vehicles, for example those those carrying long wood, could be there in countertraffic without without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to a necessary necessary wall wall so that the city could wiaden the following road in time course time to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was a controversial issue in the local council because some councils called into doubt on the need for road propagination Thomas Thomas Kipp summto the ed up the mood of the critics' Must we to so much much because of of so few vehicles?'
Mayor Thomas Haas discontradicted: The railway " Hirschen crossing is used used for Langhl transports.
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area will be transported over this route partly because the vehicles up to 20 metres long were unable not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn there into the main road.
In addition, the route serves as a ting for those vehicles are not not use the tunnel when the main road is closed, argued sharas.
Since it is clear that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels need to be reand rerenovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the " Am " Hirschen crossing crossing also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to examine the costs would be from by the planned expansion of the roads.
Despite withstanding, the conversion of the railway crossing crossing was largely approved approved with the stiviso that the required supporting wall is built in such a way that the city following road towards " Bahnhofstrasse " to, if necessary, to about 5.5 metres for meeting traffic.
The reconstruction of the railway crossing crossing at Gerberei TrauTrautwein could entail a different different problem which concerns the access to the rapidly rising' Geroltzhäuser Way'.
The administration had examined the conversion plans of the railways by the engineering office Breinlinger, because it had doubts to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Wegs then be be possible.
The investigation concluded that it is not be ruled out that the incof tendency of the roads could lead to longer vehicles being on.
The responsibility for this lies with the city as as road road ad-carrier.
The conversion could, therefore,, lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber removal and bending worked in the current state, one one should not agree to reconstruction of the railway crossing, as argued.
At is also the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on transition is significantly lower than the other railway crosscrossings, being directly beside the middle of the stop to which there a good visual connection.
Even trains from the central station should already be slowed down to far point there is no risk of collision.
The majority was refused consent to the conversion of this railway crossing, the the city of Schiltach would have to' the the the the of sitting sitting vehicles, according to the Councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction has been completed.
The panel considers no problems with the conversions at the railway cross" vor Heueubach " and " Vor Kuhbach ", for which cross-agreements have already been concluded with the railways.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
distant planets, gravitational waves, black holes - Experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on on two major projects that they want to start in the coming years.
30 proposals were to choice, five are still in the race.
Forar worlds.
More than 1000 planets on other stars have already found astronomers.
No one knows whether there exist on at least some of them.
It is difficult to choose: should you look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search search for ets ets like the earand and perhaps discover extraof-restrithly life?
These questions are being raised by those in responsible of the European Space Agency Esa.
For their programme " Cosmic Vision ", they are seeking ideas for two large space space projects are order decisively advance research.
The budget for such " L missions' is is around EUR 1 billion each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite te European space space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas under discussion, five of which are now shortselected.
Numerous bodies examine the proposals, follow up with the researchers.
In the next few days a final decision should be taken by the scientific programme committee.
In total four major questions were chosen by Esa to which the missions of the 2007 program " Cosmic Vision " programme should find answers.
What are the conditions for creation of planets and life?
The precise processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and hence the formation of planets orcircle these stars - remain in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared infrescope in space penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life be created there?
To investigate this question, 2017 is to launch the space telescope, " ops " ", will will ines examine already known planetary systems in our immediate area.
The possibilities are limited limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map earth-like planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres and look for " biomarkers ": gases that are regarded as an indicator of biological activity.
How does the Solar System work?
This question, too, should shed shed on what preconditions there are for the emergence of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star, and the interaction of its magnetic field (as well as the the of the magnetic) the magnetic)) well well)) the the the particparticparticradiation (the the) the the) the the the the the the star and the interaction with the planet system.
In our solar system, these processes can be as an example.
With the " Solar Orbiter " the Esa has already approved an M-class mission (where the budget is is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is start in 2017 17 and observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and his moons.
They want to find out the role of Giant planet has played in developing the solar system.
For this the Esa provides the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision " programme.
The probe " Juice " (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is probably begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later she reached Jupiter and was expected to study the planet's atmosphere well as the icy moons, Europe, Kallisto, and Ganymed.
What are the basic laws of cs of the universe?
Worldspace offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions, thus to to whether whether the laws of nature that we know know still valid there.
There may also be deviations that could give physicists the way to a new theory that which uniites all the known laws of nature.
How did the universe arise and what does it consist?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was born by the Big bang.
In addition to familiar familiar matter, which consists of stars, planets, and creatures like we, there is dark dark, whose gravity holds galaxies and cluies clusters together, and dark energy, which action the ’ 's expansion acceleraccelerated.
Researchers researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fraseconds of the Big Bang, nor what the consist of dark matter and dark energy.
With " Euclid ", the Esa has already approved an M-M mission, which is to be launched for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe investigate the distribution of matter in universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus provide conclusions about the nature of of dark matter and dark energy.
Who can Race the Race
Of the 30 proposals only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
The best chances of obtaining as an an L mission is according to many experts " " E-Lisa ", a sophisticated concept for demonstrating gravitational waves.
By means physicists changes in the structure of spacspactime that Albert Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proved until date.
Elisa could do this, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission provides for an consisting of two three three probectors to be stationed in space.
In contrast to Earth installations, it could also demonstrate gravitational waves created by the big bang, new knowledge into the emergence of the cosmos.
Four other proposals also compete for the second L-mission: a large X-ray X-elescope called " Athena, which which aims to explore black holes, " Icy Plan" " another another mission to another mission outer ets of the solar system, " Prism " " a surveying mission of the cosmic background radiation, and " Exoplanet " " " Exoplanet Finder to detect and study earth-like planets.
Already have emerged, there include proposals for for sample return transport from Mars, for research into the moon, Venus and asteroids ids as well as solar physics.
Snowden Alposed to “ cooperate with Germany on US surveillance.
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence service's whistleblolower, has said that he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify to German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander provide no answers about their activities.
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was received asylum to discuss the testimony with him in Germany.
In a letter by Snowden, presented by Ströbele to the the media on Friday, Berlin, he wrote: “ Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissent as a trual chip, and seeks to criminalize political expression with threatening criminal threats that defense is defense. ”
But, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he believes convinced that support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The charge ment made by the Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German interior minister, Hans-Peter Friedrich, to time online: “ If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German German representatives, then we find ways to make this possible. ”
US-German relations are burburby by claims that the NSA has tapped the mobile phone by Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Ströbele explained that, according to former NSA employee Snowformer ’ lawyer lawyer, he cannot return to Russia if he leaves the country.
If Snowden says es in Germany, he needs a assurances that he is “ safe,, ” says the depP.
Snowden states in his letter that he would would be subjected to a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that has driven him out of his eland.
But he is touched by the world-wide response to “ my act of political expression. ”

In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation are resolved. ”
Frontier Airlines will charge charges for cabin baggage
Frontier Airlines plans planning to charge up to USD 100 from passengers wanting to store hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to USD 100 for piece of hand baggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if it was in the announcement's announcement that passengers are to keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage gage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said that USD 25 is calculated if the fee is paid paid in advance and USD 100 for travellers who paid only at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said that the fee of $100 aims to indumove travelers to take care of the payment.
“ We do not want to calculate this amount, ” she explained.
Carriers began in 2008 by charging the first and second piece of Checed baggage.
Passengers who try to avoid them have therefore put as much as possible into hand baggage, which means that the trapartments above the seat are often crowded.
Fees are one way of getting passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really a matter of making money.
It concerns the most faial Frontier customers, who would clearly stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to place in a subject above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may take a free of baggage baggage with with free at the gate gate fronfrontier, but the next person has to pay $100 for a similar piece of baggage.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures were changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they came to the boarding gate.
Frontier's new cabin baggage fee only come into force in summer and there is not have an exact date.
Passengers often complain about baggage allowances and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the transportation of the baggage should cost money and passengers pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that the airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most, far have left fingers from charges for hand baggage.
Spirit Airlines, Inc., demanded first first for hand baggage baggage three years ago and later followed Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the airline advisor Jay Sorensen, who follows the supplcharges closely.
In a report of December 2011 he estimated that the hand baggage fee Spirit Spirit raising USD 50 million per year.
Sorensen, who previously formerly a leader at Midwest Airlines, was flown lown with Spirit, and was curious about what he would expect at the boarding gate if passengers faced faced the company ’ s unusual hand baggage fee.
“ The boarding process was one of the most smoothly I have experienced in my career in aviation, ” he said.
I waited to see gnashing teeth teeth and hand discussions at the boarding gate.
‘ The plane was full, ” he said, ‘ and boarding was like lubricated. ’
Frontier also follows Spirit the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice were to keep the whole can and coffee would be filled free of charge.
Water continues to be charge.
US Airways had briefly tried to request money for for soft drinks in 2008, but reversback seven months later after passengers had complained and no other large company had moved.
Frontiers's move to levcharges for hand baggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline carrier is the most recent initiative to to direct customers to their own website.
Carriers pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to US $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to get passengers to buy directly with them rather than via an online travel agency.
However, frontier has gone the dest in this area.
In September, the company began to award half half its many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, miles were cut once again to 25% of the route.
An flight journey booked by a third party, with frontier more than 1000 miles, therefore customers customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when purchasing directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is inking and the company loses money.
The proceeds fell by 9% and the flight capacity shrased just just under 13 percent in the first quarter as is be seen in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
Republic has tried to control the finances of frontier as part of the sale of society.

Bombardier, based in Montreal, not publish flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft, and did give new information on whether the aircraft could commercial commercial according to the ambitious timetable of next September.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft was followed a and a half months followed only three three take-ches, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is continuing as planned.

We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test for the aircraft progresses.
However, if new orders are not announced in the next few months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries range can catapult it into the lower segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented in March and flew w first time in September, after months of delays.
But binding orders have been for the the CSeries have 1717moderate, as potential purchasers want waiting for the results of flight tests and see whether the company claims about fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new jet liner liner are correct.
There are currently total total 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.

“ The test aircraft has no longer on the ground than expected, ” said Beaudoin at a conference conference and added that while the aircraft ’ s service life, groundground testing and software had been scheduled.
Each manufacturer has to plan differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then to end a review period, as we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks and the rest shortly after that, the company ’ it it.
Yet, analysts remain sceptical whether 12 months after the maiden flight, the first customer can a CSeries aircraft eries service.
Bombardier said that it is examining the the EIS planning) and will update it in the coming months.
“ The slow progress of the flight test – though it apparently correspond BomBombardi’ s internal planning – reinforced our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015, ” Doerksen.
In the third quarter, September September 30, Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $147 million, or $8 cents per share share of $172, or $9 cents per share the year before.
Adized earnings per share is unto 9 cents.

Net orders orders dropped from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order book in the aerospace Division was $32.9 billion on September 30, unchanged compared to 31 December.
“ In the aerospace sector, the results were consistent to our specifications, but low order intake and market conditions were disappointing disappointing, ” said Beaudoin.
Aerospace erospace sales fell by 13 percent, to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest railway manufacturer in the world, announced that sales in this sector has risen by almost 11% to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport division was $32.6 billion on September 30, increasing slightly compared from December 31.

Basharat Ditta, 42, reported to underworld size Neil SScarborough
The lawyer feared that His Secdden g Addiction Will come to Light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be discovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied subworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his his activities in drug drug trade after been compromised by his own cocaine.
The lawyer, praised by criminalists as “ first-class ” lawyer nicknamed “ Bash, ” was arrested in his house in 2011 after police police overSScarborough he he in a earlier drug trial.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the home's lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a meal of the bar.
The investigquiries revealed that Ditta regularly regularly ed drugs in class A after traces of of cocaine had been found in his hair, his wallet and and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then under police police as in a major investigation investigation into the heroin and cocaine trading in Lancashire, Cumbria Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police in a series of house searches of of heroin and heroine worth cocaine, and £200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals fearfear that his drug addiction could be publicised.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors office in Blackburn, was found and convicted at Liverpool Crown Court Court after a of three trial on two charges for hinstructhe justice.
He admitted ownership of cocaine in an previous survey.
The lawyer was convicted after the police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and wathow he go to Ditt’ s house and put the the drugs with a 60% glove in black black gunder the lawyer's garbage bin.
Shortly after supplying drugs, Scarborough regularly phed Ditta, who at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, the drugs drugs were, and then nine ements were exchanged between the two.
The court revealed that DDitta was a “ regular consumption ” of cocaine after tests of of class A drugs in his hair, his wallet, and his credit cards.
Ditta was arrested arrested but but uted to take cocaine, saying that he had talked to the alleged dealer, because he was his client, claiming that her discussion was subject to “ legal secy. ”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and received a sample of his hair.
In police interrogation he claimed that he runs an office both both his private address and in the workplace, and clients would calling him at home for legal matters.
The court revealed that he had called to major drug trafficking actors, some of he had had previously represented, after significant arresarrests and what what investigators knew about them.
ProProsecutor Anne Whyte said, “ A criminal prosecutor should know better than anyone else that you do not breaking the law. ”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as criminal defender because he has in too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug traff, but of a drug traffickwho supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications ements have was been legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these people.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between the lawyer and client.
He acted against the police investigations as as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta rejected every every conduct, arguing, “ If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I do not,, and I wanted to pass information to Scarborough, I would not wait wait 15 hours, but do it immediately. ”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead said from the police in Lancashire said “ “ Mr. Ditta took the step from from a criminal defender to a a criminal the he began to buying drugs from organized criminals. ”
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading organised crime who entruasked him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and trust and confidence in the confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and has tried to entrench himself behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation into Ditta, which also led to a case convicencing for possession ing cocaine and judicial disability, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals, showing that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in jail after guilty of conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine, and cannabis.
Thirthirthirty other people involved in the drug trade were sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream dream job was to be a lawyer lawyer for in death death row,, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality inequality opportunity the motivation for his work.

Trafflight lights light in red red: watch care for waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light simply not not green.
The contact pattern in the road does not react, or the light sign is broken.
What should we do do - driving on red?
If a person person has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the crossroads is free, he can go on, the Stuttgarbased law lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorcycle ".
The waiting time must however, be " appropriate', which can be interpreted interpreted differently on a case-by-case.
Becker recommends that to last at least five minutes before the is that that traffic lights light malfunctional.
Anyone who continue the ride spite of red lights, however, must be aware that they are fully responsible for an accident that caused.
Anyone who tolerate for less than five minutes you may not wait long enough, Becker warwarns and refers to a decision by the Court of Highords in Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver after about three minutes of red had ignored the traffic lights and had to answer a negligent red light offault.

Security concerns in Mozambique are Growing in the clashes between influential
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputto the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and the first president of Mozambique, to accto the calls for peace at a rare public demonstration.
“ We want peace once again, we want stability, ” ” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
For fear for the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the label “ We Cfor Safety Safety in Portuguese and and part with the crowd on the independence place of the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been reports almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst wars since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a infamous rebel movement that was initially supported by the whe-governed rhodesia and later by South Africa's aparthd government in an effort to destabilise the country country's independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts find the country unlikely to reverrevert back into full-trilown conflict, but recent events have worled foreign investors and locals.
The stat stake for the rapidly growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal coal reserves in the Northwest could in years to investments by more than $50 billion by firms such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo have blaming each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the clashes by attacked its members in the province of Sofala province, a traditional amos stronghold, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalescalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases, and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, group leader, explained Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government is blaming Renamo for the clashes and accused the organisation of having attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay the concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama would himself himself as a loloser, ” who “ wants to deploy all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government. ”
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns have intensiated since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT that he was meant that Frelimo does no longer respect the agreement.
“ Our vision is to restopen negotiations in serious terms, ” said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to the settlement of the tensions caused by a series of clashes this year.
“ We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who who hing the heads together, ” says Joseph Hanlon, lecer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating, and one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who urfor electoral reform, has already said that will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt of a troubailing movement to obtain concessions and financial perks from the government.
Renamos electoral successes has been decking since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former RenRenmember, to Morático Democático de Moçambique (MDM), is probably improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – who will resign when his second term ends next next year – will destroy the country ’ s democracy.
" He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up presidency, " says Mazanga.
It is unclear what Renamo's capacity has, but she has launched unsconcerome attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South link.
Most batthave took place in the Sofala province, which is a few hundred north of Maputo, but where you can find Beira, uses the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio interoff using the railway for a month, after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga cautently repto the question of whether Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not doing well in Mozambique, ” said Mazanga.
Instinstability has exacerbated frustration with the government,, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about the corruption, slow progress progress and a recent wave wave ababduction.
“ People think that the government and president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the who finding solutions to the problems, ” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that the people simply wanted stability.
“ Not no interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they want to restore peace and usable roads again, ” he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ models for life, ” says one author.
Thor or stories showed that “ “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks, ” ” the Arus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are far wild wild, too offensive and, in some cases dirty to be taught in schools, ” which is Crossley-Holland advocfor a “ careful selection ” of age-age works.
“ I am surprised that American myths and folklore are already part part the education, ” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that for authors and teachers who are “ over-didacactic ” children would “ shut off off ” ” because in entertaining stories the messages are “ subliminal. ”
Crossley Holland, who translated Beowowulf from Anglo-Saxon and the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, has explained: “ You can pursue certain intentions, but you possible to keep them in the background. ”
Perhaps the most dest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author writing for children lies in the need to mediate hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
It must be subliminal ly presented, which history history revealed and not explained.
That is the old story of showing rather than telling.

Geching: No absolute Protection AbsolProtection
" We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning early early stage ", Mayor Jens Häußler opened the civi’ information event to discuss the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the MunicipHall to explain the measures being planned, to ask questions, express concerns and bring forward ideas.
Häußler made clear: " Ultimdecisions are made by members of the municipal council ".
The flood, which hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009, unprepared, had been a drisievent event which raised the question of protective measures for the future, to Häußler.
A river area study had been commissioned with the neighbouring community of idlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
" The protection of as many plots as possible is the goal " " says Häußler.
The planning is based on the protection against a flood according according the German eological Service tically expected expected every 100 years.
Climate change is covered by a a% surcharge.
In experts circles this is called " HQ 100aClimate ".
The masses of water that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 in to to a 00-years of floods.
" There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement " says Häußler.
To achieve the protection HQ 100aClimate, around four million euros need to be invested in Gechingen, although the community can count expect state subsidies to the amount of around 70 percent.
But Häußler pointed out out that the would only be exist if an overall concept is implemented.
For this end the community would on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure needs to be completed.
At best, implementation implementation can begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which has already been presented in the municipal Council last week (we reported) provides local measures in the infx of the river Irm from the Stammheimer Valley.

Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the Wald engineering Wald and engineering engineering engineer from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the total of the desired goal.
In addition, one is to to the most most economical solution, says Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
There was discontent among those adjacent to the Altor who, even with normal thstorm rain, repeatedly repeatedly suffer from overload of the channel network.
The problem is well known in administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the directives on canal systems are different than those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed.
The municipality would be obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of events could be dealt with.
To resing sesewers more larger would devour millions.
Seriavily jurunded after Clision
Early on Friday afternoon, on the provincial road 44 44 near Revensdorf, two drivers have been seriously injured in a fron-on lision.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could say little about the how of the accident.
However, there are various testimonies which should to be evaluated first.
It is certain that the 19year-old year-old leader of a VW Golf went to the Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf accommodated her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman being so heavily trapped that took the fire department gless half an hour hour to get her from of the vehicle.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unresolved.
Both patients came to nearby hospitals.
The track was completely closed for about two hours.
One could call him the US Dostoyevsky.
Philip K. Dick was a God seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something seriserial.
Amazzling the relationship in the outside: the shoeping eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And as Fyodor M. Dostoysky is to be understood with his massive oeuvre as an explwator and apologist of the Russian soul, then Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who holds holds something in his own country.
Some titles have been been published by Heyne Verlag ing publish,, which Haffmanmanette ette ette with the 11) ((1)) ((((1))))))))) have have published published the have have publishpublished by Heyne Verlag Verlag (He)) HeHeyne),, the Haffmancassette distriells the 118 narratives the more than over two 00enein.
Dick declares America - the realm of breathtaking gering technological progress, coupled with paranoia, the ia ia secursecurity and the belief of have been chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, had added drugs to his brain.
He has, from early on, that the calculators are divin.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the creator from his creature.
This is the Blade Runner " problem.
The kkilling.
A Maver of science fiction.
A a fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired inspiration to film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The " Child Report " dates dates from 1956 1956 and uuthe scent of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals.
It develops the principle of " pre-crime ", " pre-crime ", i.e. what has now become more or less official White House doctrine.
In Dick ’ s world that is our fririfingly, mutants look into the future - and the police are on.
" We capture individuals who have not violated any law, " says the head of the authority.
'We grab them even before they can commit violent crime'.
And:' There are no serious criminals in our society,, so we have a criminal camp of pesdodo criminals' you read time flows.
They assume that bad will happen and prevent the criminal idea from being put into action.
Dick ’ s story acts like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the eavdropping of the NSA.
Anticipating the attack: That is is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick ’ s story is not finished.
The head of the police ains that there is no separation of powers of powers, that the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the superviser is supermonitored and committed of a future crime.
The system is turning through.
It is perfect, but it is lying.
It invents its own preconditions.
Conakes mistakes and and not only only, but but ds on them.
The system creates the danger it is combagainst.
Philip K. Dick read, and again again come closer closer the truth.
Testiing Merkel Spar in Russia
The former US intelligence scientier Edward Snowden could also make statements statements in the late late headed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German federal prosecoffice could either ask questions in writing or also meet the 30-year-old in personally Russia Russia, the agency reported Interfax.
Previously, the Green en-undassociate Hans-Christian Ströbele had yesterday as the first German politician meet Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NASA revelations Reinpen FirCorporate paranoia over State surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On instructions from the German Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Anti-Terrorism (BVT), the German Internal intelligence Service, he should take ograph ograph the roof of the State Post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, the BT wanted to prove the existence of monitoring antenas, and the action led to a exchange of words between the US and the German State Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US did not use use of foreign espionage opportunities to to steal the business secrets of companies on behalf US companies, so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profits. ”
But since Edward Snowden, a former former employee who become a whistleblolower, began to publish his stuuring in US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders have no longer sure whether they can take the director at their word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has spied on Brazil s oil oil company Petrobas and obtained data from cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought corporate paranoia to a new high over state surveillance.
The barrel of w brought the revelation that Chancellor Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ phone has been woamp,, for for for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted target, then management agements are certainly also potential goals.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is possible that these data to be used for mutual benefit.
“ Germany must wake up, ” explains Oliver Grün, president of the BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US is now almost as much risk as China comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.
But the documents leaked by Snowden have not yet evidence that the US has passed the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU is short of certain IT and Internet opportunities and it should reduce its dependence on the US.
Businesses are sceptical about this.
The Bundestag has proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them slowly...
“ It does not work like that, ” says HHasso Plattner, chairman of the software software manufacturer SAP.
If you had wanted a strong European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die ish 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised Germany, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except except the IT industry.
Yet the scope and technical sophisticement of the US administrations, exposed by the Snowden rerererevelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest risk of spspying in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change, because European leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurislaw there and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a merchant institution, after the revelations of US data mining activities with prism, ten% of non-US-based members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP ’ Deputy CEO, says, “ We see a new question from customers who didn did not exist a year ago – it is: where will my data stored stored and can you guarantee that it will physiremain in this legal area? ”

On Wednesday, CentCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a set of guidelines for child food allergies at schools.

One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 18,, to CDC, between 1997 and 2007.

Intersexual children parents parents can choose for Gender Indefinite
Germany is the first European nation where have a third sex is for children who were born with ambiguous genitals.
Newborn ns are no longer rigiallocated to male or female.
Under the new law, parents no no longer have to declare gender for such children, but they can specify “ uncertain ” ” or “ undefined ” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to remove the pressure from parents so they do not have to make hasty decisions concerning operations for gender albution among newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person later later later, “ I am neither a man nor woman. ”
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, matilated and full of scars.
It estimated that one in ,000 ,000 children is born as a a boy a girl every year.
They are among intersexuals, a group that is diagnosed “ sexual differentiation disorder (DSD), a collcollella term for people with ypical chromosomes, artificial glands (ovaries or testic)) or usually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in in United States suggest that the best available information should be used on alalbution if a a provision is not possible and not wait for a child ’ psychological and physical development before before if any – choose an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr Jack Drescher, who has specialized in the problem of gender identification,, said the new German law “ “ es after a good thing. ”
Intersexual children children pose an ethical dilemma.
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical, but most children do not do so, ” he said.
You could perform a gender alassignment without an operation and then wait how the identity can evolve.
The scientific data on how a child develops develops or her gender identity are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it is.
It is like the secret of why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission stated that that intersexual people should be distinguished from trantranssexual or transgender persons, because their status is not gen-based, but due to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively or female, but typically defines both both simultaneously not not defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in subordinated sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hairs, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics characteristics as reproductive reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination against intersexual and transgender persons in working life and of the extent harassment, violence and prejudice criminminality.
Bowho do not consistent with the gender picture now have a special camp.
Meanwhile, it is and Nepal for adults for adults to to indicate male, female, or “ third sex ” on official documents.
In June, Australians Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the first “ “ “ less ” person ” after a court granted the life to of a “ undefined ” gender status.
Apart ongside M and W, German cards will have a third allocation in future, X for intersexu, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the tighdly Catholic country signed a petition calling that “ gender theory ” to be removed from textbooks.
The US Catholic Online website has also spoken out to German law on the ing, “ the world is dragged into a new state, where gender is a decision, but sexual sexual activity, we twiort two other pillars of civilization. ”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to the Baby zone that it would better better babbabies be allocated a sex at birth.
“ Parental ood is stressful enough even without further restrictions, especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your own child, ” said the parents ’ website.
Children must need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female female ales were called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive god who had both sexes.
Only ten years ago, medicine saw sex as something that could be wiped out and then rebuild.
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now questioned, after we know how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when up with the sex they assigned.
“ In the mid-20th century century it was called one psychiatric c emergency, ” Drescher said.
If such a child was born, then you called not not psypsychiatrist but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitals is ems from Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender sex be formable.
He shaped the term “ gender identity, ” and argued that social and environmental ingen– – how parents raise a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones, thereby thus coshaping whether a person considers to be male or female.
But, in a case known as “ John / Joan ” from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated during a botched circumcircumision ision, to caate the child completely, and to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of transformation transformation but which he was not, ” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male and married a woman.
With 38 however, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still some cians who would practice this model.
But in the 1990 ’ s, with the arrival of the Internet, survivors of these gender operations became public who are “ unhappy with the result. ”
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36 year year-old from from Montana, born XY Y chromosomes male but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large cliclitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man.
So his external organ and the testicles were surgically removed shortly after after birth in 1976 and he was brought up a girl.
He received female hormones at the age of 12.
“ I knew that I ’ not a a girl, ” he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unfortunate, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But, because he was depressed and knew that something was not right, he called for his medical files.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body to produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to the male identity, received Testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
He has become infertile through the operation.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called called Interface Project that intersexual people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing Director of the CaliforniAdvocfor Informed Choice law group group, ries ries that German law can “ stampamp and stigmatize. ”
“ Many activists are worried that the German decision may encourage parents to make swift decisions and algn to the child “ not fixed,, ” she explained.
We fear that will favour intervention.
We think that it would be better to assithe male or female sex and then wait.
But we do not yet know what the law will be, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, “ it allows adults to be recognised as the third sex. ”
“ Adults should be able to make their own choices about their legal sex, ” she explained.
German law is about assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to which to children young into at this time.
When they have grown up, they can decide their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene ene Baratz, a stradiologist from Pittsburg, who who had a daughter with a sexual differentiation order and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law “ empower” ” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with chromosomes male male, but but has a DSD called complete rogen resistance.
Due to the defect of recepeptdefect of the target cells for testoster, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie 29 is married;; is working at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatry ist.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to be to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“ The law gives room to parents, so they do not have to make hasty decisions, ” said Baratz.
It gives them the time to do different tests and sort things things, giving them them time before writing write “ male ” or “ female. ”
In this way everything is all right – you pull the child and loves it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy your parent's happiness.
And you do not need to ush for an operation that cannot be reversible.
“ This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are feeling because they think they are not doing the right thing, ” they explained.
Ultimately, the child decides the sex that that suits him better – and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own own decisions.

Rescommwith a the future
Actually WaltrautrauRies lives in fantasdream.
Your house is located in a residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green, an old grout, nice neighbours and also not lot of traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
" Hophope you are not afraid of spiders? " asks Waltraud Ries and points on a fat spider on the door frame.
I have for some some time for a new apartment for my husband and me.
However, you know, how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, not spispiphbia, but the concern that you longer longer handle the many steps steps to the house and in the flat at old age, she explains.
Furthermore: since a Meniscus operation, the fiffifties has had to know on her hand what it means to move from a floor andiandicap to floor.
She recently published a book book on the subject' Happily living in old age - What housing is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what cannot possible in old age', she starts to say.
When she moved more than 20 years ago with her husband to the maisonette apartment, it was simply a beautiful apartment right the the middle of greenery.
Today at the middle fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks thinks differently.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people to deal with the subject' living in old age'.
Most people them out it as long as as possible.
Old are only the others others,' she says smiling ing.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do one worry.
'Then it can be too late', said Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 models of living for a self-living living an old age.
'Which type of living, you choose, is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution does not exist for the age.
Even those who can afford the retirement itce in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that it might also become ill.
And:' Without a good knowledge of the national language, you can also united in the Dolce Vita,' says the book author to consider desire to resettate.
Among their models there find classic care models, alternative living of or or the often cited pensionner-WG.
In old age, their ticks and coks
'For me, such a dhabing would but nothing', she says with a wink.
Certainly not even like in a student ’ WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age you simply need your retreat retreat', said Ries.
The fact that a senior citizens' community can work work the the author does not want to it out.
But, then then to be different that in the classical student competition G.
And sometimes you just want want own rest,' she believes.
It is not alone in taking this view, at least in the national capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible' is also the experience TherTherRhuütten, head of the civiservice life at the age of the state capital.
Your services advises people on the topic of getting old'.
That is why older people would would often tolerwith inconvenience and restrictions, to be order to stay in their usual environment, that is the experience of the Foundation Warent est.
Today there are many ways to make the house or the flat without any barriers.
Ries recommends to all who are involved with the age-fitting fitting of their house or or for,, first themselves thorough information and not to hire the first best craftsmen.
Today there are also specialists specialists for fitting adapted to the age.
Even in the rental apartment some or things can be realized, and if it is only the increase of toilet seats, the interior designer clarifies.
But it is not always be existing apartment adapted to to old age and thus barrier-free barriers, however however beautiful it may be.
This was the experience experience of Waltraud Ries.
Although could be a stalift installed inside the apartment, which is also path paved with stairs way to the living door would be the much greater obstacle.
She will go on until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move it is gramore ying to her than before the spider on her living door.
America America to to suute Snowden
The US has not changed its stance to the former US intelligence contracer Edward Snowden.
He is also accused of having discloslicit secret information.
So he has to face face criminal proceedings in the US, said the US State Department spokesman, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent Snowden ’ recent statements would nothing change change either.
Previously, the German Green politiHans-Christian Ströbele e, after meeting with Snowden in Moscow, appealed to the US not to threaten him any further any punishment.
Psaki stressed out that Ströbel ’ s remarks were those those of a parliament and not those of a German member of the government.
Intelligence intelligence üer Edward Snowden is prepared to to a with the German authorities.
First, however, he wants his situation his be clarified.
The former NSA employee who was was for the the, has made this clear in an unaddressed letter that the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published Friday after a meeting with Snowden and directed to the Federal Government, Bundestag and the General General General.
The letter reads as following following a translation published by Ströbele:
To the Responers
I have been asked to write to you regarding your investigation into mass surveillance.
I am called Edward Joseph Snowden, and was been contracor or a direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the States.
In my worked in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government, prompted me of a moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I faced a a serious and persistent rage that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance to my political action both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of comprehensive surveillance system that is not able to anyone, as a service to public.
These spying revelations ations produced many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these knowledge are becoming increasingly clear, at the same time taken have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was proven positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a fificiary, and striires to criminalise and prosecprosecof political expression.
Yet, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with support from the international community, will abandon this damaging attitude.
I hope that once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will will be able to participate involved in the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made made in the media, in with with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to talking to you in your country country soon as the has been clarified, and I thank for your efforts to to with international law, which is protecting us all.

Looking ancy ice cream that shup in the dark?
A British entrepreneur developed the first ice shice in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine foods and creating a shining feak.
He came to the idea after reading a research into jjellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to produce the shining protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consum, which increasing the pH value in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the ice responacts to the warmth in the mouth and shine up so the more you licks, the lighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I'm Delicious, ” says, “ The product is incredible, but still in a very early of production, and you get two grams of it for 200 pounds. ”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein the pH value increases increases and the ice shines.
We have tested it in recent months and and it seemed ideal to bring it available to Halloween, because it has this wonderful light effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever ever, because the shellorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball cket costs me about 140 pounds.
But for do so, it tastes delicious.
Charlies's experimental st-based company is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, ‘ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream ’.
This is impossible in itself, because to the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make of ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way of creating it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
TSV Morsum is after six six days and without no point in the the League association ue.
Right right now, the Ingo Ehlers ’ team will tomorrow tomorrow the Derby against TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.

DaDaden, Daverden focuses on game of speed.
Therefore, we must keep keep our error rate low.
However, it is important is increase increase coverage coverage which has recently recently left anything but a safe impression.
A much more relaxed is is Daverden ’ Coach Thomas Panitz after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that we us far not the favorite, because everything can always happen in the Derby.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to up in Morsum to start a series.

Halloween 2013: In Figures
When I was small, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, up late and guise us for the neighbourhood.
Today I have become more a halloween potper.
Over the last two years, have not been prepared to to distribute swesweets from my home and I am will not do so this year.
But, according to statistic, am a black sheep with regard to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million, to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and decoration,, the Association Retretailers (NRF).
One thing that which I look forward forward to every Halloween after again is the trend values.
The costumes will amount about 1.2 1.2 of the the $6.9 billion spent, the NRF.
This year, witting unanimated objects are the last scream.
Women no longer longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now embody ductive food such as pizza, hamburger or carrots.
As for men I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the the shat punk space will will it in this year's instagram feeds.
According to Google, the most popular costumes umes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dresguup our dogs last year and, to my surprise we were not alone.
Indeed, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes of their pets, says the NRF.
These are a lot of " hot dogs ".
As regards sweets, we are squsquashish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on this, according says The Nielsen Company.
This is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, slickers, swedies and rubber bears.
So good news for the US Department of Commerce, 41 million people who move ve through the quarter with the “ sweet or sures ” saying.
Indeed, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween, and – let ’ s delude ourselves.
The only thing we do not to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilogramof it are sold around Halloween, according to the National of SweectionManufacturers.
That is about nine billion corize grains.
It is a mystery that I have not yet to solve.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses in which it sputes.
They have great names like ‘ Terror Behind the Walls ’ (which is actually in a real prison), ‘ Howl-O cream ’ and ‘ The House of Shock ’.
There are indeed 1,200 officially spuck houses in the United States that earn $500 million dollars proceeds, to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you are pyourself yourself in your pants and then your friends on Facebook, where you are not get again and then leave comment to the type you stand on like “ nice nice expression ’.
But let us finally to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us with the Great Pumpkin when we were children and the carving of a umpkin kin tern is like the decorof the Christmas tree – something that we made from a small age.
Fortunately, the “ baby in the umpkin ” trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up by craching the pumpkin and not to sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $6 million on pumpkins, the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lattern, which slowly rotts in the front garden, probably from from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and ve something nice from their 92kloo pumpkin.
Hing fire in HelmLight: RescucuHHred corpse
The fire brigade had to leave in Helmbrecht on late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on Friday night.
The rescue services bdge a charcorbody from the house.
Rescue have found a charred corpse in a three-family house during a fire in helmet bralight.
Whether it was a inhabitant was still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
Llate Thursday evening it was burnt on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire department arrived, the flames already out of a window.
The staff forces went to the apartment and found the body in a single room.
This and and other room were burned ned ned completely.
The entire ground floor has been damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police Speman explained.
For the moment the building was no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not initially clear.
Germany ’ s largest state church has a open arts in to advertise the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible parish lack shortency: the Evangelant Lutheran State Church of Hanover calculates that the number of currently 1,800 past800 pastors will halve by half to the current situation by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers prospects for the future, Pastor MaMathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the daily and for themselves.
For the first time, the Landeskirche for the first time commissioned a full pastor to ire young people for the study of theology.
At present, fewer and young people choose to study theology after their their Abitschool.
Burfien this this this to the process of decectenfication: " God's s voice is quiet, the world is loud ".
Yet, profession profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my appointary and can set my priorities where I think to important.
Pastors could be very close to the people as souors ors.
They earned as much as teachers teachers and could well well from it.
To be sure, the free economy will pay more, but the theologians would have a safe employer.
This benefits today ’ s young people, who are not just about careers but but full work.
According to the Provincial Church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, currently about 60 pastors currently retiring per year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree are starting their secretariat.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas, such as Harin, the Emsland or the Wendland, find it difficult to fill to fill future.
Burfien also intended to organise study days for young people, and also to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The course of theology ology offers a broad education.
You can even become the President of the Germany.

Fire brigade save a pudy that sat anded at 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous prourdge in a quarry.
CockerSpanish's bitch Ruby had run away after a minor road accident.
Three days later it was discovered in her pmal location by by walwalker in the quarry.
Fire men roped led on the roff wall and saved the dog from safe death.
The fire department was able in bringing a puch to safety, was seanded in a rock wall on a 15 meter high margin.
The nine-month old ckerSpanspanish bitch, Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone her own before she was saved from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall 20, who owns the dog, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to revisit Ruby and to thank the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperdesperately looking for their bitch and published ces for help on social networks when she had ran into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
At around 14: 15 on Wednesday, a walker who running his dog saw saw the stranded ruby on the 15 meter high section in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of Cleckheaton Fire Fire Station hed to the and rusped off to rescue Ruys, who was then transported upup in a dog debox.
Andy Clayton, technical technical rescue specialist, said: “ She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock ff – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move muscle during saving rescue – she was like stiff frozen.
But now it is doing well well.
She then eaten a few dog -cakes.
That was a quite unusual station.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, the specialist in the technical rescue team, said, “ Ruby had a huge accident. ”
There was a possibility that she might been very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the vinary surgeon, but he found nothing except of exhaustion and dehygenation.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire said, “ Watch eing on the ed salthe rescue. ”
I couldn not even believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them in the arms.
The vindoctor said that, if exhaustion had become too great and it had sed, it would probably have collapashed.

George Kerevan: European Unbundling Let the Scots choice
A new day, a new story of horrors to independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will be required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This is the key word for stories about passport passport checks in Berwick and a barbed wire border border HHrian ’ s wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the possible economic benefits that more free movement would bring bring in the rest of Europe, but this did not – – expected relevant in the headlines.
Nor has no one mentioned that EU member states often bend bend their strict rules when it is more able for them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area now, the continued disregard for Brussels would be be a small concession exchange for what they really want from the Scots.
So it is not a a story.
And one that has come so in the years that it already like a fossil: for the first time I heard heard the ‘ independence means controls ” duck, at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is being lost when the repetition of this ancient history old history.
Why should we expect expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European pipe?
Why exchange London London London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
That is the real European news: the great plan post-post-war plan to unite Europe has come to a halt.
With the euro crisis, the European project has officially dead.
Across the EU, parties are gaining ground that are hostito the EU or want to abandon the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurooskeptic Alternative for Germany – – founded only this year – could win close under five million votes in September ’ s s federal election, thereby effectively driving elling the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in conjunction with the straitjacket into which national economies are are forced by adhercking to the single currency, many believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to to do with national governments causing excessive fiscal deficits – which was true only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pailed ed its members on exchange rates that are tageous to German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave so.
Without the possibility of depreciation of the local currency, southern Europe finds itself itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage relative to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spspspted by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code to subsidisFrench French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice, compared with the United States, electricity electricity and times that for gas.
This is a paralypling cost cost row, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage setpments in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is rising, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle that which Germany Germany in bay and put Paris on an footing with Washington.
But Berlin needs no more than a gateway to political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic policies, which the troubled French economy is strules.
The result: Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing, anti-EU National National Front has just won a decisive post-election, thus eging the ruling Socialists to third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely timely warning to British Labour Party that it cannot expect a division on the right would automatically bring benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with their newly won popularity among the white ites of the working class?
It wants to use next year's s next elections to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is very possible – then such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing enttiment of the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more more more of the “ Europe of (sovereign) nations ” that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold stuck to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering up with the US.
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain alone alone be be in the Atlantic rain.
Where has Scotland left all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in last consequence) little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – one that includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can bothemselves to where.
I suspect that Scotland could do well in a looser European group,, if we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other, simile-thinking countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider consider doing the same with Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, remarkingly, – the most successful political movement against Europe ’ s austerity austerity, and won a spectacular majority in 2011, through the rejection of the proposed (and)) cuts made by Labour Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Demcoalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to then have a austerity policy imposed from Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing Up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend tend to reach puberty rather than than their white peparts, as research shows.
Physical Change is Not Direct Direct Puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that epidemic obesity has what gered early puberty.
The Ler Pubercent Tent among Young
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is growing breasts and shamhair when she age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the Children ology Association of American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida Florida, the Pediatric enddoocrinologist, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a norm.
“ I spend a lot of time reuring parents – this is usually no sign that puberty is is coming fast, ” explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious indications of the development, such as growing breasts, shame and armple hair, and body odsmell, are shown in girls earlier.
Nevertheless there was only a slight slight shift in age of menarche (appearance of first diseding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, a little less than 12.75 in 1970.
“ When the development of breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years until the menarche, ” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book book “ Early puberty in girls: The essential advisselor how to deal with this recuroccurring problem ”.
Time is the most accurate test of puberty progresses.
It is controversial about what is is the beginning of puberty, but it is “ preprsty ” if breast enlargement is accompanied by a boost in growth before an eight year age.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatriatrician can vise closely.
With faster progress, tests may be shown by an dicronologist, order to to eliminate serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatment methods used delaying early menstruation and to off another consequence: the premature ageing of bones, can ultimately lead to growth in growth and thus to boly growth in adults.
The recommendations for medicative or hormonal therapy are on the age of the child, the speed of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is relucid about medication, but he admits, “ The pression of puberty can alleviate problems of behavior and the feelings of girls, unlike being their companiparts. ”
The other major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
“ They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how how are handle the hygienic side, ” said Kaplowitz.
“ It was a shock, ” remalls a woman whose daughter with ten days got her days.
Although there were some signs signs signs and we had talking about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school, because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories on the causes of early puberty.
But there is no concluevidence that hormones are be cause in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
Boys come to puberty, much to girls did.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls between the age of nine that establishing a link between body fat and entry to puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white white members.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems influenced by all kinds of things, from economic conditions, climate climate to genes.
Another puery: even though boys facial and shamic hair has already growing earlier, the trend towards full-flety early puberty is not strong as it is for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference highlighted the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and shamhair is common even among babies and infants.
“ We must be careful careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pedipediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“ This can mean that you will have to hold a conversation earlier than expected ”, ” said Kaplowitz.
If you remain calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early on need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs sooner than than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue argue about seat width the face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the range of tourer-class seats on long-haul flights, which the tone of a bitter lash lash this month ’ s Dubai Airshow.
The dispute is about the seat width that is offered to passengers on long flights in the economy class – not always the the airlines airlines the most, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SASAS and Boeing Co..
Airbus called this week for an industry standard that requires a width of at least 46 cm (18 inch) in the economy class,, but the US archririval Boeing says saying it is the airlines to decide.
The distation comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – – especially whether there are rows of nine or ten seats is crucial for the economic results indicated to deliver by the new “ mini-Jumbo ” design.
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 777X ” holds 406 people in economy class class seats that are over 17 inches wide, thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 350 in 18 ininch seats in the economy class, with there nine nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share bings about technical details by means advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus is appeals before the Dubai Airshow show where the 77X is expected to appeal to the public with a event of more than 100 orders.
The company recently presented an ad that could well be the beginning of a new ad ity war and that donors could showed a picture of three people squeeled together in a restaurant, with the title: “ Would you accept that? ”
“ Boeing proposes proposing haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props, ” says Airbus Sales Director John Leahy.
As eating etary habits change, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970 ’ s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journeys, at the end of the century, the average American's weight increased by 10% between 40 40-49, as data from the United States Health Department.
The waist range of the average American American in the 21st century, according to US health statistics, 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that its rival adherto to a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body range of the freshly-apaptized Jet Set was smaller.
Studies was conducted out Airbus conducted, which showed that one additional (2.54 cm)) per seat increased the sleeping quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes the Airbus' figures on the seat sizes and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines organise the balance between air tariffs and facilities.
The company also explains that according to to, the experience on the aircraft depends on more than than the seat width.
‘ It really really ils down to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe they need in order to be successful, ” explains the air cabin expert, Kent Craver from Boeing.
They do not want us to dictate them what makes them profitable.
They know their their business better than anyone else.
It is about increasing more elof elfor passengers, but for manufacturers, it is becoming a issue that can impact on sales.
Behind the confrontation is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least USD 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July July, the seating layout is the driving force behind the battle over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain a 20 percent more efficiency per seat their latest twtwin-engine long-design than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements about the results partly depend on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per series series to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than with machines currently used use, with ten seats per row.
“ Boeing is squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products ” says Kevin Keniston, Head of passenger comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full ten seat per row cabins at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for a closer order, which could come with cheaper fares.
“ Eighty inch inch width would be great passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view the Airbus offer is driven by the threat posed by the 777, ” says Mary Kirby, expert in cabin cabin equipment, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world traveling jet vendellers even even a band of measurements in order to measure the competitive situation.
Even if they praise the comfort, all the manufacturers also also offer highly comdensed jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater rows, but it said not has not sold sold.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of greater adaptability of the cabins and of offering seats on the corridways for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that calls for a new industry standard is likely to flporate but but distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could koff the pleasure smoking pleasure.
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotaddiction for a lifetime.
More tests are needed before testing on humans, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York has said that the initial results were good.
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers, who have tried to quit trying trying all the methods available on the market, have experienced that that their cotcotaddiction is stronger than these approaches ” said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which produce produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chunt the nicotine molecules ules the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, whereby a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice administto nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
Mce without vaccination, however, have taken “ time-out, ” researchers explained, a sign sign the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the magazine Science Translational Medicine.
Premer tobacco vaccines failed to ed, because they contained antibodies.
Vaccines had to be given so often to to maintain antibody level that they was expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably be significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, if a future vaccine for humans for,, safe safe could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But is more likely likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“ They know: when they start to smoke again, they no longer feel any because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them overcome their habit, ” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denthat he was influenced by Obeid
Against former laboratory party minister, Joe Tripodi of New South Wales, an investigation by corruption investigation investigation is being launched.
The former NSW minister disputes that he amended the the on leleased arrangements at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had covert t eholdings in three properties on a state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has expanded Friday investigations on on Friday to investigate whether Obeid has influenced ministers of state to extend lease ases at Circular Quay, where Obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe after they ended in August 2005.
Now it is investigation on the charge that Tripodi had known of Obei’ s covert interest in the land, after Tripodi's former deputy staff chief Lynne Ashpole said accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government pushed urged public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against this and and also wanted longer running times.
In 2009, leleases for CirCircular Quay companies that brought the beibei$ 2.5 million per year, were extended without public tentender.
Tripodi, who was Port Minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted in favour of public procurement.
But he denied to make made the at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pressed for a restructuring of the government's lelease.
A telephone record submitted to ICAC showed showed talks in August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripopodi and Steve Dunn, a senior who moved to the Port Department after working in the Fisheries Agency under Obeid.
‘ Was the issue discussed in these telephone calls been the drawing up of commercial lease arrangements? ’ asked asked Deputy Commissioner, Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“ No, ” Tripodi replied.
I do not remember what was discussed discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes attack targettargets in Syria, official official sources
Israeli fighter planes had attacked Thursday night on a target in the Syrian port Latakia akia and a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the aim was, but said said it had been at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was target was Russian SA-5 missickets.
Israel has already conducted air strikes on missile deliveries missimissideliveries at least twice this year.
Foreign workers with 445 visas could undergo ‘ genuine test ’ ’
Within the framework of enhanced measures, the government is considering a ‘ authenticity test ’ for foreign workers with 445 visas.
If the test is introduced, it would via a criterion for use that would prevent the 457 from being used to fill unsafly jobs or as a back door for bringing ating family and friends to Australia.
A proposed discussion of the government was published today after the government ’ former former members, Maxine McKew, condemned the the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be regarded as an ult by Australia ’ s neighbors.
“ Louong statements like as “ foreigners should back behind, ” and “ hire ans first first ” are a very unpleasant setression in times when when unions were demanding a protected market, ” she she the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region region paralyze an echo of this historic artefact, I would not be surprised.
The proposed for outoutlines lines twelve measures were plat by former immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on trafficking in human beings, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are under considered.
If the ‘ authenticity criterion ’ is adopted, then someone who applies for a visa could be checked in order to that ‘ the application is genuine in those cases where the applicant is related or related to the owner or a relevant person of the supporsupporting company ’.

As Scottish State of State Alistair Carmichael commented, “ The announcement today is good news for Scotland. ”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called CarCarchchael to “ unequivocally ” for Scottish integration in the HS2 network.
Brown said, “ The high-speed rail link has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but also as Scotland ’ s economic might provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK. ”
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, is providing benefits for all and complements the GlasGlasow-Edinburgh Edinburgh link the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the report into the investigation with British ministers next year and to to together together on the next steps.
Regulations on aircraft equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to shut off tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts efforts in the US to relax the rules on such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read e-books, watch, watch or play videos during critical flight phases, if they are in “ flight mode. ”
During the majority of the flight are already allowed to do so, but many people it annoying that they allowed to read their e-books when taktuoff and landing.
However, Australian companies observe the decision to implement which US airlines have to do a amounts of work, but are not no immediate plans to change their rules.
The air traffic Authority CASA declared that they would look at the announcement, but pointed sized that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases still apply in Australia.
‘ CASA does not currently have specific rules on the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft ’, was announced.
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already had a talks with CASA about extend the use of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and says that they is open to change, but these must be initiated by lawors.
“ We would welcome a review of CASA's approval of electronic devices, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after now offering (wireless entertainment) during the flight, ” said one speaker.
Qantas said that it will with the current rules for further notice.
“ Our current directives provide that electronic equipment may not be used at startuoff and landing, and we do not currently have plans to change that, ” the company said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that that passengers benefit passengers and we will certainly look very closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects American companies companies varies depending to the age of the fleet.
They need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate mobile phone radio rupces and to change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programmes and customer instructuring.
“ Once a airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it allows passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers, and smartartphones of any height, ” announced the FAA.
In rare cases at poor visibility, the crew will instrucpassengers passengers to switch off the devices during landing.
The group also recommended storing heaviheavier at starstart-and landing safely under the seat seat or the compartments over the seats.
Prior to the landing area against Schalke, BVB B ilers travelling with light missihad provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced severe consequences from this.
Before the Friday day match of the football Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual familiar almost ghostly acoustic, offered offered the viewer, just shortly before the kfifioff of the ligliga between the vicvice-champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
The audience mostly mainly the guest fans with their vocsongs.
The the,, contrast contrast, where the most faiof the faial - and loudest - BVB fans are stand, initially initially itself ordinexceptionally quiet: no chan, no no battle calls.
The pedestal of Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common beginning, remained unoccupied.
And at the front front of the stand there was was a a a big flag with marked " Stadium ban bition section ".
Only as goalkeeper novel Weidenfeller as usual as the first BVB to take the place, sparked short-lived jubering.
When his team colleagues followed, there were louoant singing and wing scarves - but far from from everywhere.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 12 and 13 in tribune.
Also, the stadium speakers Norbert Dickel once listed the positive experiences of the last few days - erbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by coach Jürgen Klopp - this did not cause a whiour.
Only five minutes before the fistle the Capo gains its pedestal - and the tension until then almost almost almost tangible tangible elescapes in a loud screry when Dickl intered as usual, the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
Finally, as always, it was the turn of the south - and finally here was again as usual was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at latest when with Anfififf the South tribune the loud call " Derbysieger stands up ", everything was as always.
The silence silence was probably a response to the events of the last few days.
Immeditly before vierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the travelling BVB trailers had fired red into into the audience range and to the square - almost hit gokeeper eper novel Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed ed ated because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the heads of the Dortmund ’ Ulin his office in the – - and according if Watz’ s words, the believed, this was rather a rather unconvenient date for the fan representatives.
" There will be massive cuts for the whole of the trmovement movement, " the BVB Boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure WWatzke banned Ultras from a choreography for home match against the VfB Stuttgart.
" I have banned that, " he explained.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy regards pyrotechnics.
Moreover, the Ultras various various ways of punishment were revealed - by Tuesday they now have the time to choose one.
Otherwise, Watzke says, the BVB will impose sanctions by the end of next week.
" This will be radical " " insured Watzke.
We may be interested to see what the reactions in the south in the will be.
Pousouses booming in Singapore as the Middle-Class Crisis arrived
In a plillhouse in Bendememeer min Singapore Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden wet, a ring and a pair of earearrings to pay their daughters ’ school fees.
“ My husband and I have just bought a house, all all my money in it, ” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earned and worked 3,000 Singapore dollar (about €1,730 every month as a member of an administrative worker, the family income is not monthly family income, she explains.
Indeed, demand is demand in parts of theast theast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so that ValueMax, where it it changed its exchange, week became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore ’ s stock exchange.
Popleof jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollar in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but is almost as as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, mortenhouses in Singapore demand an effective annual of 17%, just just above the 15.4% required by the United Overseas Bank, require a local lender with a subsidiary in the same mall.
However, mortateouses offer the advantage that no verification of credicreditworthiness or income is required required, is why loans loans be possible ququickly than at banks.
As a result, millions of people in the region turn to manouses, as families feel the pressures of the rising cost of living, and rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit, owing to loose fiscal policies in the developed economies, families with lower and middle-incomes are are into manouses to make the difference in a faltering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's s growing household debt, mainly through increasing mortgages, as a a risk factor for the credit rating of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, the Agency estimates to have the highest household debt in Asia as a ratio of GDP.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, with increase of 60% still in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about Thailand ’ s high consumer debt, which this week week just out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued weakness in exports and a fall in consumer demand.
“ Ultimately, this means that, as costs costs rising, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their their income wherever possible, ” says Song Seng Wun, economist ist CIMB,, a bank in Malaysia.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have exacerbfied the trend toward pledging personal belongings, as people seize the opportunity to turn the family's jewelery into cash.
In Singapore, about 70% of the pledged items are in the 200 paiehouses of the City state.
People say to themselves, “ The gold price looks good, let ’ s plegrandmother ’ s gold chain and recover back next month. ”
The largest Thai Pfgage house operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a% increase in customers in recent months in its branches.
Growth in deposit deposits is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the branch branch in Bendemeer and 15 other one in Singapore, to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, Yeah Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company finances this at 60% of the Singapore 66 million dollar that it was IPpublic in Singapore this week.
While some lenders were in the crossfire for high interest rates, Yeah explains that mortateouses not only offer offer lower interest rates than other lders, but do not directly increase the debt.
“ Customers lend objects that they already own, and liquefeffication of personal value does not increase the household debt, ” she explains.
PfPflending business is increasingly being socially accepted as short-term, inssecured financing.
Nor are not everyone people use borloans loans in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, yielthem up to 60% of the price in cash.
To us us are customers from every social layer.
“ This includes wealthy who lend in the short term for a business or an investment, or small businesses having must bridge cashashflow bottlenecks, ” says Yeah.
Sometimes, they just just need money very quickly.

Bailout over $325 million Australia's Asimanan care
The Australian government is insisting on the tough conditions associated with the $325 million bailout Australia for Tasmanan health care in order to ensure that state ’ s government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health for Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate measures ” to prevent a crisis caused by an aging population ’ the island state, a higher of chronic disease, and systemic restrictions.
Fundfinancing for a period of four years was decided upon following government consultations with the independent Tasmanan deputy, Andrew Wilkie.
“ The government has put together an emergency rescue package that, in our view, addresses the unique challenges faced by the state, ” Plibersek today.
The $35-million package amountotto $31 million in emergency aid for election services.
With further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for to cataracts, resiresidues are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, aftercare after in-patient stays, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of an electronic record of data system in local hospitals.
“ These investments are consistent with the ideas that clinic workers affected me me said that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanic health care system ” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on strict reporting reporting and accountability by the Tasmanic government.
The state must maintain the current level of financing in to obtain money from CommCommwealth wealth and report monthly on where the additional funds was spent.
A three-person commission will be established and to ensure that the state state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would do little little if “ it are not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmanpublic health care system on a more sustainable course. ”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state s public health health system from the care list, ” said Wilkie.
According to the state government, these electoral outwill largely largely up for the recent cuts.
But the health policy spoof opposition at the level, Peter Dutton, believes that today announcement today is only a “ paving solution. ”
“ We are in today today because the Laborab s government government has ted $430 million from the health system, ” he said to ABC TV.
It cannot allow a state government to to take almost half billion billion out of the system and insert the Commonwealth 300 million and then pretas that it is good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to that not a single dollar of the rescue package be spent on extra bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons weapons, says a Monitoring Group
Syria has destroyed key chemweapons manufacturing facilities and basd gas munition tions, the Global Chemical Weapons Control Group declared on, while serious clashes in the north's north near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been since the beginning of the civil war, soon three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Bbition of Chemicals (OPCW) came one day before the deadline.
November 1,, which by Damascus, based in The Hague, had set to destroy all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities or make them inoperoper’, including all machines for mixing chemicals to popoison gas and to fill ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the elimination of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.
Destdestruction ating the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there has about 1,000 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the arin arin nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when there was fighting taking place in the city of Safira on Thursday when experts are saying that there is a chemical weapons production facility and storage,, as the UK-based SyriSyrian Human Rights Observatory has indicated.
The activist group, is uting the number of a via of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government, 29,954 of them were ed of the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-militters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were were army soldiers soldiers deserted 202 and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict in this conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country.
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting for weeks for weeks in Safira, many of which have links to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but not mention any details.
The fighting underscore the danger that chemical-weapons inspectors are facing, because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic toxic weapons arsenal is a race against the time amid a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team is “ now convinced that that has has seen the major production and mixed filling facilities facilities by Syria mentioned and witnessed their destruction. ”
Therefore, “ there is no plans for further inspection inspections. ”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said that they had completed completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
Because of safety concerns, it two was was not to two possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPWC WC declared according to Syrian statement, the two sites had been been abandoned … and the the objects of the chemical weapons programme there been reloctransferred to other named facilities that were inspected. ”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the the two facilities the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has presented a plan for completely destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month the OPWC OPWC Executive Committee.
“ I salute the bravery and the courage courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation, ” explained Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director General of the Monitoring, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebbels have been fighting civil war against Assad ’ s government and their security forces, which which many members of AlaAlawites, been for a secession of Shia Islam.
In view to further developments, the head of observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Fray at Judict on Bali Bombers
Survors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing in 2002 in 2002 reanany at the the judgment of the last of the tigators to trial, because they believed Umar Patek should be shot by law.
Patek, who spent almost ten years as one of the most sought wanted for refugees in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for for in the construction of exploves for the bomb attack.
If he were suspended, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder ination of the attack ault on two nightclubs in the popular popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died died including 88 88 Australians and many many were injured.
A ilt was also found in a number of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecprosecutor had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have sought death death penalty for the man who as a masterbombomb builfor reputation, also also called as “ “ demotion tion Man. ”
The decision aroked painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 3ty-year year-old twin brothers, Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Tattle with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think that he should follow in the other guys ’ footsteps.
“ You should put him before a firing command, ” said Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day that I I will get any more grandchildren and I never see my daughters ters.
The Sari Club was razed the earth, when a massive bomb exploded on after October October 12 October 2002 in a parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded ded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into the coma for one month after the attack and “ died ” three times while hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas, and Imam Samudr– who were responsible for the bloodbath, who were executed four years ago.
In ally, this type should have the death penalty before everyone else.
To eping him alive – no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years after he has killed 202 and hurt many hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the bo bombers stand in trial.
He withdrew nearly a decade of arrest, but was was picked up in January Pakistan in the city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where US forces killed barely four months later Al Qaeda ’ s former chief, Osama bin Laden.
During the negotiation, an FBI agent testithat intelligence intelligence reports had signted that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden with the aim of restoring the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“ He did not stand up, ” said Corteen.
Until recently, he showed no rerets at how much suffering he inflicted on other people.
The judgment was delivered prior the ten-year anniversary of this year ’ s attack with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
“ There will be many tears this year, ” said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on aircraft (but not mobile phone calls)
Passengers can now travel from departure to landing use their electronic equipment for reading, working, play, listen to music and watch movies, but not on a mobile phone, to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depdepend on the respective airline, FAA staff Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines need to to the FAA that aircraft are forming with the new directives and that they have updated air crew' training manuals and the stberal rules in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were the Delta Delta and JetBlue.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could very able authorthe the use of electronic devices very soon, ” the FAA announced in a announcement.
Currently, passengers must to turn smartphones, tablets, and other other liances off when aircraft doors are closed.
They may only take off again once the aircraft reaches an altitude of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When passengers enter the landing, passengers must turn it off and must not not take off before the aircraft has landed.
According to the new directives airlines whose aircraft are are protected against electronic malruption could allow their passengers to use the equipment even on take-off, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA explained.
Most new the new and other other planes planes converted to to use of Wi-Fi at higher heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the professional Association of Professional cabin attendants, welcomed the changes.
“ If the new regime is safely implemented – and we are closely with the airline on this regard – both sides will benefit from it, ” Glading said.
We are, frankly, tired of feeling like watchors on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections to surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or downloading of of data under three kilometres were still prohibited, explained the Authority.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So is still no “ Words With Friends, ” SScrabble online game that actor Alec Baldwin on his 2011 phone his smphone in 2011 when he had effectively publicto leave a jet of American American Airlines because refused to shut off the device while the aircraft was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stored here as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cab.
Mobile calls during the flight, also remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies ts with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic equipment take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker said by said by the National Transportation Safety Board that safety experts in national traffic issues on CBS News said that mobile phones were still be as a risk.
“ Mobile phones are are a problem, not only because they could cause potential disturbantions in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air air can also disrupt mit transmission masts, ” Rosenker said.
An industry ’ s advisory committee, created by the FAA to examine issue, recommended recommended last that that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been pressure on the FAA to relax restrictions on use.
Critics such as democratic senator Claire McCaskill, in Missouri argue that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of equipment has become uuquitous.
In some studies it is said that up to a third of passengers forgets or ignores the closure of the device.
The FAA in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers following the reports of disturbances in navigation and communication communication equipment by passengers FUKM radios, which represented the latest trend in technology.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electric systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed in a manner approved by the FAA that electronic interferdo not for them.
Airlines airlines have provided wi--passengers for several years when their altitude is reached.
The airplanes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new, said Huerta.
Today ’ s electronic devices generally provide much less radio broadcasting than previous generations.
E-example, e-Reader, only minimal radiation radiation you flitover.
However, when downloading or sending data, transfer values are stronger.
Among the defenders of a relaxation of the restrictions for the device's use by passengers counts Amazon.com.
In 2011, corporate officials loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and did a test flight to identify problems, but not detect them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee have expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said said that he believed that the discaused by the equipment is genuine even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only very isolated reports from pilots who speak for disrupance of aircraft systems through the equipment, most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended to the FAA to allow pilots to order the landing under poor visibility to to switch off the equipment by passengers.
A group in the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable accommodation for travellers who are now well equipped with technology.
“ We are pleased that FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not inconflict with security, ” ” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Uned of rescued by rescue from the North Sea drig.
A bird ffed to the coast by air rescue service, had been exhausted on a North Sea driisland, was released back into nature.
The water rp was flown to Aberdeen helicophelicoplast month, where it was was ed up by the Scottish organisation SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said, “ This waterral was probably a wintry migratory bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea. ”

Are Europe ’ elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain started in April with the intention to bring the economy around the table and define what those who provide wealth and prosperity in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy, and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business executives who map roughly Britain ’ s corporate sizes, sectors, and regions.
The results of the poll will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside Europe and focus on countries that modernise and grow, while states in the EU are stagnate.
They would like the government to favornew new trade links with countries as China, India and Brazil, rather than stding with the long and demanding process of reformthe obscure EU institutions.
Wed by their view on certain legal issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was widespread discontent with the internal market because, according to the companies, the cost of the Brussels rules would outweithe benefits of of part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40% of the large companies agreed, which traditionally traditionally the most propro-European.
Finally, and this says probably most says, our consultation of economic leaders found that a clear majority wants the UK to want a course towards changing of the, and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This insight, which occurs from companies of all sizes and leaders, shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the action agenda back to the UK.
It is at stake – change ing the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16% of a change opinion in favor of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate Britain ’ s conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renotiation to a significant shift in the balance of power power to the Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible, and increasingly necessary, as the eurozone now moves toward a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth growth in Britain, as the result of our survey shows shows greater attention means for companies on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels ’ s approach to regulation.

Hearation before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff charged of accusations against Jonathan Lord for sex offences.
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) have been charged of sex offences in related with children, in 2011, charges were made child child care Jonathan Lord Lord Caringbah, as the Royal Commission on Children SexSexAbAbuse.
But, in the pre-Commission opening statement, the YMCA had declared “ “ the organization had had had had to do with an incident of child sexual abuse. ”
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case where a YMCA employee had been accused of using child pornography offences and another in which a sports teacher CA Sports YYCA CaringbHall convicted 1991 1991 for using children sted to him.
Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, said that he knew about the first case, but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA ’ s opening opening declaration to the Commission was also imprecaccurate in claiming “ “ there were external reviews by the YMCA where the YMCA was recognized as the forefront of child safety. ”
Evidence before the Commission shows that YMCA has been informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Hare, with 21 with the YMCA, admitted that management had failed to hihire Lord “ ‘ from me downdown ’ and did not not ensure that staff were aware their obligations to report violations of the child safety directives.
Lord had been convicted in early this year for sexual offences to twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
But Hare argued that the YMCA had have a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Lords ’ s aches regarding children ’ child safety.
The staff said they had observed infringements, among other things, Lord Lord alone with children, looked them privately as babysitter, had them sit on his lap, one saying that he loved it, had children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior ander was Lord, and who asked for training on child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service officer Jacqui Barnat, who was the suppreme Lords at the YMCA ingbah, was “ intimidating and very innearby. ”
The managing director said that he would not accept statements by employees that that they had not dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship their friendship with Lord diminaffected their judgement, which is why they did not report him.
Hare explained that he had told the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson the organization must draw from the “ “ Jonathan Lord incident ” “ not concern the reporting ” by employees, and the board agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to urge staff to sign their secrecy shortly after the allegations occurred occurred was taken by the managing director of YMCA children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of evidence, but this has been ‘ over-zealous ’ and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a a safe organization JonJonathan Lord was working there in the there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert child child sexual abuse, told the Commission.
He explained that there had been “ serious problems ” in hirecruitment, review, appari,, training and supervision.
The hearing has been postponed until 20 December.

According to tionary indicates egeganism is to vegetarianism, but is different in a significant way.
Because, while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cts, ice ice or a vigorous dam dam, these feacies are not not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to abanding meat and fish, the vegan disins from from consumption animal products products and honey is also rejected.
What remains, one might wonder, but on closer inspection, the vegan etary world is characterised by considerable ingenuity.
" Breadspreads are very popular ", explains Ute Henkelmann, the is owner of the local Reform house, who offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also also visit the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, New Zealand and-born vegan, has been living, in Lampertheim he he (almost) everything everything he needs to live alive. " In 1997 I switchanged my diet and became vegetarian ".
At the turn of the century the next step step and I became vegan.
" The conviction was not not only about the diet but also of the shoe choice, " says Proctor, who fers artificial leather over normal leather.
He recognized that it also works in other everyday issues without animal products.
In and foremost, vegan is an ethic.
" I don't want animals to die for me ", Proctor explains the maxim of vegans, which covers all consumption behavior.
Instead of looking burgers, scritating ating eggs or rubber bears behind behind, the vegan quickly quickly discovered completely new products, and enthusiasm enthusiasm to enthusiasm.
" It is a double bonus, " Proctor says, " in fact, vegan is not a abandonment, no asscticism, but it is an enrichment " " assumption assumption that change reduces reduces the choice of options puts Proctor rather to the power of habit.
And it was these conditions that left many of however well-intentioned attempts.
" The addiction is a crucial factor that lets many give up quickly, similar to smoking, " Proctor compares.
And repents:' certain tastes must not be attached to the animal'.
Often it spices or the way of preparation that make the taste.
" You can also create the same effect in a different ", " the vegan demonstrates.
To a barQ festival, Proctor will with eggines, mushrooms rooms and also a few van sausages.
He takes care to a balanced, varied diet, where which it should taste good good once.
Of course, we want something teeth between something, that is legitimate.
" It should taste, but this must not only reduced to animal food, " said Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, a further popular assumption, he had not suffered.
For me, the conversion over had a positive aspect.
I do not take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high performance athlletes who eat only vegan.
" My blood values are excellent, I'll myself be check many times ", Proctor Proctor.
In particular, the lack of vitamin B12 is warto many veganism critics.
'Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on the pasture, it is doubable ful whether in the meat meat bought in the cold chant, the vitamin -B12 is high', Proctor finds.
Vegans also also have the opportunity to take coenzyme in the form of tablets.
" My B12 values are in order, " he explains.
Proctor did not have to go any long ways for obtaining food.
After all, basic foods are are everywhere everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
Everything I need, I find on the spot.
Only from and time special I buy something special.
" Many people overlook fact that only the finished products are expensive, but it is known known be the case with with " " finished finished products ".
In any case, the preparation egegan an was much much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed.
" In the house kitchen there is a lot to discover, with a few small cracks, you can achieve good, if not partly better results, " says Proctor.
Margarine instead butter, slightly more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with his vegan cheese-ake ake Proctor tor also marvel ze his parthers--in-law.
Family celebrations lends the vegan a spment.
That has a,, when cocotogether it has a new value.
" The situations that this can arise are as different as people themselves, " says Proctor.
Of course, course,, has been been sceptical.
Does my food no longer like any you?
" Should I supposed to feel bad because I drink milk? " - on such questions you you must be a vegan with a sensitivity.
" I do not reject the people, I am part of this society, " Proctor does not want to have enclavenasein period.
And, more more detail, the everyday world does not appear as vegalien as imagected - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as is commonly assumed.
Fast food, fast food is permitted.
There are chips all in the world!
" Many öncher shops offer falafel, or even a vegetarian Yufka, " says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he flads to pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza free without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly slowly to it.
'When I started feeding eat vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult', the New elandanders can find a development:' You have to talk to the people, make them aware of it'.
" When sufficient demand come, they may be inclined to supplement the menu, " he hopes.
Vegan restaurants evolve, such as the Compressses in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfree.
Proctor also that other restaurants to have at at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
" Meat dishes, however, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word because they exclude exclude others " " Proctor notes.
" If you want to avoid food scandals veganism is a safe way to make most impossible in the impossible, " says Proctor.
However, purchasing vegan an products could be somewhat difficult at the beginning.
Especially if you learn ns to understand that can also contained in peanuts animal additives as a source of colour, it seems seems to adhere to ethics ethics so many many les and traps seem courage to leave quickly.
That is not why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: " Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their Alternatives " explains the many ingredients that which food and and ergergare enclosed ended.
" Graby ally you develop a look of scanner and know what characters and logos you must pay attention to " It is sometimes better to take small steps than stopping or stumbling, " white Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingerering beon consciousness.
He may not quite manage to abandon his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question their habits.

Scientists could shed more light on the link of coswwing of a dog with its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wwwith the tail more to the right (from point of view of the dog, while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists are saying that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurost at the University of Tto, said, “ It is well well known that the left and right-right brain hemisemisthe brain react differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions. ”
Here we have tried to look at this for other species.
He also noted that in dogs, like humans, the right brain hemisemisere were responsible for the movement of left left and vice versa, and that the two hemisemises played played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral swof of their fellow ates, researchers watched animals as these films were other dogs looked themselves.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legs and analyzed the behavior.
We are soon soon to understand why the tail is moving in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, ‘ We showed the dog movies with dogs – either a faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and thus enabled us to direct the movement of the tail to the left or right. ”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moving the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wging dog, they remained completely relaxed.
But if the inclinsity of mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wedgs), their their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Instead, he believes that the dogs would have learned from experience which movements they should worry about and when should not.
He said: ‘ If you have different meetings with other dogs, and the Wedis ding with the tail in one direction is linked with friendly behaviour, and the right side produces rather less friendly behaviour, then respond on the basis of these experiences. ’
Researsay that the knowledge of dog owners, veterinarians, and trainaches could provide a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Medicology at the University of Bristol stated that this was not the first study to which to whether whether left and right were important to dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln discovered that dogs turn their head left when they watch an aggressive dog, and turn right if it is a satisfied dog.
In another research at the University of of Canada, it was this: “ dogs are likely to go a robotic dog if their is, wg on the left, not not worry rather than the right – exactly the other way round than in the Italian study. ”
According to him, the differences could be be that the dogs in various dogs did did not interpret animals in the films or robotic dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals als that the brain hhalemisemiss are used for different purposes, many of the the details still yet to be determined – and dogs are no exception, ” said Bradshaw.
However, since their behavior can easily recorded, it will probably not take long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.

CCry Crispair of an Obama Vooter
I voted twice for President Obama in the hope that change was possible.
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts, frustrated by the Republican blocking blocking ettactics.
Bloade ade doesn ’ excuse use the website problems of Obamacare, the Drone Attacks
Obama ’ s memoirs of the 2008 campaign are a sad reminreminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading a terrible readbook sad moment.
It is a book that I believed it would cheusten me during the sinzy second year of medical medicine and give give me hope.
It is called “ The Audacity to Win, ” and describes Barack Obama ’ s memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish with my patient papers in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could rotake their breath from speaking.
The election was a landslide victory and news keskers stopped to demonstrate the historic significance of this hour.
My classmates criept for joy, and my parents collected all of the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was headed to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008 2008 he had an 82% approval rating.
And then I will close the book.
Swining back to the present is a bad awawakening as like being n out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has indeed changed.
But it is not nothing I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that that partsan political ade tactactics overversed many many efforts to our our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of GuantanBay, to name but a few.
But, having defended the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I have finished trying to explain.
I have come to a point of political despair.
Republican blockade politics cannot explain why it allows allowed to interept ept foreign leaders, or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot not explain the National National Security Agency ects data on Americans ’ s private lives, and why whistlebblowers wers who pose pose government behavior are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a American citizen, was been murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and spending limits are bvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report that which states that the efforts of the White House to calm quiet the media are ‘ ‘ most aggressive... since the Nixon government ’.
And most recently it can ’ t excuse the inability acity to design a simple website in more than than three years since the the AfforforCare Care Care Act.
I do not know if that is what I should expect.
Whether I should have understood by 18 that the work could run contrary to the preceding political it.
Apparently, the office is not a predictable course, because an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre charactershape public debate.
But when I look at the examples examples, they seem seem to been largely elected by the government itself.
And that bobome me most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was delighted about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbakched alternative, he did not seem able to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free of pressure from future elections, would fulfill hope we had been about about so so long.
But, with Obama ’ s approval ratings falling to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 became all the harder by this book.
It awakens the longing for the many promises that have vaninto in air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama Obama suffered a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election workers after the decision, he told his staff that they must return on course and follow the purpose of their cause.
“ I want us to find our magic again, ” he said.
We will have to remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr President, and I could not agree more more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest on parental leave.
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in his plans to for parental leave, because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.

The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, important in deciding whether the carbon and mining taxes will be scraor or cut.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest, and that the daughters of Abbott personally would benefit from the laws.

Palmer called for a review of the process of counting process so that it can proceed faster.
Tony Abbott daughghters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“ We need a better system, ” he said.
Why should we not have a system where you invin, enter data into a computer, pick it immediately and get the result at 6: 30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticised the use of penpencils in marking the ballot papers.
Are they be used because we can then wipe out the results if you do not like them?
To oting with pencils these days is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, declared that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new new office very seriously.
A public office is about about service to the public.
“ We do not seek for reward reward but of history, namely that we can serve this community at a time critical time, ” he said.

For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his sick father losing consciousness over and again again and went to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First he had only a broken arm arm but then then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain, causing a hememoma that to affect him for the rest of his life.
" There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, ” says Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken it from Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to to get the treatment they had to offer.
“ It ’ not easy, ” commented Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and yet you are not first.
There are a great many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has changed changed since Bwell ’ s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for 5,000 5,000, according to the World Health Organization.
By contrast, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most cameroons could not afford the visit.
Two out of five domestic people are living below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country ’ s health spending is private.
“ The only problem they have is poverty, ” says Bsaid.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his fellow atrisuffered suffered made matmatmature in the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations over the past year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular geon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on rural areas in rural and and free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his voluntary group have helped just under 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, forced forced himself and to 30 30 people into minibuses and travel with the packed medical equipment on the roof over untaved terrain to the villages that need help.

But when they arrive, they are receive like heroes: a banast dinner, singing and dance, and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebrate and wave – with his broad smile and boundless energy – is happy in the cheerful celebration.
The next morning, the team then the investigating hundreds of patients.
“ We will treat 500 people per trip, according to Bwave.
You will come from a 60 km radius around the village – on foot.
Each of these weekend hospitals offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnonutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free certificates of birth – a document is required for the school, but simply simply cannot afford many poor families.
In the evening, the team performout simple operations with local anaesthetic.
The operations usually take place in a school, town hall, or apartment; after the the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the surgical and disinfection equipment is provided by the generator of the group and so way wave and its volunteers work up into the early hours on Sunday.
It is a exhauring exercise, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“ They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work, ” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team goes return to the city, tired, but proud of the work done.
The group – a mix of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has out 700 free surgery over the past year and knows that its work work has makes a huge difference for the people it helps.
One man explained that the free corrubreaking operation that he received has now allowed him to work again.
“ This is changing the future of my family, ” the man said.
In addition to the weekend hospitals and his work as surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he financed 60% of his non-profit activity, to Bwelle; the remainder come from private donations.
“ I really don not know when he is sleeping, ” Katie atie O'Malley, spent in second second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia a and voluntvoluntearily in Bwell ’ s group.
He is always either in hospital or tempted to raise money for the organization to to go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the US and and support wave, is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
“ We can be present in operations where we help help fup blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle, ” explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America second year student in America as a medical student.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and and often often donated sanitation equipment.
But once you are re in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and the instructions.
" He is without doubt a hero, " says O'Malley.
He dedicvotes his life to this organisation, and his desire to help the Cameroon people, knows no boundaries.
For wave wave, the almost constant work is no burden.
Giving others with a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he gave to his father gave him great joy.
“ I am so happy to do this work, ” says Bwelle.
And I am thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I am doing.
I do it to make people laugh and to alleviate the pain.

Mthe the Excellently
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's velnovel " The old man and the sea " is cut Horst Janson on his body.
Janson is an old hin his profession of of acting.
No one can fude the old man when Santiago in fishing.
So the two simply complement each other.
It is almost thought to see the folds at the neck of the old man mentioned by the fishershwyoung Manolo.
When Santiago is sitting tired of life bbbdown on the chair, that is real with Janson.
Besides addition the role of the old fisheris through and a characteristic that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish thanks to his knowledge and also willwill.
Janson is on stage as solo performin in many distances.
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue bottles bottles of water.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in boat in front of the fishing village.
During the course of the performance he puts the active scene into light: the Hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gst, which voices s Cuban sense of life with her songs and splendid voice.
The four musicians play Cuba ’ s rhythm and at the same time they are guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At about 120 metres length below from Cologne there a a sesesewater from the Roman period.
Those who visit Cologne, ’ 't miss the Cathedral.
Around 157 metres, the two towers soar into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only few visitors who admire the two filigree steees realize that there is a lot of discover to even ath the Cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the Cologne Unterworld.
Meeting point for its guided tours is the Service-Center of Cologne n-Tourism directly at the Dom.
The tour begins quite unularly: " We start in the underground car garage, " says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the town Fathers wanted an auto-fitting city, and therefore, of the remains of the old city walls only only stopped which was not not large too large.
Most users of the multi-storey car park therefore also ry ush past the Roman remains and and only off their car.
But if you takes a closer look, you covers an archaeological site site separated is separated separated by metal metal bars in the Park deck D2.
You can see five methigh high ruins of handser-sized stones.
" There are the remains of the Roman city walls, built in the second half of the first century BC, " says Schulze.
Before it comes back to the light again SchulSchulze allows participants on the upper floor floor still take a look at a dark shaft 15 meters deep.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately is also hardly noticed.
The next station of the tour is the Pretorium, and here participants descdown to the depths.
Here we experience the official seat of the once the most powerful man north of the Alps, the preursof of CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor would like to know.
" The abronym stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ", which means in in as much as " city of Roman law and city of Agrippinans, founded by Emperor Claudius, the place of the altar for the emperor peror cult " means ".
And the Pretorium is the former statbal palace, the center of power of the Roman empire on the Rhine.
From the front way of the exhibition is a tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel, here over a length of around 120 metres.
" You can easily walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want, " Schulze encourages ts the guests.
Debdle still has a surprise.
After getting ching the key at the checkoffice, he leads the group to a walable shaft 16 meters deep.
" We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bathbath, " he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater that was essential for the ritual washing.
To today, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins go back the eighth century, different water levels can be seen due to the varying levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square for which construction is to begin shortly.
However, there will still a few more years to completion.

The Diswerback Society doesn ’ Think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood good, but some point it goes home.
However: in the bellies of the people on the front passenger and rear seat, hunger becomes felt.
Of course, some cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What is be obvious than chelling to the next drive-In to treat yourself with a little bit?
I admit that I am happy to be part when it comes to fast-food ching later later or early in the morning.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then nix like from home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco performers become apparent.
For what should you miss the, that you throw throw your fast food out of car window with constant regularity?!
Especially at weekends weekends discarded paper bags are located on street borders and parking spaces.
" wonder wonder.
Are the people too doof to take the bags with home to the next dustbin?
It is not only that paper paper paper that disup the landscape.
Bags have already covered aled transport facilities such as as age barriers, and thus caused accidents.
What does not about the' disposable society' does not think, probably she she does even even know what this word means.
If you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know how a backbench after a celebrated nights can look like: clothing, bottles and other rubbage are aming there.
A few of velopes would not be more or less less - contrary to the road, where no one wants to trample on the food's of others.
I can already see the day when when the towns and communities will going to too stupdy - and the fast food chains have to demand demand deposit for their bags.
