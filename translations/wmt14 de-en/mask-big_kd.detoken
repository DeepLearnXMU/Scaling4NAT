Greater Safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 metres apart: on Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian light at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older town hall lights.
Two facilities so close to each other: intention or a coup d'etat?
Gutach's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
" The town hall light was installed back then because it ensures the school path, " Eckert explained yesterday.
The traffic light is safe for cyclists and bus passengers and mountain residents.
The plant, which was officially put into operation yesterday, is important for the crossing section Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, a spa park, a bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ‘ mine ’.
" With the high volume of traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to be built for their safety, " says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Councillor of Offenburg.
" According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the Municipality of Gutach on the B 33 every day, of which about ten per cent is heavy goods traffic, " stresses Arnold.
This is why the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: " Safety is easy here, " says Arnold.
A total of four traffic views were carried out, a roundabout was also planned, but was discarded because of the narrowness in the intersection of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, everything was tested tested during the location of the traffic light poles: " By means of a transporter specially loaded with particularly long trunks for us, we tested whether these vehicles could be extended from the Sulzbachweg path to the B 33 without bending over the traffic lights ".
The traffic light system, which costs around around 15 000 euros, is " the most modern on the market today, " Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so vigorously that the lights are easily visible by the drivers, for example, even in the low sun.
It is also economical: the older lights consume about 100 watts, the new ones use just eight watts.
There are three lights per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: Arnold is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic light, the upper radar sensor will test the traffic situation.
If the road is cleared, there will be immediate green for the pedestrian; if not, it will take about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can end.
" Should a group or disabled people cross the streets, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will pass safely on the road, " explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver must play a part in this and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: as soon as the traffic lights for pedestrians were green, an upper class vehicle rushed through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and adolescence from the soul for more than 30 years.
The Carinthian poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the tendency towards brute violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and the lack of joy.
The winner of the Büchner Prize is well known as a prose author, and theatrical texts are scarce in his work.
Collage of prose texts Gerhard Fresacher therefore composes a collage of prose texts for his performance " Weather lights on the tip of the tongue ", which can now be seen in Garage X on St. Peter's Square.
The theatre maker combines, for example, elements from the autobiographical novel Der Leibeigene (1987) with prosaminiatures from " Leichnam, seine Familie " (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important props: a jlogged sofa on which there is hint of copying and masturbating - the eight-person ensemble hingles through the textual material.
Director Fresacher seems to trust the text.
The 70-minute performance covers the original with a wealth of directing cases, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
The actresses in particular are involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are hit hard, dipped with their heads under water, painted to the wall with their evening robes.
Forced into cellophane or bosss, they strock through the staging on dangerously high stiinks, either monologze vociferously or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys in this strict way.
The best moments are in the evening when singing - from deep purple to popular songs.
It is only towards the end that the twisted performance comes to rest, and Winkler ’ s almost absurd humor sparkles.
A car black box?
US street planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, believing they have found the solution in a small black box that can fit on every car ’ s dashboard.
The devices that record every kilometre and report information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt on the part of Washington and state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The usually boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked intense debate with colourful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and argue that the government should be able to use the small boxes to record the kilometres travelled – and possibly where they have been driven – and then use the information to calculate tax moes.
Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But, while Congress cannot agree on action, several states are not waiting any longer.
They are currently examining how, over the next decade, they can switch to a system whereby drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This really is a must for our country.
“ It ’ s not something we ’ ll possibly use, ” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the mileage of all Californian drivers from 2025 onwards.
How we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed by the taxes paid by the Americans at the fuel pump, is bankrupt.
But America no not has as much fuel as it used to do.
Cars consume less petrol.
The government tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by one cent at high prices.
“ The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable, ” says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile based payment system.
“ This is the best alternative in the long run, ” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mileage based user charge.
Not surprisingly, the idea appeals to urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way that reduces congestion and climate-damaging emissions.
California ’ s planners rely on the system to devise strategies to achieve the state ’ s ambitious, legally binding climate change goals.
But the Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he sees this as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Reason Foundation ’ s free marketers also embrace the idea of making drivers pay by distance travelled.
“ This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole, ” explains Adrian Moore, Vice President of Guidelines at Reason.
People are paying directly for what they are getting.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, called on Congress to move toward mileage accounting.
The US Senate approved a $90 million pilot last year, covering 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to the concerns of rural MEPs who represent people who often have to travel many miles to work or to the city in their daily lives.
Nevertheless, several states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
Most committed is Oregon, who currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay mileage fees to the state instead of the petroleum tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently examining how the change could be introduced.
The concept is not universal.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with equipment, drivers were skeptical about thinking that the government could follow any of their movements.
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem, ” explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategic and Outcome Management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People did not want.
When the test started, Nevada ACLU warned on its Web site: “ It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into fully-fledged surveillance devices. ”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that will allow the state to capture the kilometers travelled, but not exactly when and where.
According to Khan, this would also reassure public opinion.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not originally step in to help states tax drivers.
Rather, its aim was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for motor insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles they have travelled.
But the equipment she tests is also of interest to road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded, ” said Ryan Morrison, Chief Executive Officer of True Mileage.
Major mistakes were made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways in which this is implemented.
In Oregon, planners experiment with giving drivers a variety of choices.
You can choose with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any equipment at all and instead pay a flat rate based on the average mileage travelled by all state residents.
Other bodies hope to sell the concept of a distrustful public sphere by providing the devices with more functions than fewer ones.
In New York City, transport officials want to develop a tax device that can also pay parking fees, pay insurance only for mileage travelled, and collect speed data in real time from other vehicles that will enable drivers to avoid congestion.
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system, ” says one of the city ’ s planning documents.
But some traffic planners wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials declared that Congress could solve the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they, too, pay a fair share.
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is ices, ” explains Randy Rentschler, head of the Commission ’ s legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small Team ’ s Battle
The Voluntary Fire Brigade handled its herb ’ s main test with flying colours, despite a lack of staff.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Command of the department Hans Kammerer chose the property Feder in Burgberger Straße in his practice.
This is where a short circuit is said to have been created during sawing.
Two people were injured by the fire and smoke development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After Hans Kammerer ’ s first review of the situation, two breathing carriers of the Wwehr agreed to enter the building.
After a short period of time, the first person was found and led to the open air.
The second person had to be worn in.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow staircase to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
In addition, there were electrical machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack took place by means of the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via an overflow hydrant about 100 metres away.
Now it has been possible to design three deletion attacks.
A hollow tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer ’ s exercise was also about pointing out what can be done with few staff available.
In case of an emergency, support is provided via the Königsfeld Day Operation Group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of carrying out the exercise.
Networking of Universities and Companies Important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau High Black Forest, the President of the German Parliament, Guido Wolf, also found information in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers of tomorrow came from.
At the High Black Forest Support Centre, he examined this important issue together with the Managing Directors of the Vocational Schools as well as the Kreisgymnasium and the chairmen of the Parental Advisory Board.
" Education is an important location factor, " underlined Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Black Forest Education Centre.
Wolf was impressed by the training model projects.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and Vocational School Centre in Wälderstadt.
He also praised the friendliness of the county.
" It is important to keep an eye not only on the family phase, but also, due to demographic change, on the phase of caring for the care of relatives, " Wolf explained.
He also said that an increasing number of employees were concerned for caring for and caring for their loved ones.
" Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship, " Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities.
" Those who have already got to know the benefits of the region during their studies often remain with the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills, which helps to strengthen the region, " said the President of the provincial parliament.
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the demand for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the district's location advantage is its favourable location in the south-west of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
On his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to develop local public transport.
'Persevere and ensure that public transport improves,' he said to the local councillors present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music.
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to a coffee, cake and then to a vesper.
In the past, the elderly were cared for in the resting place.
In the meantime this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was a sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with popular melodies.
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall, which is the front delimitation of the old school to Kirchstraße, is to be put once again on the rehabilitation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days leading up to the kilgram, a small angular wall to help stabilise and static relieve of the more than one hundred year-old natural stone wall with balustrade was installed in the first work on the rehabilitation of the front school yard.
Alexander further procedure, such as Alexander Misok of the Bräunlingen City Building Office, envisages involving the National Monument Office in the planning and the creation of a rehabilitation concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation will then be carried out by experts, which will then be put on the table of the local council to decide and determine how to proceed.
A decision on this is expected to be taken next year.
After the rehabilitation, pavement and tree planting of the old inner school yard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the boundary wall in need of renovation will have to be completely renovated and placed on a new structure in the foreseeable future.
The historic hundred-year-old delimitation wall of the old school yard to the Kirchstraße is in need of renovation mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage and has an arch inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not at risk of collapse at the moment.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for the use of a school yard by pupils, which has been carried out by means of the current fortification work.
Originally, the school refurbishment was planned even in 2008-2009, but high unscheduled spending led in a postponement.
An important word in the historical renovation of the school wall, which has even been used for filming, will be used by the National Monument Office.
If any instructions comes from this side, the city of Bräunlingen hopes to receive subsidies from the memorians.
Stupupils of the Bräunlingen Primary School, who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new auditorium, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now also intervened in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart, " Özdemir said the " Stuttgart News ".
Jazz and classical music go hand in hand right now at the Stuttgart jazz location.
In doing so, Özdemir, who is regarded as the favourite for a direct mandate in Stuttgart in the federal elections on 22 September, contradicts the Green Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, it promotes a reorganization of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
The programme jazz and pop will then be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
US border: " Super-tunnel " for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the US, investigators have discovered and closed a' super tunnel' for drug smuggling.
According to US customs officials, the more than 500 metre long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks, and an ventilation system.
Three suspects have therefore been arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine have been seized.
According to information, the tunnel had not yet been used.
" These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig under the radar, " said Laura Duffy, Attorney General of Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end to the tunnel had been discovered.
Duffy assured the drug gangs:' If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money'.
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in constant struggle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77 000 people have been killed in drug-related crime in Mexico.
Constructed by Experts
Due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped so that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 metres in depth to the actual entrance to the tunnel.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres in height and 90 centimetres in width.
In so doing, it would have been suited to encouraging illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine covenant.
The third, a Mexican, was seized for the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened with life imprisonment as a maximum sentence, as officials have said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, according to the press conference in San Diego.
However, this is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Usually, cocaine is smuggled in small quantities, not through tunnels.
This is demonstrated by the " despair " of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman from the DEA drug search in San Diego.
They would do everything in their power to get to the United States.
No details have been given of the detainees, at least one of whom is Mexican, they said.
They face up to ten years in prison.
2014 will be Geisinger Fixed Year
The jubilee of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of 1250.
Return of the first mention of documents is approaching.
When the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks' time, the anniversary year is approaching.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794.
A document has been produced in churches in which both places are mentioned.
An official start to the jubilee year is to take place on 15 March, and since Geisingen does not have a hall, this kick-off event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
On the occasion of the anniversary, a number of events are planned in both Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen.
Kirchen-Hausen will be in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July the 1250.
Celebrate a return.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this weekend there is also the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest.
On the occasion of its anniversary, City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a contract composition for the city, which will be performed on three dates.
On the 21st of June together with the solwing celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12th July in the Arena with fireworks and on the 13th of December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
It will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is the last weekend of September, September 27th and 28th.
A new chronicle will be published on the occasion of the Geisinger anniversary of the city.
" But it should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but also a printed work about today's spiritual singing, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen, " says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
Today ’ s violin is also celebrating its birthday in 2014, and 1974 1974 today ’ s spatial space with the communal communities was completed.
The new chronicle will be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Narrative Guild Strohglonki begins on 8 February with an evening of customs on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the festival banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the District Music Festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Leipferdingen Altenwerk is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at its new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and is celebrating this as part of the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in documents in 764 in a gift certificate owned by the St. Gallen Monastery.
The certificate was produced in churches (Hausen), which was then a court place.
Both are mentioned in the same document.
The reason for celebrating this 1250-year-old in 2014 is also 40 years since the municipal reform.
Council targets railways
Should the railway crossing " Am Hirschen " be extensively in order to increase road safety?
Yes, local councils have decided.
Schiltach must take EUR 220 000 into his own hands for this purpose.
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal next year.
In particular, safety at railway crossings is to be increased - trains and other vehicles collide regularly nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the renovation measures, they have to share a third of the costs, while the rest are shared by the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's master town builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the Municipal Council the special features of the Bahcrossing " Am Hirschen ".
There, the city plans to build a bay at the height of the tunnel there west of the railway tracks.
Larger vehicles, such as those transporting lumber, could also be on track with each other without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed that a necessary support wall should be constructed in such a way that the city could widen the adjacent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was a controversial issue in the local council because some councils questioned the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp's statement summed up the mood of the critics:' Should we take so much money because of so few vehicles?'
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing " Hirschen " is regularly used for longitudinwood transport.
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route would serve as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed.
Since it is foreseeable that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be converted and repaired, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing " Am " Hirschen " could also be accorded important traffic importance for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to have an investigation into the cost of widening the roads.
Despite this, the majority agreed to the reconstruction of the railway crossing with the proviso that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city could, if necessary, extend the adjacent road in the direction of " Bahnhofstraße " to about 5.5 metres for meeting traffic.
The restructuring of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery, on the other hand, could create a completely different problem concerning access to the soaring' Geroltzhäuser Weg'.
The administration had had the railway conversion plans examined by the Breinlinger engineering office, as it doubted whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would then be easily possible.
The study concluded that it cannot be ruled out that the inclination of the road could lead to longer vehicles being seated.
The responsibility for this, in turn, lies with the city as a road builder.
The restructuring could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Haas argued that both the wood drainage and the turning worked in the current state of expansion, so one should not agree to the reconstruction of the railway transition.
In addition, the risk of the train being collided with a vehicle in transition is significantly lower here than at the other railway crossings, because right next to it is the centre of the stop to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main train station should be slowed down at this point that there is no collision.
A majority of them were refused consent to the reconstruction of this railway crossing, as the city of Schiltach would have to' pay for " the problem of seated vehicles, according to the Councils, because the railways could withdraw from responsibility once the construction had been completed.
The panel has no problem with the reconstructions at the' Vor Heubach and' Vor Kuhbach' railway crossings, for which crossings with the railways have already been made.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Far planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they intend to launch in the coming years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five of which are still in the race.
Far away worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets in other stars.
No one knows whether there are lives on at least some of them.
The choice is difficult: search for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for earth-like planets and thus perhaps discover alien life?
These questions are being asked by those responsible for the European Space Agency Esa.
For their Cosmic Vision programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that should make decisive progress in research.
The budget for such L missions is around EUR 1 billion.
The launch is expected to take place in 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were discussed, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Many bodies are looking at the proposals and researchers are lagging behind.
A final decision is to be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee in the next few days.
The Esa has selected a total of four major questions, to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme, initiated in 2007, will find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planet and life?
The exact process of creating stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets that orbit these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could permeate through this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can life be created there?
To investigate this question, the " Cheops " space telescope is to be launched in 2017, which will examine in closely 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity.
But the possibilities are limited, cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map earth-like planets, and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, thus searching for " biomarkers ": gases that are seen as an indication of biological activity.
How does solar work?
This question, too, should ultimately shed light on the conditions that exist for the creation of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as its particle radiation with the planetary system play an important role.
These processes can be examined as examples in our solar system.
With the Solar Orbiter, the Esa has already approved an M class mission (the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe starts in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa is the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision program.
The probe " Juice " (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start its journey in 2022.
She reached Jupiter eight years later and was to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
Space space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to examine whether the laws of nature with which we are familiar are still valid there.
There may also be deviations that could show physicists the way to a new theory under whose umbrella all known laws of nature can be combined.
How did the universe come into being, and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos were created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the familiar matter that make up stars, planets, and creatures like us, there are dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and dark energy that accelerates the expansion of space.
So far, researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the big Bang ’ s second, nor do they know what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With " Euclid ", the Esa has already approved an M mission to be launched in 2020.
By means of a special telescope, the probe is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn as to the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who Could Make the Race
Of the 30, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, the best chances for an L-mission are " E-Lisa ", an ambitious concept for detecting gravitational waves.
By this physicists mean changes in the structure of spacetime that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven.
Elisa could succeed, scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provided for a detector consisting of two or three probes, which was stationed in space.
Unlike plants on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves created by the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the emergence of the cosmos.
Four other proposals compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " to explore black holes, " Icy Planets ", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, " Prism ", a cosmic background radiation measurement mission, and the " Exoplanet Finder " to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
Proposals for the retransport of samples from Mars, moon, Venus and asteroid exploration, and solar physics have already left.
Snowden is willing to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US Surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistblolower of the US intelligence, has said that he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify to the German Bundestag unless the National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received asylum to discuss what he said with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden by Ströbele to the media in Berlin on Friday, he writes, “ While the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissent as a loyalty and tries to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment that is not defence. ”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In den letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the international community support can persuade the American government to drop the charge against him.
The indictment made by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Minister of the Interior, Hans-Peter Friedrich, said to Zeit Online: ‘ If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German representatives, we will find ways of making this possible ’.
US-Germany relations are strained by claims that the NSA has eavesdropped German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of parliament who chairs the secret parliamentary committee, has said that one seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible, “ without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US. ”
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists when he visited Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to former NSA employee Snowden ’ s lawyer, he cannot return to Russia when he leaves the country.
When Snowden testifies in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is “ safe, ” he says.
Snowden states in his letter that he faces a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that had driven him out of his homeland.
But it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression. ”
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a public service.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved. ”
Frontier Airlines charges hand
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 from passengers who wish to store hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand baggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday stated that passengers were allowed to keep the can.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat, and small bags beneath the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said that you will calculate $25 if the fee is paid in advance and $100 for travellers who paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee aims to get travelers to pay beforehand.
“ We don ’ t want to calculate this sum, ” she explained.
In 2008, airlines began to charge for the first and second checked items of baggage.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore dumped as much their hand baggage as possible, with the result that the compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are one way of persuading passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money.
It is about Frontier ’ s most loyal customers, who would have clearly stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take one piece of baggage at the Frontier boarding gate free of charge, but the next person may have to pay USD 100 for a comparable piece of baggage.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and check-in procedures will be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they get to the gate.
Frontier's new hand baggage fee will only enter into force in the summer, and no exact date has yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that baggage transport costs money and passengers should pay for it if they so wish.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are collecting enough money to cover air travel after years of loss.
Most of them, however, have left their fingers on hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded first hand baggage charges three years ago, followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
According to airline consultancy Jay Sorensen, the only other airline with such a charge is Hungarian Wizz Air, which closely monitors additional charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit ’ s hand baggage fee would raise $50 million a year.
Sorensen, formerly leader at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual hand baggage fee.
“ The boarding process was one of the smosmoothest I have seen in my career in aviation, ” he said.
I expected to see toothcracking and palpable discussions at the boarding gate.
“ The plane was full, ” he declared, “ and lubricated. ”
Frontier follows Spirit in the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice are allowed to keep the whole can and that coffee will be replenished free of charge.
Water remains.
US Airways had briefly tried to charge money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed it seven months later, after passengers complained and no other large company had followed suit.
Frontier's move to charging hand baggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to its own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz for between $10 and $25 per ticket sold.
This provides all airlines with an incentive to buy directly from them rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, miles were again reduced to 25% of the route.
A flight with Frontier of more than 1000 miles booked with a third party provider therefore brings in customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when they make a direct purchase on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele at its Denver headquarters, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenues decreased by 9 percent and flight capacity shrank just under 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report published on Wednesday by its parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to control Frontier ’ s finances as it sells society.
Proverbials Coming from the Bible
More than 40 women visited the last women ’ s breakfast of this year in the Protestant church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the Municipal House were " proverbials from the Bible " and " phrases from the Middle Ages ".
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, Chairman of the Church Municipal Council, addressed the biblical proverbials in a lecture.
" Proverbs contain life wisdom, regulations or warnings, " she explained.
It compared several proverbs to the Bible and explained their meaning.
She called proverbials such as: wooden eyes are vigilant, as scales fall off the eyes, keep an eye on someone, the Lord gives in sleep, wash his hands of it.
On several occasions, the speaker also let her listeners advise what the proverb was.
The church leader Christel Dehner took up the medieval phrase: all good things are three, make blue, something hidden.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called' bridges to the past'.
Finally a raffle was raffled.
The prizes were covered on a table and described humorously before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round was also the mayor ’ s candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry at the Mecklenburg Seenplatte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 men and women who already work as unskilled people in the industry are to be qualified as specialists for hotels and restaurants over the course of three winters.
" What is new is that the six-month courses end with degrees, " said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Employment agency.
The benefits are manifold: it would not make participants unemployed, it would give companies trained professionals who were increasingly absent in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are also involved in the project.
NSA says that it is an “ internal error, ” not hackers, who is to blame for the website crash.
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that an bug paralyzed its public website for several hours, not hackers, as was claimed online.
“ NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update, ” explained the espionage agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be fixed tonight.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and is still not available to some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was not compromised “ in any way. ”
According to the speaker, secret information is not in jeopardy.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed paralyzing the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website will be inundated with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and attacks do not serve to penetrate the target system's internal network.
Formerly the super-secret NSA, once nicknamed as No Such Agency (no such agency), is now in the public eye, facing strong criticism following revelations that have come to light in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing intelligence controversy fueled initial speculation that today ’ s incident was the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of people without a job fell sharply in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the 3.1% quota is better than last year and also better than in September, " we would have hoped for more, " says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Agency for Employment in Sonthofen.
After all, many companies have so far reacted when recruring people.
One reason for this, according to Felder-Bauer, is: " We have few specialists in crafts, health care and care for the elderly ".
Due to the course of the year, job openings for staff in the hotel and catering industry have been coming up again since September.
In the middle of December the winter season starts there.
The entire background report can be found in the Allgäu ad sheet from 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Loss of profits at Bombardier due to a decrease in delivery numbers and orders
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% drop in net profit after coming under pressure from declining orders and deliveries for third-quarter aircraft, as well as contract problems in the railway sector.
Nor did Montreal based Bombardier publish any flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could operate commercially next September, in accordance with the ambitious timetable.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago has been followed by only three more take-offs, making it doubtful whether the test phase is proceeding as planned.
Results fell short of forecasts and causing a more than 8% drop in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation from outperform to “ sector perform ” on Thursday, with limited price potential in the next one or two quarters.
“ Although weaker delivery figures for aircraft were expected to a large extent, we are clearly disappointed by margin developments in the transport sector, ” said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aeroplane's test programme progresses.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and first flew in September after months of delays.
So far, however, binding orders for CSeries at 177 have been moderate, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet aircraft are correct.
Currently, there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 binding orders at the start of the commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the management also assured analysts and the media that the programme was on schedule.
“ The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any longer than expected, ” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were in place during the aircraft ’ s service life.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then append a period of review, which we have done.
This happens throughout the flight programme.
The second out of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, the rest shortly thereafter, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts remain sceptical as to whether, 12 months after the maiden flight, the first customer can put a CSeries aircraft into operation.
Bombardier declared that it is reviewing commissioning planning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“ The slow progress of the flight test – though obviously in line with Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015, ” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share of $172 million or 9 cents per share the previous year.
Adjusted earnings per share remain unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world states that it has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 aircraft.
The aerospace order book was US $32.9 billion on 30 September, unchanged compared to 31 December.
“ In the aerospace sector, the results were our targets, but low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing, ” said Beaudoin.
Aerospace revenues fell 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have increased by just under 11% to $2.1 billion.
On September 30, the order book in the Transport Division amounted to USD 32.6 billion, slightly up to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems with some major contracts.
According to the company's management, there will be new guidelines for the fourth quarter.
In after-ons trading on Thursday, Bombardier shares declined by 8.5%, to $4.83, after it was also announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette would join the Board of Management.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier ’ s narrowest rival, reported a 10% decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
Shooting at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots at the LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management told us via Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security man, too, had been killed.
Media also reported several injured.
US President Barack Obama is constantly informed of the situation, said the White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eye witnesses indicated that they saw a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
One traveller told CNN that many people had panicked.
Travelers would have shouted and cried children.
Panic has erupted among those who are waiting, with many hiding behind chairs out of fear.
He has heard two shots, says a Los Angeles Times.
A TSA employee had suffered a firing injury.
The scene was " like a movie ".
After that he was brought into a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots are said to have been fired close to a security control area.
Airport Buildings
Television pictures showed how many health and police cars ran in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people have been taken out of the building.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special deployment command and a rifle lying on the ground.
According to the airport management via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were closed, which, according to CNN, resulted in long backjams.
With the exception of landings, it was said that air traffic had been temporarily discontinued.
However, there were several planes on CNN at take-off.
Terminal 3 is served by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine addicts, who warned drug boss against police investigation, must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to underworld size Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer was afraid that his covert drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced by Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation for fearing that his secret drug addiction might be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into his activities in drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The “ Bash ” lawyer, hailed by criminals as “ first-class, ” was arrested in his house in 2011, after the police oversaw Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug case.
Officials saw Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues in the Bar Association.
Investigations revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallets, and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after the police secured £1.5 million heroin and cocaine and £200,000 in cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on on to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction might be published.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and sentenced at Crown Court in Liverpool after three weeks on two charges for obstructing justice.
In a previous survey, he admitted cocaine ownership.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found in their investigation into Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house where he put the drugs under the lawyer's dustbin with 60% purity in a black golf glove.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was in the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park for dinner.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between them.
It became known in court that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests had discovered Class A drugs in his hair, wallets, and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had talked to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that her discussion was subject to “ lawyers ’ secrecy. ”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample taken from him.
In police interrogation, he stated that he was running an office at both his private address and at work, and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It became known in court that he had called key drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, for significant arrests and informed of what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you are not breaking the law. ”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a defender because he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker, but that of a drug trafficker who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the advocate of these people.
But this went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He counteracted police investigations as far as possible so that they could carry out their criminal activities.
Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed any misconduct, claiming, “ If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but would immediately. ”
But after the hearing, superintendent Lee Halstead of the stead in Lancashire said: “ Mr Ditta moved from a criminal defender to a criminal the moment he started to buy drugs from organized criminals. ”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him sensitive to the motives of leading members of organised crime who instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and inspire trust and confidence among the public.
Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the façade of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and obstacles to justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and we will take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of the conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to a total sentence of 153 years for drug-related offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, that his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Church Music Work
At the end of the festivities on the occasion of its 160-year anniversary, the song wreath of Dunningen will enframe two services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life ", which enththe spectators in the spring of this year, the wreath of the song will enrich two services with the performance of Franz Schubert's German Fair at the end of the jubilee year.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary trade fair will be held from 7 p.m. during the evening trade fair in the St. Martinuskirche in Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. at the service in the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so called German Fair with the original title " Singingings for the Celebration of the Sacred Sacrifice of the Fair ", D 872, is a spiritual work of music by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The exhibition is performed as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach – Skepticism gives way to growing confidence
The 2015 elections to the parish council will, for example, make fundamental changes in the Haslach pastoral Unit (SE).
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes.
The committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared the changes at a joint meeting on Saturday.
The basic decisions of the diocese remain unchanged any more, and it is up to the parish communities to implement them satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, skepticism about the new has reluctantly but increasingly given way to confidence.
The very constructive discussions between the six bodies and the main officials of the parish team ranged from ideas and expectations of the innovations of 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council.
Regional President Georg Schmitt explained the redefined guidelines for ministry units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
After that, the SE Haslach, as a church community, will henceforth form a public law body that will enter into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities.
There will only be one common parish council and a board of trustees on which the parish priest Kraft Office is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and so-called community teams are to be formed on site in the six parishes.
Their future task will be to promote ecclesiastical life in the area.
The question of the finances of the individual parish then showed that there was a considerable need for discussion.
New features provide for the preservation of accumulated funds in parishes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the community as a whole.
There were serious concerns about the large planned investments, the obligation of which would then apply to all the parishes.
" In the past, too, investments were only made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone, " said Haslach's parish parish chairman, Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body of the Schutterwald-Neuried care unit.
They set themselves the task in 2006 of' becoming one, staying five' and found that this is not at all easy.
The bodies of the Haslach pastoral Unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams.
The work will be fleshed out at further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six fora next spring.
In the end, the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the SeelCare Unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, the city becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to prepare for higher electricity costs.
As the Managing Director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to SUEDKURIER, a four-person Pfullendorf family will urs between 70 and 90 euros additional costs per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the EEC levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This levy is redefined every year in October by the four operators of the large lines of electricity.
These quantify the additional costs of the reversal of energy, which they can charge through a levy over the price of electricity.
The last link in the Pfullendorf is Stadtwerke Pfullendorf.
In its forecasts, the supervisory board of the energy company even assumed a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
" We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x, " Bias says, with the number closer to the 2 cents.
Permanent traffic lights on permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light is not green.
The contact loop in the road does not react, or the sign of light is defective.
What to do then - drive red?
If a person concerned has waited long enough at a red light and the crosssection is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart based lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad ".
However, the waiting time must be' reasonable', which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises stopping at least five minutes before the traffic lights are disrupted.
However, if you continue the journey in spite of red light, you must be aware that you are entirely to blame for an accident caused by it.
Whoever tolerates himself for less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes of continuous red, a driver had ignored the traffic lights and had to answer for a negligent red light offence.
The traffic lights were not broken, but jumped to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not.
The Municipal Council is pleased with a Solid Budget
Whenever the budget is at stake in local council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well.
The municipal packet in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has no longer aware of debt since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be a complete success in this sense.
This became clear when the 2012 accounts were presented.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget, at around EUR 7.6 million over EUR 1 million, was higher than planned.
The administrative budget surplus is also around EUR 1 million higher than the approach, at around EUR 1.8 million.
The surplus is mainly due to higher revenues and a local share of income tax.
The asset budget, too, was again well above the planned levels.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year.
'This is largely due to the increase in the allocation from the administrative budget,' Rothmund said.
Since less investment was made in the financial year 2012 than planned, the reserve allocation has also been higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund for her good work.
" Such a work cannot not be shaken out of the sleeve, " Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the local councils were visibly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens dearly.
In the past, due to the good financial situation, the municipality has been able to do without high lerates.
According to Gerster, however, this has often reduced subsidies from the country.
These subsidies from various compensatory sticks are conditional.
Among other things, the towns and municipalities applying for grants must have certain leverage rates.
" We need to look at the issue of leverage, because investments will have to be made in the coming years for which we would like to see subsidies, " Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermer ’ s history with the male singing association Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, during which he was solemly honored.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colours of his male singing association.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir, which has gained more than popular in the meantime.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
He immediately received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, pastoral speaker on behalf of the caescilia association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate from the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His colleagues presented him with the certificate of the German choral association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the award, the 31st autumn festival took place as usual: with the MGV Betra, the song wreath Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local Musikverein, the Vollmaringer had loaded a colourful mix of different choirs and singing styles enterentertaining around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like " Im Weinparadies " and " Lustig, ihr Brüder ".
For their honorary singer Hubert Wermter they made a little tribute - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's " Bundeslied ".
The male singing association Betra also sang classical choral songs such as " Jägerwerben " by Julius Wengert, " Wide, far away " by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song " When you pass through the valley ".
The wreath of the song Salzstetten, with its mixed choir and its women's group - the " impulse choir " - provided the women's quota for the festival.
The mixed choir with the Neapolitan folk styles Santa Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " took Antos Gus to foreign countries, while the " impulse choir " also used foreign languages: " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " were part of their programme.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein returned home with " Was isch der Schwob? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papper's " Bierlied ", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - " Grandma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a casarl theatre and read a few stories that the children had well busy at lunch.

Kenya's press outraged by controversial media law
‘ We are in a worrying situation and we can ask ourselves what is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow? ’ read the newspaper, which does not consider the draft law to be constitutional.
“ The law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it, ” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, including CapitalFM, one of Kenya ’ s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased, because it ’ s an extended arm of the government, ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy.
‘ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament, ’ he said.
According to The Star, the new law has that the government is effectively strangling the media, ” whereas The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered “ a severe blow, ” describing the draft “ draconian. ”
The adoption of the law is one of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media aroused the anger of the authorities for publishing photographs of security cameras showing the units posted to the scene of the crime allegedly robbing the luxurious shopping centre.
Police chief David KKimaiyo responded by appointing two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the subpoena after a media outcry was withdrawn.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shields and individual journalists to the tune of up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected in the event that a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “ punishment can bankrupt most radio stations. ”
Moreover, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya what it describes as a “ vibrant blogosphere. ”
If they silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they like with impunity.
“ No one will ever know, ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation who calls the Kenyan media a decisive factor of control in public life.
“ Left to their own devices, politicians will lead the country into bankruptcy and take us back to the times of hunters and collectors, ” he commented.
Kenyan legislators have already incited public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reinstated their solid salaries, of around 532,000 schillings, tax-free per month – among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for FC
The official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field did not lose its importance for the city and the football club despite the cold weather and rain.
Everyone might have wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play a it.
All those who came without an umbrella or, for some reason, could not hold one were left out.
That went to the musicians who framed the ceremony, as to many speakers.
The chairman of the FC, Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of fulfilling a dream, therefore became wet.
First of all, he would like to thank Mayor Walter Klumpp, who made a strong commitment to the implementation of the project, the Municipal Council, the companies involved and members of the association who took involved.
Especially Lothar Hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The harsh pensioners laid 400 square metres of cobblestones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the member of the parliament Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were addressed to the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the Planning Office, who announced a donation to the club ’ s youth department.
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that in spring and autumn, the recurrent weather-related influences were exerted on the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played with.
Fifteen years ago, the first reflections were given to solve the problem when consideration was given to building a third course at the football club or at Realschule on the Salinensee.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago, thought was given to the creation of an artificial turf sports ground, which was widely regarded as the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were started two years ago, when the FC took over the cablechair in Erblecht, pledged a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and approved grants of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the Municipal Council decided to bear the remaining EUR 356 000 in the total cost of EUR 560 000, summarised Klumpp.
Construction of the 68 x 108 pitch began on June 4th.
During the more than three months of construction, 3,000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which was used to create a Dirt Bike route.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on justice and home affairs issues.
The relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Amongst other things, direct democracy, bribery and the federal police.
This morning, the Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its deliberations.
This should include, among other things, the issue of dual citizenship, on which both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to put an end to pressure for German-born immigrant children to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on this Friday's Friday, the SPD underated its opposition to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
In a letter to Florian Pronold, writes to his group that a vignette would be a " flat rate for driving and thus environmentally counterproductive, " said the SPD negotiator on the subject of transport.
There was a threat of evasion on country roads, which are already the focus of accidents.
Moreover, the introduction of a toll for all cars would only be a first step from Pronold's point of view.
" There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date, " he said.

Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Forecements like this will no longer be available at Vienna Schwechat Airport in the future.
A large proportion of loudspeakers are thus eliminated - the noise level is to be reduced so significantly.
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport follows an international trend by making announcements concerning individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already renouncing the noisy calls.
The elimination of these announcements - an average of around 200 personal calls from the loudspeakers in one day - is intended to calm things down at the airport in the future.
" Experience has also shown that these individual announcements have not been noticed relatively much, but at the same time that all other information on changed flight times or departure times has been lost a little here, " says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander-Games at Kaltenhof

Milk and egg alternatives
Vegan nutrition requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
For example, pure tofu with a plant flag is a quarkz replacement.
Others are mentioned by the Vegetarian Confederation on the World Vegan Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of World Vega Day on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Association is proposing a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, replacing yoghurt with soya yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, oatmeal, almond or rice milk can be used.
breakable plant flag replaces traditional whipped cream.
There are also herbal alternatives to eggs.
For example, a half-crushed ripe banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this purpose.
Loose are dough instead of egg for example with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
50 grams of soya yoghurt or silk fu fu also serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800 000 people in Germany are currently eating vegan, in other words purely plant-based.
Sleeping New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest High School met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flying, we went straight to Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan.
There was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening.
Due to the time delay, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but according to the motto " The city does not sleep ", the day was decided in Times Square.
In spite of shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry on the second day and be reached on foot.
Then it went through the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of September 11 th.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating and large city from the 373 metre high Empire State Building viewing platform while enjoying the views.
Afterwards, the hustle and bustle of the New York streets passed the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which was an ideal opportunity to linger in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, students have arrived in their host families and experience everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year a Hubertus Fair will be celebrated on the name of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
According to the legend, St. Hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter, converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhornbläsergruppe der Jagdreiter Westfalen, led by Brigitte Kluth, plays on parforc horors (natural horns in the Es mood) according to old, originally French melodies.
The brass bands wear horseback riding clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog herds on trawling.
The solemn trade fair will take place on Sunday, November 3rd, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed open shake shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and come back again.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to the encyclopaedia, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
If you visit the cafe of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve, within sight of the university Rhine-Waal, you don't have to stop the pure feeling of Déjà Vu.
After all, this is what the cafe with its beautiful name aims to do: to make a real stay not only in terms of ideas, but also in terms of hand.
Because it's fun and beautiful.
A glance inside at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The ultra-modern but not cool café-ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team with the founders of Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the helm spoil the guest with a wide range of coffee or cocktail options.
You can also enjoy delicious cakes or individual fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves as restaurants even before the attractive café at the Opschlag opened: they ran the " Art Lounge " in Kranenburg.
From the move to Kleve at the Opschlag, friendly cafe lovers hope for more audiences.
Not least the university.
" Where we have no particular target group, " stresses Daniel Büttner tner.
On the contrary, the two here would like to address young students in exactly the same way as senior citizens and all ages in between.
Speaking of café lovers.
The friendly owner is behind coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew yourself in a wide variety of variations.
Express sofan
Daniel Büttner is the express fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker.
" For this, a baguette - that's my thing, " the NRZ will tell you.
Two events have also already taken place in the bright cafe.
Better one thing.
The fact is that the port festival was more likely to take place outside - Café Déjà Vu has not benefited from it.
But there was also Ringelnatzabend.
The two 33-year-old found " beautiful, successful and funny ".
But not everyone.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner is not a good fan of Event Evenings: " You can't please everyone ".
And with an event I only address those who are also interested in the special event.
Therefore, events will be the exception.
" We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible ".
In other words, Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products on offer here, as well as regard to the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which is becoming more and more a gastronomic part.
To the delight of many Klevers, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastronomic mile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A Day of Thankgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th anniversary of the Foundation to which the MGV " Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker " had invited this year, and 52 guests, active singers and their wives were welcome.
At the " Witteborg " restaurant in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious coexistence of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival has always been the right festivity for making honours.
This time Secretary Rolf Wagener was pleased with the special award " Singer of the Year ".
" Not only have you written a lot for us, but you have also done some rounds for us, for which our heartfelt thanks, " says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year, the awards for their participation in the performances and rehearsals by means of activity customs went to the choir conductor Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by Honorary Chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the Chairman himself, and last year's " Singer of the Year " Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
The music manager Artur Brückner ranked fifth.

The MGV " Friedrich-Wilhelm " meets every Tuesday at 7.45 p.m. on Tuesdays at the club restaurant for its regular rehearsals.
" New, cheerful voices are welcome at any time, " says Schlotmann.
UN proclaims New Objectives in Combating Poverty
From now on, the United Nations begins to develop a number of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for combating poverty, which were announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro this eiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the Millennium Development Goals that expire in 2015.
They have been included in the final draft document to be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
In the evening, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon moon told the summit that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests. ”
“ I am pleased that the member states have agreed to undertake a process aimed at reconciling universal, sustainable development goals, ” he said.
“ These goals will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 framework for development.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the member states to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the Millennium Development Goals. ”
Even though the SG Achim / Baden has been out of victory for four days of play, the mood in the handball league is still good.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that.
Everyone remains fully motivated.
However, I hope that we will finally win again.
" Because I don't know how such a victory tastes ", Malmon expects his team to succeed at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet pulled down trees, Malmon raises raising his finger beforehand.
I have trained a lot of players myself in the A-youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
" We also have to wait and see if there are any first reinforcements, " explains the SG coach.
In order finally to return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to previous appearances.
In the end, there has been a huge lack of cover work and the game of switching.
The exploitation of opportunities also definitely needs to be improved.
So I hope my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in central Maputa under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founder of the state and first president, to agree to peace calls in a rare public demonstration.
“ We want peace, we want stability, ” said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
Fearing the country ’ s future, she exchanged her clothes for a T-shirt labelled “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on the capital ’ s independence site on Thursday.
For the last two weeks there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, among the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia, and later the apartheid government of South Africa, in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government.
It became an opposition after the 1992 peace treaty.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of vast gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in investment of more than $50 billion from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Anadarko in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamos stronghold, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renama bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group ’ s leader, said Renamos told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accused of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself to be a “ loser ” who “ wants to use all his remaining powers to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government. ”
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they do not want to avoid war.
But concerns have heightened since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was giving up the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously, ” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve tensions that were fueled by a series of clashes this year.
“ We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide their heads, ” says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at Open University and a Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reform, has already said that she will boycott November ’ s local elections.
Presidential and legislative elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos election successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM) founded by a former Renama member, is likely to improve in the election.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – due to resign when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy.
“ He doesn ’ t want multi-party democracy, he doesn ’ t want transparent elections, he doesn ’ t want peace because he doesn ’ t want to give up the presidency, ” Mazanga says.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but she has made disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South link.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port that mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded cautiously as to whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique, ” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already worried about corruption, slow progress in development, and a recent wave of abduction.
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems, ” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, simply wanted stability.
“ No one cares in Renamo and Frelimo, they simply want peace and usable roads to be restored again, ” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends to be “ role models for life, ” one author says.
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks, ” and the Artus legend demonstrates the importance of having a dream.
But many of the myths are “ far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools, ” which is why Crossley Holland called for a “ careful selection ” of age-appropriate works.
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America, ” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic ” would “ completely shut down ” children, because entertaining stories convey the messages “ subliminal. ”
Crossley Holland, which has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said, “ You can have certain intentions, but you should, if possible to keep them in the background. ”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or happy-ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
It must be implicit, revealing history, not explaining.
That is the old story of showing rather than telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement in Haslach, on Sunday his last years came to life in the " Freihof ".

Their warning then made the three-kings singer who led Hansjakob to shout:' Oh how beautiful, youth memories of my own three-kings come to life again'.
With their song " O Jesulein " they rejoiced the audience in the Freihof as well as the stork day children with their loud " Out, Out Out ".
At the time, Hansjakob expressed his criticism of the Church as well as his concerns about agricultural excesses, the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war.
He found his resting place in his homeland, behind his grave chapel on fire near Hofstetten.
" A restless mind had finally found its peace of mind and had gone home forever, " they said at the end of the scene game.
There was a lot of applause and words of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of the Neckar Giants Grows
The chances of the Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players remaining in the league have increased.
If there is a wildcard procedure, there will now be one less competitor for the Neckar giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project refrains from applying for a possible seat.
" We will not participate in the wildcard process, " said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
However, we did not hear a first breath of fresh air from Ludwigsburg.
" We did not concern ourselves with the wildcard procedure as long as it is clear that Düsseldorf is not granted a licence, " said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil to our newspaper.
Until 23 May, ascer Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove his economic Bundesliga suitability.
Until now, the Rhine countries have been refused a licence twice.
The Arbitration Court is the last resort.

Black shimmers the coal on the camp in front of the dike.
Two huge blue stockpile and rechargers distribute or load the coal here as required.
Every time the terminals move, a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
" The signals serve safety and are required by law, " says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, when the wind is unfavorable, this is widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city order.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now keeping the warning signals quieter by means of technical measures.
He will continue to rely on open dialogue with neighbours.
Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on the import of coal-fired for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the sunbed in front of the terminal, which is deepened to 18.5 metres, capize bulk carriers can long since be handled here.
" This year we want to crack the 3 million tonne mark, " says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, imported coal goes to power stations inland.
If the GDF Suez power plant goes to the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year will be realistic.
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bavaria ’ s Basketball optimism despite its first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the enormous optimism of the FC Bayern Munich basketball players.
" Nobody can prohibit us from believing we can win against the best team in Europe in the last two years, " said Bavarian coach Svetislav Pesic after the unhappy 83: 88 (39: 47) on Thursday evening with title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their only third appearance in the European premier class, the Munich sold very well for a long time, but were simply not sufficiently clarified in the decisive phases.
Guests managed to turn a 15-point lag into a guided tour 13 minutes before the end before Piraeus turned the game again.
" We fought unbelievably back against the two-time Euroleague-Champion, but then made reckless mistakes again, " said Bavarian professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of the Munich players, who had celebrated significant victories in the first two matches against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, variable artist Frank Fay, who worked as Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the crowd jokes directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay ’ s innovation has expanded, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“ Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more successful until they were became known to perform in a club, ” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year ’ s event will feature performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy charity event for army evetans in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of the comedians taking part in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional channels, such as programmes on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a cable TV sitcom (the ironic fantasy fantasy football series “ The League ” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the line-up at both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known known her viral video series, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaumau Bell focused on race issues) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has become a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted TV Land TV show entitled “ Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg ”.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“ The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry ’ s entire work, ” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he is here he sometimes walks through the street between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, perhaps I live here.
Iran Satisfied with the Nuclear Negotiations Process
Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process with the five UN powers and Germany one week before the next nuclear meeting.
" After years of reaching an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years, " Foreign Minister Mohamed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
There is still a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that both sides will end up with a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: boys kill playmates with machetes
Two children admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two boys, who were 14 and 12, had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives on Tuesday, they threw the body into a well, according to the newspaper' El País' on Thursday.
They would then have played football in front of their homes in a working-class district.
The corpse was found the following night in the locality of Cerro Pelado, 15 km north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the young who had taken her with her was supposed to say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the walk before the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
One of the reasons given was rivalry in the football match.
He was provisionally admitted to a psychiatric youth institute.
Pimps Must Go to jail
The Konstanz District Court has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison for exploiting human trafficking, pimping, threats, insult and dangerous bodily injury.
The former German soldier, who worked as a doorstand after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial agreement.
In five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with force and threats.
He retained the income of the women, some of whom had been raising for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undermined women ’ s contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated women, he took them to various brothels in the south-west.
He had some of them monitored there in order to control their revenue.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he suffsuffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan next to him had died in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert suggested serious doubts about mental restraint, and thus about limited guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to listen to any of the women affected.
As one Kripo official reported, at least four other cases of exploitative trafficking in human beings have been identified following initial notification by telephone surveillance.
A great deal of aggression characterised the eavesdropping talks.
In later interrogations, the injured parties would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered blue spots on the whole body, had made no statement to this day.
He is' a completely broken person' who considers violence and exploitation in this animal to be normal.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
" He has dissociated himself from these circles and wants to lead a normal life after imprisonment, " he said.
The price of oil continues to reach up to USD 96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference timber variety for deliveries in December fell by 14 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange in e-commerce in Europe to USD 96.24 per barrel in the late morning.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, representing a 5.8% drop in October.
The large supply of raw oil has weighed down prices in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy declared on Wednesday that US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there were indications of increased demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This suggests a continued recovery in China ’ s economy, which grew to 7.8% in the third quarter, after its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude oil, a reference value for international crude oil also used by US refineries, fell on the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Court of Justice is blocking the NYPD's Stop-and-Risk Policy
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Appeal in the US blocked the appointment of a judge calling for changes to the New York Police Department ’ s stop and crisis program (“ stop and search ”), and dismissed the judge from the case.
The Second US Court of Appeal declared that Judge Shira Scheindlin ’ s decisions would be suspended until a city appeal had been decided.
The judge judged in August that the city was in breach of the Constitution with the way in which the programme for stopping and interrogating people was being implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments calling for suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge must be relieved of the case of violaching the Code of Conduct for US judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality, partly based on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the Court ’ s criticism.
The judge had judged that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were unduly targeted at targeting black and Latin American men with the stop and crisis programme.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy, training and supervision reforms, and ordered a pilot programme with body-borne cameras in neighbourhoods where most checks were carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people released after police control.
An oral hearing on the vocation of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop and risk tactic has been criticised by a number of civil rights advocates.
Such controls have existed in various forms for decades, but during the non-partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg ’ s tenure, the number of recorded rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, complaints were lodged by four men belonging to all minorities, which turned into collective redress.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop and risk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as influence how other police officers use the system.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morality of the police, not crime; nor would money be wasted or solve the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure following the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it does not end the stop-and-risk practice that is constitutional, but only reform the way in which the NYPD implemented controls.
The Happiness of the Dreamy Camels
Happiness is an oasis that can only reach dream camels.
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the " Helfende Hands " association.
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which has already had considerable success.
The first chairman Henne reported extensively about the work of the association.
He himself was first in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed-Hospital in Nouakchott.
Subsequently, further cooperation developed and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on the ground during several journeys.
During the speeches, pictures of the stakes were shown on a big screen, so that the guests of the jubilee event could get an idea of the above-mentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association has also been shown.
It is a former Federal Border Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, Nagold ’ s former OB, had proposed equipping this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and, according to Henne, now plans to act as an advisory capacity with the association.
In 2008, Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn set up the sickbay in Socogim, a slums on the edge of the capital, in record time of less than a week - volunteer.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the obstetrics clinic in Nagold is to be nationalized.
There is much to be learned in Africa as a doctor, according to Henne, for example burn-out slowing down.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many journeys as planned, but many physicians came to Germany to study in various areas.
In addition, containers containing material are regularly sent to Africa, for example in March of this year medical devices, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself supplied plenty of local colour by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile brick stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim ’ s musicians, who traditionally support the association, on their trip to Mauritania.
As his personal motives, he referred to his work in the field of auditing as a young Member of Parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost en route, he decided to help Africans control a popular budget.
Fox also stressed that the global economy demands global human love.
Nor should we forget that Africa is closer than some people think.
Not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check tips.
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “ telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip about an affair involving then-Minister of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser, ” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned and pursued Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack Pawlby ’ s voice emails, but Coulson also called her and left behind news, as the court learned.
“ In the opinion of the public prosecutor ’ s office, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is no one standing in front of people ’ s homes and hoping to catch them for fresh action, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction, ” Edis explained.
He said that NotW uses three methods to conduct investigative research into stories: telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the second, monitoring, it cannot be otherwise.
The first?
Is he aware of the hacking of phones?
He denies that, but we say, “ And if he knew it. ”
Rumors of a Clarke affair were first picked up by NotW ’ s feature editors, when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was told, “ Do not waste your time, it is together with Charles. ”
A band of voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was insured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective ’ s computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects. ”
During the time the research was was ongoing, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Pawlby ’ s movements.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her with a voicemail saying, “ I have a story that we want to release tomorrow, that I would like to talk to Charles about. ”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important figures, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted a married woman because of an affair when he himself had lifted with the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had then been married.
Coulson and Brooks refuse to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted telephone hacking.
Indeed, in protest at the planned wealth tax, French football will go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting comes to an end without results.
In the conflict over the wealth tax, the government and professional football in France have manoeuvred themselves into an impasse following a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of the associations and associations at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and listened to their complaints.
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75% levy on income of more than €1 million per year, which all the country ’ s companies are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side, too, remained tough.
Jean-Pierre Louvel, head of the Professional Club (UCPF) that the strike announced for the end of November will now be carried through.
The match days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 scheduled for 29 November and 2 December are therefore cancelled.
: No Absolute Protection
" We want to involve the residents in the planning at an early stage ", Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants came to the municipal hall to have the planned measures explained, to ask questions, to express concerns and to contribute ideas.
Häußler made it clear: " The final decisions are taken by the members of the local council ".
The floods that hit Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009 were a major event, which raised the question of protective measures for the future, Häußler said.
A river basin investigation was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the concept of flood protection in Gechingen.
" The protection of as many cultivated plots of land as possible is the goal, " says Häußler.
The planning of the protection against floods that are statistically expected every 100 years according to the German weather service is based.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In experts this is called " HQ 100aKlima ".
The water masses, which caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, were in line with 1000 years of flooding.
" There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement, " he said.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros need to be invested in Gechingen, whereby the municipality can count on national subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, Häußler pointed out that support only exists if an overall concept is implemented.
To this end, the community needs the participation of citizens.
Extensive planning and approval procedures will have to be completed.
At best, implementation can begin in 2016.
Among other things, the concept of protection, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported), provides for local measures in the infx of the river Irm from the Stammheim Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute.
Among other things, questions have been asked as to why more dams and reservoirs are not planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned Wald and Corbe engineering offices in Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needs the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired objective.
It is also necessary to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
There was resentment among people living near the Algate, who repeatedly suffer from congestion of the channel network, even in the event of normal thunderstorms.
The problem is well known in administration and initial measures have already been taken.
Häußler, however, pointed out that the directives for canal systems were different from those for flood prevention, and that this should not be mixed up.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way as to cope with two to three year rain events.
Larging the sewers would devour millions.
Seriously injured after Clash
In the early Friday afternoons, two drivers were seriously injured in a head-on collision on the state road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could not say much at first about the accident.
There are, however, various testimonies that should first be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old steering wheel of a VW Golf drove in the direction of Revensdorf and that the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so severely trapped that it took the fire brigade less than half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
At first, the real cause of the accident remained unresolved.
Both injured came to nearby hospitals.
The route remained closed for about two hours.
He could be called Dostoevsky in the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysicist, his novels and narratives also have something serious.
Amazing is the kinship in the exterior: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who has something at home.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories sells two thousand people.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, obsession with security, and belief in choice.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, had inflicted drugs on his brain.
He grasped, early on, that the computers are different.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a human being from a machine, the Creator from his creation.
That is the Blade Runner.
The killing.
Master of science fiction.
A fantastic novelist.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This saga is now particularly significant.
The " Minors Report " dates back to 1956 and exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals.
The principle of' pre-crime',' pre-crime', is being developed here, which has become the more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's frighteningly resembles ours, mutants are looking to the future - and the police are approaching.
" We record individuals who have not infringed any law, " says the head of the authority.
'We grab them before they can commit a violent crime'.
And:' There are no serious criminals in our society, we have a criminal camp full of pesudo criminals'.
They assume that bad happens and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dicick's narrative looks like the blueprint for anti-terrorism laws and the NSA interception frenzy.
Anticipation of the attack: this is how Obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dicks story is not yet over.
The Chief of Police complains that there is no longer any separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what remains of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system.
It is perfect, but it lies.
It invents its own preconditions.
Not only do errors and victims accept, they are based on them.
The system creates the danger that it combats.
Reading Philip K. Dick means constantly getting closer to the truth.
Late cases testifying about Merkel in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make Russian asylum statements in the late case surrounding US Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Bar Association could either ask questions in writing or also meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, according to the agency Interfax.
Prior to that, a member of the Green Parliament, Hans-Christian Ströbele, was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to discuss the affair with him.
NSA revelations reinforce state-controlled corporate paranoia
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany ’ s capital of finance.
At the behest of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism (BVT), the German Interior Intelligence Service, he was to photograph the roof of the US Foreign Office located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas, and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German State Department in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted in September that the US did not use foreign espionage “ to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profits. ”
But since Edward Snowden, the former employee who has became whistleblowers, began publishing his filltain of US surveillance secrets, governments and corporate bosses have no longer been sure that they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has spy on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have taken corporate paranoia to a new level of government surveillance.
The camel ’ s back broke the revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone had been woven up, perhaps for a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, management is certainly potential.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“ Germany must wake up, ” explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe, according to a survey published by EY, that the US now poses almost as great a risk as China in terms of industrial espionage and data theft.
In Snowden's leaked documents, however, there has been no evidence that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU should lack certain IT and Internet opportunities and reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are sceptical about this.
The Bundestag suggested that we should build a German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and reopen them slowly...
“ This is not how it works, ” says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of German software manufacturer SAP.
If we had wanted a strong European IT industry, we should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything with the exception of the IT industry.
Yet the reach and technical subtlety of the US spy authorities uncovered by Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing, as European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurisdiction there and is therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, following revelations about US data mining activities with Prism, around 10% of non-US members discarded plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy CEO of SAP, says, “ We see a new question from customers that did not exist a year ago – it is: where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this legal area? ”
Many German business leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and must therefore be guarded at all costs.
Economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
This has always been the case.
“ It was a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed as a result of the current discussion, ” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate governance does not usually boast the remedies that have been taken, because that benefits attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been instillled that it is not advisable to take a free USB stick at a trade fair or leave a laptop safely in the hotel room, to put it mildly.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of directors of car manufacturers Audi, says that for years it has been standard practice to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
Prepaid phones are thrown away.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in niches.
“ Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, human resources and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorised access, ” the BVT warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post in February, the US National Intelligence Estimate ranked France, Russia, and Israel second behind China among the countries that used to obtain economic hacking data.
A member of the board of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to industrial espionage, “ the French are the worst. ”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France ’ s DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month: “ Intelligence services know very well that even if all countries work together in the fight against terrorism, they spy on their allies. ”
Hechingen: Messe answers wedding questions
" marriage is the most important journey of discovery man can make, " said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding ceremony can succeed have been given to a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important vendors around a wedding.
A trend: the retro look has returned.
This starts with the wedding clothes, for example.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In the front, the often embroidery clothes are closed, often with a veil, while in the back they go their back and often end in a tow.
However, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes the fashion house Kleidermüller, the spirits are divided there.
In men the suit with waistcoat and Plastron dominates, but cream or brown combinations can also be chosen.
Important is the selection of the restaurant, has been explained.
There was a lot of noise from the street.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in a remake.
If you want to ride a horse-drawn carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
" carriages are also popular with young people, " he says.
Romanticism is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements, as well as for wedding paintings.
The " After-Wedding Photo " is becoming more and more fashionable - recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sundays.
Flower arrangements, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a wizard, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not forgetting the right cosmetic and nail care.
All you need for an unforgettable celebration.
Successful Dog Friends
For the second time, the sportsmen of the dog friends Bitz were successful at a Rally-Obedience-tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner and scored fifth, and with the 15-month-old Marley he finished 12th with 87 points.
Susi Höpp faced the critical eye of the referee with her Class 1 woody.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled ring mat in the gymnasium of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, said the family ’ s lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found in a upright mat behind the gallery on 11 11 in the Schulturnhalle.
The Sheriff of Lowndes County investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which casts doubt on the 17-year-old family.
“ Convinced that their son was murdered, ” explained Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson ’ s lawyer, ” told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he had died as the sheriff concluded.
“ They believe that there is no logic in violating the laws of physics as well as common sense, ” Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being covered up in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“ Her son went to school to learn and came back in a body bag, ” he comments.
US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into Johnson ’ s death, because a number of important questions remain open.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death attributable to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whichever direction they lead.
My aim is to find out the truth.
“ I believe there is sufficient basis for formal investigation, ” he said.
Moore told reporters that initial autopsy suggested that Johnson died as a result of “ position suffocation. ”
But a second autopsy produced another cause of death, Moore argues.
“ There are a number of questions to be answered or confirmed, ” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson ’ s death, he will instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff Authority was not immediately prepared to comment in response to our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to release all surveillance videos checked by the investigators.
The teenager ’ s parents said that they hoped that the video recordings would indicate how he had died.
CDC Publish School Allergy Guidelines
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with children ’ s food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases.
One child in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to the CDC, food allergies among children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools aimed at raising awareness among faculty and staff of food allergies and how to deal with children with allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrin in stock – the EpiPen brand ’ s auto injection is most commonly used – to counter a potentially lethal hypersensitivity reaction.
State legislators have recently changed the rules to make it easier for schools for Epinephrin to keep stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with allergic reactions.
Children may say, ‘ It feels like something is pressing on my tongue ’, ‘ My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it ’ or ‘ My tongue is crawling ’.
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ gender ”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with unambiguous genitals.
Newborn babies are no longer rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare a sex to be such children, but can indicate ‘ indeterminate ’ or ‘ not specified ’ on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to relieve the pressure from parents not to have to make hasty decisions on gender allocation operations in newborn babies and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
An intersexual person said, according to the BBC, years later, “ I am neither a man nor a woman. ”
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is not born each year as a boy or girl.
They are intersexual, a group covered by the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Valais Simpson may have been intersexual.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US recommend that the best available information should be used for gender allocation if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding – if at all – for surgery.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said that the new German law “ sounds like a good cause. ”
Inter-sexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“ Some people have life-threatening illnesses that require surgery, but most children do not, ” he said.
You can assign gender without an operation and then see how your identity develops.
Scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity at all is not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it is happening.
It is a secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission stated that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defines both simultaneously or clearly as one of them.
These characteristics were reflected in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosomstructures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in working life, as well as of the extent of harassment, violence and crime of prejudice.
Boys who do not correspond to the gender picture now have a special camp.
Meanwhile, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate male, female, or “ third sex ” on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ genderless ” person after a court granted life-long “ undefined ” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German cards will in future have a third allocation, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French deputies from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “ gender theory ” from textbooks.
The US website Catholic Online has also opposed German law, on the grounds that “ When the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we distort two more pillars of civilization. ”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she thought it was better to assign a sex to babies at birth.
“ Parental existence is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your child, ” she told the parents ’ website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both men and women have been called hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
As recently as ten years ago, medicine regarded gender as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But now that the ethical fundamentals of an operation know how complex gender identity is, and now that doctors may be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when they grow up with the sex they assign it, they are being questioned.
“ The mid-twentieth century was called a “ psychiatric emergency, ” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist who was called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unambiguous genitals stems from Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender was formable.
He coined the term “ gender identity, ” arguing that social and environmental initiatives – how parents raise a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones, shaping whether a person considers himself male or female.
But a 1966 case known as “ John / Joan ” made his theories controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off during a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then bring him up as a girl.
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of transformation that it was not, ” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he returned to the male sex and married a woman.
At the age of 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practise this model.
But in the 1990 ’ s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender operations, which are “ unhappy with the outcome, ” came to light.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36 year-old Montana author born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.
Doctors were not know whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and raised as a girl.
At 12 age he received female hormones.
“ I knew I was not a girl, ” he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was to be given a vaginal plastic.
But being depressed and knowing that something was wrong, he called for his medical files.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born – and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genitals.
After learning the truth, he returned to male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation has made it infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called the Interface Project to see intersexual people as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of California-based Advocates for Informed Choice legal group, worries that German law “ “ encourage stamping and stigmatisation. ”
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision might encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign “ not fixed ” to the child, ” she explained.
We fear encouraging intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we do not yet know what the impact of the law, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law, because “ it allows adults to recognize the third sex. ”
“ Adults should be able to make their own legal gender choices, ” she explained.
German law is about allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force young children into at this stage.
Once they have grown up, they can decide for themselves on their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast diologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that German law “ empowers ” both parents and children.
Katie, daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete drug resistance.
Katie has developed female characteristics due to the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone.
It has a vagina, but it has no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie 29 is married; she works as a child psychiatry employee at the University of Pennsylvania.
It is infertile, but it hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“ The law gives room to parents, so they don ’ t have to make decisions hastily, ” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do different tests and sort things out, giving them time before they write “ male ” or “ female. ”
In this way, everything is fine – you pull the child big and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy your parental happiness.
And you do not have to rush into an operation that can no longer be undone.
“ This includes children in the decision and remoates the fear that pervades parents because they do not think they are doing the right thing, ” she explained.
At the end of the day, it is the child who decides the sex that suits him better – and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own choices.
Unknown hurt Girls by Shot from a Car
Unknown have injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in bullets from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired at a group of children with an air pressure weapon on Thursday evening in Genthin.
That is what the police in the castle told us.
The girl was slightly injured on the left.
Rescue workers took the girl to hospital.
The shot came from a small car that passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc.
They then drove away from it.
The criminal police are being investigated, they said on Friday.
To date, the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were only called to throw children twice, throwing them at house facades.
Since the owners recognized this in good time and removed the remains of the eggs, no material damage is likely to have been caused.
In addition, a number of New Year's Eve bols may have been lit in the city area, but no material damage has been caused either.
A resident of the Bishop Friendship Way reported that his car was wrapped in a knock paper and his whedar flashes were stolen.
By the time the police arrived, however, the man found all his radar flashes in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to take any further action.
Living with Future
Actually Waltraud Ries lives dreamlike.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of greenery, an old tree population, a nice neighbour and also not too much traffic.
It is only a few minutes away from the city centre by public transport.
" You are hopefully not afraid of spiders? " asks Waltraud Ries pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new flat for my husband and myself for some time.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider ’ s phobia, but the concern that she will no longer be able to cope with the many steps to the house and the flat in old age.
Moreover, since a menisk operation, the mid-fifties has experienced at first hand what it means to move from floor to floor.
She has just published a book on the subject of' Happily living in old age - Which form of housing is the best for me?'
'Our flat is the best example of what is not possible in old age', she begins to tell us.
When she moved with her husband to the duplex apartment more than 20 years ago, it was simply a beautiful apartment surrounded by greenery.
Today at the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
She also knows, however, that she is one of the few people ever to deal with the issue of housing in old age.
Most displace it as long as possible.
Only the others are always old, " she says smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you think.
'Then it can be too late, however,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 models of living for a self-determined home in old age.
'Which form of living you choose, however, is always an individual decision' she explains.
D i e solution there is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford the old age pension in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also fall ill.
And:' Without a good knowledge of the national language you can unite in the Dolce ce Vita,' the author of the specialist book will consider expulsion.
Among their models you will find classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the frequently cited pensioners.
In old age, everyone has their own ticks and ticks.
'For me, however, such a shared flat would be nothing', she says with a wink.
Certainly not like a student with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
" In old age you simply need your own areas of retreat, " says Ries.
The author of the book does not want to rule out the possibility that a community of senior citizens can still function.
However, this should not be the same as in the classical student WG.
And sometimes you just want your peace of mind, " she believes.
She is not alone in this opinion, at least in the capital of the country.
" Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as they can " is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, Head of Civic Service Life at the age of the state capital.
Your service advises people on the subject of' getting older'.
That is why the experience of the Foundation Warentest, in particular, would often accept inconvenience and restrictions simply in order to be able to stay in their familiar environment.
Today there are many possibilities to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who are involved in the renovation of their house or flat according to their age should first obtain detailed information and not hire the first best craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversion.
Some things can even be done in the rental flat, and if it is only the elevation of the toilet seat, the interior designer clarifies.
But the existing apartment cannot always be redesigned according to age and thus without barriers, no matter how beautiful it may be.
Waltraud Ries had to experience this.
The room was a bit small, but it was clean and comfortable.
She will continue searching until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she is more horrified than in front of the spider on her home door.
The US Want to continue to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence official Edward Snowden.
He is still accused of providing unauthorised secret information.
So he has to face criminal proceedings in the US, said the US State Department spokesperson, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Nor would Snowden ’ s recent statements.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbeles statements are those of a member of parliament and not those of a German member of the government.
Intelligence thriller Edward Snowden is ready to talk to the German authorities.
First of all, however, he wants his situation to be clarified.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the USA in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded on to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the German lawyer General.
The letter, according to a translation disseminated by Ströbele, is as follows:
Those responsible
I have been asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden, who previously worked contracted or directly as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the United States ’ Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In working in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I faced a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum that the Russian Federation grants me under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials - including the United States - have judged revelations about a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is accountable to no one as a public service.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously covert abuse of public confidence.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear, while at the same time the risks taken visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a loyalty and seeks to criminalise and indicute political expression.
Yet telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this harmful attitude.
I hope that, once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and in accordance with the law.
I look forward to a meeting with you in your country once the situation has been clarified and I thank you for your efforts to respect international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten found a Private Buyer
" The building is in good hands, " says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The Municipality sold the former kindergarten in the Gartenstraße to a private person.
At its most recent meeting, the local council approved the sale in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a " reasonable " price.
" The community is satisfied " Maier.
EUR 100 000 had been earmarked for in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is entitled to say that Winterlingen handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house like heating, looking after the garden and clearing footpath.
" This effort is gone, " says Maier.
Concerto at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When the conductor Bianca Willmann raises the clock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees Celsius.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
Chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music.
Honeck thanked all those who helped to successfully master the first musician's hock.
Report: Obama ’ s Campaign considered replacing Bides with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise given to the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 Double Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, and she reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had held “ extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011, ” to see if dropping Bides looks better for Obama ’ s waning hope of re-election.
According to Jonathan Martin, a Times nation-political correspondent, the book accurately traces the history of the efforts of senior campaign and White House, notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact on the poll figures of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for the vice-president.
The potential change was a tightly guarded mystery within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley, Obama ’ s former campaign leader, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the envisaged changeover.
“ Double Down ” claims that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange bids, despite her “ close personal relationship, ” before finally opting against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances. ”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“ I said a whole range of things to consider, and that was one of them, ” Daley told the magazine.
It is important to remember that the President had terrible polls at the time, so we thought, “ For God ’ s sake, what are we doing? ”
While Daley described the investigations as “ due diligence, ” Martin told CNN ’ s Anderson Cooper that considerable efforts had been made during the re-election campaign to determine whether such a move would pay off in terms of the ballot box.
“ Campaigns do not spend so much money on surveys and focus groups unless you think seriously about something, ” Martin explained on AC360.
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering exchanges.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential changeover.
Although Daley declared that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” for Obama to know about it.
Martin added that “ double down ” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether political explorations had reached Obama ’ s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama was unaware of the investigations into whether bides should be dropped in the election.
“ Possible, ” Martin replied.
What happens to my email en route?
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
Has e-mail technically implemented postal secrecy in the design of the Internet service, in the same way as conventional postal services?
In the conception of early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
That is why the basic technical protocols have failed to provide a solid basis for correspondence.
As a result, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If the user sends a mail " Anna " to " Benni ", are the computers of the two directly connected?
The first step of Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if it has a mail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends content to the provider using Benni.
On the route, the mail can run via a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content from his / her provider.
Are conventional e-mails on their way through the net?
Most mails are read several times on the way by software robots.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail is accompanied by a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, providers check whether this is an annoying and unsolicited spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do robots have another task?
On systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google may display links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the emails?
The likelihood that unauthorized people will read a mail is extremely slim.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
The law enforcement authorities and the secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against reading?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With great technical effort it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not easy to identify who communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the e-mail market in Germany?
According to an investigation by Convios Consulting in August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo Mail had recently fallen, GMail from Google was able to increase significantly.
Mother Mother in the Forest and Pensions
When his mother died, a Wolfsburg man made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and allowances.
In order to be able to continue to collect pensions and care allowances, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after a police investigation.
At first, he covered up the deaths of the 89-year-olds, and then he collected the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as one spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected as early as May: it was striking then that medicines were no longer needed for the dependent mother.
Investigators told the pensioner that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to ascertain.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common flat for more than 15 years and that he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
An obstruction, according to the police, did not provide any evidence of a capital crime.
Feel like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first gleaming ice – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a bright treat from them.
He came up with the idea after reading research into jellyfish and persuading Chinese scientists to produce the luminous protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue during consumption, increasing the pH in the protein and triggering the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and lights – so the more you lick, the lighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, says, “ The product is unbelievable, but at a very early production stage, so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds. ”
The protein used in ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice lights up.
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to us to launch it on Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made, because the jellyfish luminaire is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's Bristol based experimental company is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says ‘ I want to develop an invisible ice cream ’.
This is impossible in itself because of the refrain in light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we can find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish made by Chinese scientists.
After six days of playing, the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association league.
Now, of all things, the Ingo Ehlers team will be facing the derby against the TSV Daverden tomorrow, which celebrated its first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts again.
" I hope that we will finally have our heads free, " Ehlers is cautiously optimistic.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his complete board at his disposal.
Like us, Daverden also relies on tempo games.
That is why we must keep our error rate down.
First and foremost, however, we need to increase the level of cover that has recently left anything but a certain impression.
Daverden coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that ’ s why we are far from the favorite, because everything can always happen in the derby.
However, Panitz now wants to add something to Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
This is why A-Jugendliche Joost Windßuß, who is active with double playing rights at the A-Youth Bundesliga HC Bremen, is celebrating his seasonal debut.
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was small, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late, and disguise ourselves for the neighborhood.
Today, I have become more of a halloween muffler.
Over the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home, and I will not do so this year either.
But according to the statistics I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million, to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and decorations, according to the US Retailers Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
According to the NRF, costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year, inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that the Daft-Punk space runers will make it into the instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, batman, pirates, and witches.
I suspect nothing is wrong.
We disguised our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise.
Indeed, according to the NRF, Americans spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on this this year, says The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, slippers, canets and rubber bears.
So good news for the, according to the US Department of Commerce, 41 million people wandering through the neighborhood with the slogan “ sweet or sour. ”
Indeed, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us delude ourselves – eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet candy corn, yet 15 million kilograms are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Conectionery Manufacturers.
That is about nine billion corn seeds.
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it splashes.
They have great names such as ‘ Terror Behind the Walls ’ (which, by the way, is in real prison), ‘ Howl-O-Scream ’ and ‘ The House of Shock ’.
Indeed, there are 1,200 officially recognized Spuccas in the United States that earn $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, including the wonderful photos you are peeing into your pants and then putting friends on Facebook, where you cannot get rid of them, and then leaving the type you are on with a comment like “ nice facial expression. ”
But let us finally move on to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and carving a pumpkin lamp is like adorning the Christmas Tree – something we did from a very young age.
Fortunately, the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend only began last year, thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up with carving the pumpkin up, not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, says the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lamp, slowly rotting in the front garden, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something nice from their 921 kilogram pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue carry charred corpse
The fire brigade had to leave HelHelmbrechts late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire during the night for Friday.
The rescue services are pulling a charred body out of the house.
Rescue found a charred body in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a inhabitant is still unclear, as one police spokesman in Bayreuth.
Late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already striking out of a window.
The forces of intervention went into the apartment and found the corpse in a room.
This and another room completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, said the police spokesman.
The building is uninhabitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was unclear at first.
Germany ’ s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
Background is a possible parish shortage: The Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover expects the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors to halve according to the current situation by 2030.
For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine.
For the first time, the Landeskirche has commissioned a pastor on a full place to inspire young people to study theology.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study theology after their baccalaureate.
Bures attribute this to the process of secularisation: " God's voice is quiet, the world is loud ".
Great freedom and diversity characterise the profession.
I am the master of my calendar and I can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors, as pastors, could be very close to humans.
They earned as much as teachers and could live on it.
To be sure, more is paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer.
This meets the needs of today's young people, who are not only concerned with a career, but also with meaningful work.
According to the state church covering three-quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors currently retire each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a degree of theology start their victar ’ s office.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas, such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Amongst other things, castles want to organise study days for young people and also to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology offers a broad education.
It is even possible to become President of the Federal Republic.
Land Rover Rally Series
The interiors feature racetracks and six-point belts, as well as a hands-free system.
Options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support for Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support, to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “ The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed. ”
They are not all experienced cyclists, but people in search of excitement and adventure, as well as an reachable path to world-class events.
We are pleased to open up this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the strain and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship.
The Defender Challenge also offers a day of training and testing in February as well as the option of taking part in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called to save a bitch stuck 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous rock promontory in a quarry.
Cockerspaniel-bitch Ruby had run away after a minor road accident.
Three days later, it was discovered by a walker in the quarry in its predicament.
Fire fighters shut themselves off on the rock face and saved the dog from certain death.
The fire brigade succeeded in bringing to safety a bitch stuck on a 15-metre high lead in a rock wall.
The nine month-old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone for three days before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 to whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and thank the firemen of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately looked for their missing bitch and published calls for help on social networks when she entered the quarry after the minor road accident.
At about 2: 15 pm on Wednesday, a walker carrying out his dog saw the stranded ruby on the 15 metre high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team at Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot to rescue Rubys, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, the technical rescue team ’ s rescue team, said, “ She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock face – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her salvation – she was like stiff frozen.
It is doing well.
She ate some cakes.
That was quite unusual.
The fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical bailout team, said, “ Ruby had a huge accident. ”
It was possible that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “ Watching the rescue was frightening. ”
I could not believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back in their arms.
The veterinarian said that if exhaustion had become too great and collapsed, it would probably have fallen.
The fire fire-fighters have done a great job.
What they did was really bold.
We are so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “ We were afraid that it would fall, but it remained at the top. ”
The fire-fighters were great.
I can ’ t believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never visited Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she had worked as a background singer on Jagger ’ s 2004 song, Old Habits The Hard.
Perry explained that she eaten dinner with the Altrocker and that “ he ordered me when I was 18. ”
She added, “ It ’ s a long time ago and he was very nice to me. ”
In a statement, a representative Jagger, 70, said on Thursday that he “ categorically denies that he had ever made approaches to Katy Perry. ”
The representative added, “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance during this year's Rolling Stones tour.
Their new album “ Prism ” immediately reached number one this week.
George Kerevan: European Unbundling Gives the Scots Choice
A new day, a new story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the Hadrian Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the potential economic benefits that more freedom to travel would bring to the rest of Europe, but this did not matter in the headlines, as expected.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more favourable to them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued disregard for Brussels would be a small concession in exchange for what they really want from the Scots.
So not really a story.
And one that has already come over the years that it already resembles a fossil: for the first time I heard the “ independence means passport control ” duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient saga.
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance to European tune?
Why exchange the London yoke for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
That is the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled.
The European project officially died with the euro crisis.
Parties are gaining ground across the EU that are anti-EU or that want to abandon the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany Party – founded only this year – was able to win just under five million votes in the September federal election, effectively evicting the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Many people believe that the European project has gone too far because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, linked with the straitjacket into which the national economy is forced by adherence to the single currency.
The euro ’ s crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budget deficits – and only in Greece.
Instead, the euro system has nailed its members into exchange rates that benefit German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to leave.
Without the possibility of depreciation of the local currency, southern Europe finds itself at a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only way forward is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems there is a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much electricity as four times the United States.
This is a crialysing cost disadvantage, as we saw in Grangemouth.
All wage world's wage limits do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being sidelined by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is emerging, especially in France, the EU's former cheerleader.
After the war, France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle for containing Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, which is what the battered French economy has to contend with.
The result: Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive by-election, relegating the ruling Socialists to third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that division on the right will automatically benefit the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newfound popularity among working-class white French?
It wants to use next year's EU elections to forge an anti-EU anti-currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is perfectly possible – then such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
This is the point I would like to make: in the not-too-distant future, growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something more like the “ Europe of (sovereign) nations ” favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold fast to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the United States.
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
What has happened to Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the final analysis) Lesser England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can get stuck in and where.
I suspect that Scotland could do very well in a looser European grouping, provided that we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, remarkably – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011, owing to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem-Coalition were responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now only to get austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach adolescence rather than their white peers, as research shows.
Physical Changes do not yet directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity triggers early puberty.
The trend towards early adolescence is less pronounced among boys
The former CNN correspondent, Pat Etheridge, is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter grows breasts and hair at the age of seven or eight?
At this week ’ s annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is not a sign that puberty is now taking place quickly, ” Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious signs of developments, such as growing breasts, shame and armpits and body odors, are found earlier in girls.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (occurrence of the first regular blood) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, a little less than 12.75 in 1970.
“ When the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years to reach Menarche, ” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “ Early Puberty in Girls: The essential guide on how to deal with this common problem ”.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
What is indeed the beginning of adolescence is controversial, but breast enlargement is accompanied by a surge in growth before the age of eight years ago is “ premature. ”
In most cases, the process slows or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
If progress is made faster, tests by an dictronologist may be necessary to eliminate serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and ward t another consequence: premature bone aging, which can ultimately lead to inhibition of growth and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication, but he admits: “ Suppressing adolescence can alleviate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings, unlike being their peers. ”
The other major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side, ” Kaplowitz said.
“ It was a shock, ” recalls a woman whose daughter, at the age of ten, got her days.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of premature adolescence.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are the cause.
Boys, like girls, enter adolescence in the past.
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the obesity epidemic.
He supported conducting a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine that links body fat to entry into adolescence.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors involved.
In that country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different ways of explaining this.
Globally, early adolescence seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to the climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys with hair of their face and shame grows earlier, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as strong as that of girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and shame hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
“ We must be careful about identifying the true beginning of puberty, ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to consult their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“ This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected, ” Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than expected.
Jumbo manufacturers are arguing about the width of seats in the face of large orders.
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the breadth of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at this month ’ s Dubai Airshow.
The dispute revolves around the range of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those most sought after by airlines, but this designated space is the key to efficiency claims on the newest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
This week, Airbus demanded an industry standard requiring at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but US arch-rival Boeing says that this is for the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their long-haul twin-engine aircraft and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the back of the aircraft is designed – particularly whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic outcomes that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design is supposed to deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernised “ 777X ” has a capacity of 406 people in tourist seats with a width of 17 inches, allowing ten per row.
Airbus states that the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 people in 18 inches wide tourist seats, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share blows about technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could mark the start of a new ad war, showing donors a picture in which three people are squeezed together in a restaurant with the title: “ Would you accept that? ”
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo props, ” says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
As eating habits change, people are getting fatter, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
According to the US Department of Health, between the early 1970 ’ s, when Bo747 defined modern long-haul travel, and at the end of the century, the average male American ’ s weight increased by 10% between 40 and 49 years.
According to US health statistics, the waist circumference of the average male American in the twenty-first century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that its rival adheres to a 1950s seating concept, when the average body of the freshly baptized Jet Set was narrower.
Research has been carried out, according to Airbus, showing that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53%.
Boeing denies Airbus ’ figures on seat dimensions and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines strike the balance between air fares and the institution.
The company also explains that, according to research, the experience on the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
“ It really amounts to giving flexibility to airlines to do what they believe they need to be successful, ” explains Boeing ’ s cabin expert KCraver.
They do not want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that can have an impact on turnover.
Behind the dispute is an estimated $700 billion race for aircraft orders after list prices in the coming decades, which could have a major impact on the US or European export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the layout of seats is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest long-range twin-engine designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
Some of Boeing ’ s statements on the results depend on comparing the 777X, with its ten seats per row, with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than those of machines currently in use with ten seats per series.
“ Boeing is therefore crushing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products, ” says Kevin Keniston, passenger comfort manager at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row on an existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for a narrower arrangement, which could entail cheaper fares.
“ Eighteen inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view, Airbus ’ offer is driven by the threat posed by the 777, ” says Mary Kirby, cabin layout expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world ’ s travelling jet sellers even carry bandwidth with them to measure the equipment in the competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer highly condensed jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a ten-seater A350, but says it has not yet sold one.
Until recently, Airbus underlined the importance of improving cabin adaptability and offering wide aisle seats for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that calls for a new industry standard are likely to disappear, but may distract attention from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could kill off the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the smoking pleasure.
A single dose of vaccine protected mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
More tests are needed before human tests, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good.
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying out all the methods available on the market, but have seen that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches, ” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information needed for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt down the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice who were given nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
By contrast, mice without vaccination would have taken “ time out, ” researchers declared, a sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because of antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often in order to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if safe, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“ They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel any pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, which helps them abandon their habit, ” he explains.
British scientists have said that the results are interesting, but at the same time they have warned that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid
The former Minister of the Laboratory Party, Joe Tripodi of New South Wales, is being subject to an investigation by the State Corruption Authority.
The former NSW minister denies that he changed the maritime lease regime at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who had hidden holdings in three land in state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) broadened investigations into whether Obeid influenced various state ministers to renew lease contracts at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids ran two restaurants and a cafe, without tender after they expiry in August 2005.
The charge that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in land is now being investigated after Tripodi's former Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole testified accordingly on Thursday.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had pressed for public tenders for lease contracts.
The tenants were opposed to this and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the lease contracts for Circular Quay companies, which contributed $2.5 million annually to Obeids, were renewed without public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Port from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally in favour of public tenders.
But he denied making the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reform of the government ’ s lease arrangements.
A telephone letter submitted to the ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Ministry of Port after working under Obeid in the fisheries authority.
‘ Was the issue raised in these telephone calls the drafting of commercial lease rules? ’ asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“ No, ” Tripodi replied.
I cannot remember what was discussed, but definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes attack Syria, according to official Sources
Israeli fighter planes would have attacked targets in Syria ’ s Latakia on Thursday night, as one senior official confirmed to Fox News.
The civil servant did not explain what the objective was, but said that it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies to Syria.
Foreign workers with 45.00 visas could be subjected to “ authenticity tests. ”
The government is considering an “ Echtheit Test ” for 47-visa foreign workers as part of expanded measures.
If the test were to be introduced, it would be used on the basis of a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for move family and friends to Australia.
A proposal for government discussion was published today, after Maxine McKew, former lab Party MP, condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as insult by Australia ’ s neighbors.
“ Loud statements like “ foreigners should stand back, ” and “ Australians hire first ” are a very unpleasant relapse in times when unions were demanding a protected labor market, ” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this has meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region echoed this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for a discussion outlines twelve measures once devised by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who visited Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human smuggling, implemented five of the recommended amendments, while the others are still under consideration.
If the ‘ criterion of authenticity ’ is adopted, someone applying for a visa could be checked to ascertain that ‘ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to or personally linked to the holder or relevant person of the supporting company ’.
Firms could also be obliged to account for the number of 45.00 visa holders after, in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have ended up hiring hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after he arrived on Christmas Island this week on a refugee boat.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father died on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to establish high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England right from the start of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project ‘ will bring Britain closer together ’.
The Scottish Secretary of State for Transport, Keith Brown, has said that he is very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 is a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and the north of England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for the north of England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a final travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: ‘ Our objective for HS2 is a truly national route network bringing Britain and its cities closer together ’.
We are moving forward with HS2 because there are enormous benefits to it.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to the HS2.
As Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented, “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland. ”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to make a ‘ clear ” commitment to Scottish inclusion in the HS2 network.
Brown said, “ The high-speed rail link has enormous potential for economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic power provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK. ”
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgo-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British ministers next year and taking the next steps together.
Electronic equipment regulations will remain in force for the time being in Australia.
Australian passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax such equipment regulations.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their policy so that passengers can read, watch, or play e-books on their equipment during critical flight phases, provided that they are in “ flight mode. ”
Passengers are already allowed to do so during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books at take-off and landing.
Australian airlines are monitoring the decision that US airlines need an enormous amount of work to implement, but they have no immediate plans to change their rules.
The Air traffic Control Authority (CASA) also stated that the announcement would be looked at, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment during critical flight phases still apply in Australia.
‘ CASA does not currently have any specific rules regarding the use of electronic equipment in aircraft ’ has been announced.
The subject is subject to rules requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held discussions with CASA about extending the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, saying that they are open to change, but these must be initiated by the legislature.
“ We would welcome a CASA review of the approval of electronic devices, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience now that we offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight, ” one speaker said.
Qantas has said that it will stick to the current rules for the time being.
“ Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic equipment may not be used on take-off and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that, ” explained the company.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and I am sure we will look carefully at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision varies for US companies according to the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate the radio interference caused by mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programmes and customer training.
“ After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any levels, ” FAA announced.
In rare cases in poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment should be stored safely at take-off and landing beneath the seat or in the compartments above the seats.
In front of the vierderderversus Schalke, BVB trailers with light missiles had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic that offered itself to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests and their songs were heard.
By contrast, the Southern Tribune, where the most faithful of the most faithful - and loudest - BVB fans are, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: no singing, no battccalls.
The pedestal of Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common steering, remained unoccupied.
And at the front of the gallery there was a big flag labelled' Section Prohibition of stadium'.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller was the first BVB player to enter the course, as always, briefly rejoicing.
When his team colleagues followed, there were loud vocals and fierce scarves - but by no means everywhere.
Nothing raged in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the grandstand.
The fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause a a mood either.
Only five minutes before the kick-off did the Capo climb his pedestal - and until then almost tangible tension unleashed in a loud cry when Dickel asked up the mood on the slopes in the stadium as usual.
Finally, as always, it was the turn of the Southern Grandstand - and finally, as usual, it was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call " Dererbysieger is up " came with a start from the southern grandstand, everything was again as usual.
The silence that preceded was probably a response to the events of recent days.
Just before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters had fired beles into the spectators and onto the square - almost meeting goalkekeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was launched belatedly because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the leaders of the Ultras in Dortmund in his office - and if you think Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement, " announced the BVB boss on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the ultras from a choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.
'I banned,' he said.
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy with regard to pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras have been shown various ways of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the Federal Constitutional Court will establish a sanction by the end of next week.
" This will be sweeping, " Watzke asserted.
We is curious to see what the reactions in the southern gallery will then be.
Pfandhouses are booming in Singapore because the crisis has arrived in the middle class.
In a deposit house in the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga swaps a golden bracelet, a ring, and a pair of earrings to pay her daughters ’ school fees.
“ My husband and I have just bought a house, that ’ s where all my money is in, ” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earned 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (about 1,1,730 euros) as administrators and her husband works, monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
Indeed, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it exchanged, became the third deposit house listed on the Singaporean Stock Exchange this week.
Gdging jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, deposit houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% required by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
Deposit houses, however, have the advantage that there is no need to check creditworthiness or proof of income, which is why loans are possible more quickly than in the case of banks.
As a result, millions of people in the region turn to deposit houses, as families feel the pressure of rising the cost of living and an increase in household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit, owing to loose fiscal policies in developed economies, families with lower- and middle-income seek deposit houses to make up the difference as the economy falters.
This week, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly through rising mortgages, described it as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
The Agency estimates that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list, at 80% of GDP, with an increase of 60% as recently as 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which narrowly emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“ Ultimately, this means that, as costs rise, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their incomes wherever possible, ” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have exacerbated the trend to pledge personal items, as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash.
In Singapore, about 70% of the pledged objects in the 200 deposit houses in the city are gold.
People say, “ The price of gold looks good, let us mortgage grandmother ’ s gold chain, and bring it back next month. ”
EasyMoney, the largest Thai Pfandhouse operator, has seen a 20% increase in customers in recent months in its branches.
Growth in deposit is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this at 60% of the $66 million Singapore dollars it earned this week with the Singapore IPO.
While some lenders had caught in the crossfire of high interest rates, Yeah says that deposit houses would not only offer more favorable interest rates than other lenders, but would not directly increase debt debt.
“ Customers borent items they already own, and liquefying personal valuables does not increase household debt, ” she explains.
The mortgage lending business is increasingly accepted by society as short-term, secured financing.
Nor are not all people who use bonds in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to mortgage gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60% of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all social backgrounds come to us.
“ These include wealthy who borrow for a business or investment in the short run, or small businesses who have to bridge cash flow bottlenecks, ” says Yeah.
Sometimes they need money very quickly.
NSA extracts data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help.
The secret service revelator Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to shed light on the increasingly explosive NSA late cases.
According to presentation of Hans-Christian Ströbele, member of the Green Parliament, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence official would testify at a German public prosecutor's office or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden has drawn attention to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to the ARD magazine " Panorama ".
Australian $325 million Bailout of Tasmanian Health
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions associated with the US $325 million Australian bailout package for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging island population, a higher rate of chronic illnesses, and systemic restrictions.
Funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanan MEP Andrew Wilkie.
“ The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state, ” Plibersek explained today.
The $385 million package includes $31 million in emergency aid for electoral services.
A further 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and cataract treatments, are intended to eliminate residues.
There is also money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after in-patient visits, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of a system for electronically recording health data in local hospitals.
“ These investments are in line with the ideas that clinicians have told me were the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system, ” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on the strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian Government.
The state must maintain current levels of financing in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the extra money was spent.
A tripartite commission will be set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if “ it were accompanied by real reforms that put the Tasmanian public health-care system on a more sustainable course. ”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, first made to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state public health system from the care list, ” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these electoral benefits will largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But the federal health spokesman for the opposition, Peter Dutton, believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ cobblestone solution. ”
“ We are in today ’ s situation because the Laboratory Government has withdrawn $430 million from the health-care system, ” he told ABC TV.
It is not acceptable for a government to take almost half a billion dollars out of the system and put EUR 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretend that this is good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on extra bureaucracy.

The solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a tormented shirt for the audience as well.
According to one monitoring group, Syria's ability to produce chemical weapons
Syria had destroyed important facilities for producing chemical weapons and gas munitions, declared the Global Monitoring Group on Chemical Weapons on Thursday, while there were serious clashes in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances are alleged to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began almost three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came the day before the date
1 November, which the Damascus organisation, based in The Hague, had set up to destroy or ‘ inoperable ’ all the facilities for producing chemical weapons, including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition.
Completing this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin to destroy existing weapons and supplies.
It is suspected that there are about 1 000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting was taking place in the city of Safira on Thursday when experts say that there is a chemical weapons production facility and deposits, as the British Syrian Human Rights Observatory announced.
The activist group, which is persecuting the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
29,954 of them were part of President Bashar Assad ’ s army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict at 100,000 since March 2011.
This figure has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee from the country.
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels for weeks in Safira in Safira, many of whom have links with al-Qaeda groups.
The Centre said that there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but that it did not specify any details.
The fighting underscores the danger to chemical-weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, “ the team is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of all the major production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria. ”
Therefore, ‘ no further inspection activities are currently planned ’.
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said that they had completed the first round of reviews and had visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
The inspectors said it was not possible to visit two facilities because of safety concerns.
On Thursday, OPWC declared that the two sites, according to the Syrian statement, had been abandoned … and that the objects of the chemical weapons program there had been transferred to other facilities that had been inspected. ”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“ I salute the bravery and courage that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization, ” said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organization, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad ’ s government and its security forces, to which many members of the Alawites belong, a secession of Shia Islam.
With regard to further developments, Rami Abdurrahman, head of the observation group, said that there had been a major explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal Latakia Latakia.
The cause of the explosion unknown, he explained.
Anger at Judgment for Bali Bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angry at the verdict on the last of the instigators to be brought to justice, believing that Umar Patek should be shot under by law.
Patek, who was one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia for just under ten years, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
With suspension he could be dismissed after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A verdict was also made in a number of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosives on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The public prosecutor ’ s office had demanded a life sentence, even if she could have requested the death penalty for the man also known as ‘ Demolition Man ’ for his reputation as a master bomber.
The decision has aroused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin brothers Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his fellow conspirators nearly a decade ago.
Fighting with tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow the other guys in the footsteps.
“ He should be placed in front of a firing squad, ” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with not having any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when, on 12 October 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a massive bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded an explosive backpack.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times while hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserves the same fate as the other three members of Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas, and Imam Samudra – who caused the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy should be given the death penalty before anyone else.
Keep him alive no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers on trial.
He escaped almost a decade of arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda Chairman Osama bin Laden barely four months later.
During the negotiations, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“ He didn ’ t stand, ” Corteen said.
Until recently, he showed no regret for how much suffering he inflicted on other people.
The verdict was passed before the ten-year anniversary of this year's commemoration ceremony in Bali and Australia.
“ There will be many tears this year, ” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on aeroplanes (but not make mobile phone calls)
Travengers can now listen to their electronic devices to read, work, play, music and watch movies from departure to landing, but not use mobile phones, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes implemented immediately.
At a press conference, FAA staff member Michael Huerta explained how quickly they were implemented depended on the airline airline.
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of air crew and the rules on the storage of equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the enhanced use of electronic devices very soon, ” the FAA announced.
At present, passengers have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You will not be allowed to take off again until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain has given the green light.
When entering the landing, passengers must switch them off again and not take them back before the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the equipment on take-off, landing and on the roller field, the FAA explained.
Most of the new aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
“ If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – it will benefit both sides, ” Glading commented.
Quite honestly, we are tired of having to feel watchdogs on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages, or downloading data of less than three kilometers remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to fly to smartphones, tablets and other devices.
So still not “ Words With Friends, ” the Scrabble like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the boarding gate.
And heavier equipment, such as laptops, must continue to be stored, because there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, on CBS News, said that mobile phones are still regarded as a risk.
“ Mobile phones really are a problem, not only because they could potentially disrupt navigation devices, but also because we at the FCC know that aerial transmission can also disrupt transmitters, ” Rosenker says.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine this issue recommended last month that the government allow ise wider use of personal electronic equipment.
In recent years, pressure has increased on FAA to ease restrictions on use.
Critics like Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill argue that there are no valid safety reasons for the ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of equipment has become ubiquitous.
Some studies say that up to one third of passengers forget about or ignore the shutdown.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966, as reports of disruption to navigation and communications equipment by passenger FM radios became known, which were the latest technological trends at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA in such a way that they do not mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been providing Wi-Fi to passengers for several years when the height of the flight is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interferences.
Mr Huerta said, the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new guidelines.
Today ’ s electronic devices generally emit far less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation if you flip over.
But when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Advocates of loosening restrictions on passenger use of equipment include Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-readers and took a test flight to identify problems, but were unable to identify any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the disruption caused by the equipment was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee have said that there are only a few reports from pilots in favour of disbing aircraft systems, most of which are very old.
However, the committee recommended to the FAA that pilots should be allowed to order equipment switched off by passengers when landing instruments in poor visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the amendments and described them as a sensible adaptation for travellers, who would now be fully equipped with technology.
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety, ” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Birds rescued by air rescue from North Sea drilling island
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into nature.
The water rp was flown last month by helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was dumped by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said, “ This waterfall was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe stopped by strong winds over the North Sea. ”
It seems that the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added, “ He could not continue flying, so we were contacted with a request for help. ”
When they were released, the waterfall was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy around the table and defining what those in Britain who provide wealth and work want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders asking what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives representing roughly the UK ’ s sizes, sectors, and regions.
The survey results will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, concentrating on countries that modernise and grow, while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to favour new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than the long and demanding process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
questioned, in their view, on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, because, according to companies, the costs of Brussels ’ rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40% of the large companies that are traditionally the most pro-European agreed.
Finally, and this is probably the most important, our questioning of economic leaders found that a clear majority of Britain wants to take a course towards changing the agreement and a tradable relationship with the EU, not politics.
This insight, found among companies of all sizes and leaders, shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings governance back to the UK.
The stakes are very high – changing the agreement and improving conditions for the UK would lead to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum at 16%.
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate Britain ’ s conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible, and increasingly necessary, as the eurozone moves toward a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey show, which means greater attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes the pipeline in Bulgaria as the start of a new gas era.
Construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects, according to the Gazprom Board of Management.
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun, ” said Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the whole of the European continent.
South Stream is intended to bring more diversity to Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russian gas for Europe is stored, increases risk on conventional routes, as officials say.
Miller said that the direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated ‘ forever ’.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the whole project is up and running in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries is due to commence on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline has an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way around Germany as a real estate location.
The economic fundamentals are correct, and the possibilities for financing are excellent.
This was the thrust of the 9th Real Estate Day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Jones Lang LaSalle's Europe, Middle East and Africa, pointed this out on the 9th Real Estate Day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
According to Ulbrich, a glance at the volume of transactions shows how German commercial real estate is looking for.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the same period last year.
Plus was only 6% in the UK and 19% in France.
" Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate, " said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is historically high.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: two YMCA staff accused of accusations against Jonathan Lord of sexual offences.
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual crimes involving children before charges were brought against Caringbah ’ s carer Jonathan Lord in 2011, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
However, when the opening statement was made to the Commission, the YMCA stated that ‘ it never had to deal with an incident of child sexual abuse in the organisation ’.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was consulted about a case in which one YMCA employee had been charged of child pornography and another in which a YMCA CA ingbah Hall sports teacher had been convicted of abusing children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA ’ s opening declaration vis-à-vis the Commission was also imprecise in claiming that “ there had been external reviews by the YMCA that recognized the YMCA as at the forefront of child security. ”
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the age of 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management had failed “ from me to down ” to recruit Lord, and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report breaches of child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted earlier this year of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years of work for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
But Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord ’ s violations of children ’ s safety.
The staff said that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, looked after them as a babysitter, let them sit on his lap, said that he loved it and let children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the head of child, Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior of the YMCA Caringbah, was “ very intimidating and very remote for most of the time. ”
The CEO said he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report their superior.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had impaired their judgement, which is why they would not have reported to him.
Hare explained that he had informed the Board of Directors of the YMCA NSW of his view that the lesson that the organization should learn from the “ Jonathan Lord incident ” “ did not concern employee reporting, ” and the Board had agreed with him.
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations was taken by Liam Whitley, Managing Director of the YMCA's Children's Services.
He said that this was intended to prevent contamination of the evidence, which had been ‘ overzealous ’ and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a children-safe organization while Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, to the commission.
He explained that there had been “ serious problems ” with the recruitment, verification, familiarisation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was deferred until 20 December.
Tony Blair said that he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of leaving office, the 59-year-old expressed his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as Head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British policy, mostly limiting his comments to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Quartet of peacemakers in the Middle East.
When asked whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, the Evening Standard in London quoted Blair as saying, “ Yes, certainly, but that is unlikely to happen, in other words... ”
When the horse-drawn rubber experts gathered in droves in Cardiff to choose the horse of the year, they knew that fierce competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The knee, who is not even in the kindergarten and took his first steps only a few months ago, and his Shetland Pony Toffee loosely trked through the three laps and won first prize – leaving 30 adult adversaries behind.
The inseparable couple, both of equal size, have been praised for their performance, behaviour and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had put on his plate hat in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old coffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony well above his age.
Toffee received top marks for his performance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a present for his third birthday last March and since then had practiced every day with the Shetland Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “ Fenton and Toffee are a great band. ”
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and left the field with gold trophy and rosette.
It was only the second time he had taken part in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells told us, “ The entire audience was like electrified, and everyone fired and applauded him. ”
He ran the length of the arena on sand and although he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
As it started, it won ’ t be long before it is on the “ Horse of the Year ” show – and I am sure it will do well.
As one annual horse show spokesman said, “ Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony. ”
Together, they are a great team.
The jurors judged Fenton and Coffee according to how well they would have presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They ensure good cooperation between pony and guide – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fentino ’ s sweet clothing has done its part to make this really perfect for the occasion.
The Chinese Newspaper Calls for Reform
A Chinese newspaper calling on the front page for the release of a reporter accused of defamation to be reformed, said a press regulator.
The Guangzhou based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a state-owned firm.
Now the New Express is being subjected to a “ comprehensive certification, ” the regulator declared.
The “ Rectification Order ” came from the Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion.
“ The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly, ” announced in a statement by the regulatory statement.
She said that she had decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter licence. ”
They also “ instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a full reconstruction of the Neue Express, recommending identifying the relevant officials at the Neue Express and immediately review the Neue Express management team. ”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
Having been arrested, the newspaper published two front-page calls for his release and backed his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television, mitting that he had published false reports in exchange for payment.
“ In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence, ” he explained to the CCTV.
I did so primarily because I was eager for money and glory.
It has become clear to me that I did the wrong thing.
Following Chen ’ s apology, the New Express issued an apology on the front page, declaring that it had failed to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law earlier this year in which the authorities were banned from forcing someone to accuse themselves.
Discovers US-Mexico Mexico Drug Tunnels
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical rail operations, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the tunnel measuring 120 x 90 centimetres as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-loaded lorries.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unnoticed by the authorities.
According to the Court's records, eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms cocaine were secured during the discovery of the tunnel.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of owning and ending to sell marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences of between ten years and life if they are convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing the challenge to the drug cartels of how they can quickly get their product to the consumer.
In 2010, the authorities found a 640 metre long track passage that ran from a kitchen in a residence in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love.
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr are still loving themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom spoke about separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, which was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said that' life is sometimes exactly what we plan or hope'.
Kerr and he still loved themselves, the 36-year-old emphasized.
'We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn'.
Kerr and Bloom are married since 2010 and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to encyclopaedia, veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism, but it is very different from vegetarianism.
While vegetarians take the liberty of eating cream cake, ice cream or strong Edam, these delicacies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the abandonment of meat and fish, the vegan discourages all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one might wonder, but on closer examination, the vegan world of nutrition is highly imaginative.
" Bread spreads are very popular, " explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local Reformhaus, who offers a wide range of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also enjoys visiting the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native of New Zealand Zealand has been living vegan, in Lampertheim he has find (almost) everything he needs to live in.
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
" Conviction came not only because of the diet, but also because of the choice of shoes, " says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realised that no animal products are possible in other everyday matters.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethics.
" I don't want animals to die for me, " Proctor says the vegans' maxim, which extends to all consumer patterns.
Instead of mourning burgers, stirring and agitating eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products and enthusiasm increased.
" It's a double bonus, " says Proctor today, " in fact, vegan is not a renunciation, it's not an asceticism, but an enrichment ".
And it was precisely these conditions, no matter how well-intentioned attempts, failed.
" The addictive factor is a very important factor, which allows many to give up quickly, much to smoking, " Proctor makes a comparison.
And argue:' Certain tastes cannot be tied to animals'.
It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
" You can also create the same effect in other ways, " the vegan points out.
Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and some vegan sausages to a barbecue.
It ensures a balanced and varied diet, which is supposed to taste hearty.
Of course we want something between teeth, that is legitimate.
" It should taste, but it cannot be reduced to animal food, " Proctor said.
He had not suffered any damage to health up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I do not absorb foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
High-performance athletes who only eat vegan.
" My blood values are excellent, I check, " Proctor says.
In particular, many vegan critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
" Since animals are fed with feedingstuffs instead of grazing pasture, it is doubtful whether the proportion of vitamin B12 in the meat purchased in the chest of cold is high, " Proctor says.
There is also the possibility of vegans taking the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
" My B12 values are fine, " he explains.
Proctor for food supply need not go a long way.
After all, staple foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
Everything I need is to be found on the ground.
Only from time to time I buy something special.
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but that is how it is with " ordinary " finished products ".
In any case, the preparation of dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly assumed.
" There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with just a few small tricks you can achieve good, if not in part better, results, " Proctor says.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cake Proctor was also able to amaze his father-in-law.
The vegan adds a new spice to family celebrations.
This has dynamism; if you cook together, it has a new meaning.
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves, " Proctor says.
Of course, he has already been skeptical.
Do you not like my food any more?
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk? " - with such questions you have to act as a vegan with sensitivity.
'I do not reject people, I am part of that society,' Proctor does not want to be an enclave.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Also fast food.
You can find chips everywhere!
" Many döner shops offer falafel, or even a vegetarian yufka, " says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he switches to pasta dishes, or order a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
Restaurants are slowly adapting to this.
'When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, it was much more difficult,' the New Zealander can find a development:' You have to talk to people, make them aware of it'.
" If there are enough inquiries, they may be inclined to supplement the menu, " he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the compartment in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on their menu.
There are basically vegan dishes for everyone.
Everybody can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive food.
" Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense, because they exclude others, " Proctor notes.
" If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible in the first place, " Proctor says.
However, purchasing vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Particularly when you learn to understand that even peanuts can contain contain animal additives as a dder, you seem to be quickly leaving your courage by following ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: " Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients added in food and cleaning products.
" Gradually you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos to pay attention to " It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble, " Proctor knows.
Veganism is an important moral finger that beats consciousness.
He may not quite manage to abandon his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question their habits critically.
The exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers on track.
Trading at Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication the operator blamed technical problems.
The other 11 US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The most recent incident continues a series of smaller and large breakdowns at the exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the indexes of the Nasdaq had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two mishaps in a week's time alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massive faulty purchase orders to the option markets because of technical problems.
It then took exchange operators almost a whole day to look through and cancel orders.
Two days later, half of all US stock trading came to a standstill for several hours because of a computer breakdown at the Nasdaq Exchange.
Facebook ’ s IPO also caused a stir last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not been up to the flood of purchase and sales orders, later found the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and dilned the company to a record $10 million.
Konstanz: Cyclists are 63 years old
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man travelled illegally with a women's bicycle on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., on the left sidewalk from the station square to the market place.
According to the police, when a 663 year-old man suddenly walked away from a restaurant, the cyclist could not put the brakes in time.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall, later went to the ground and pulled a space wound about 15 centimetres on his head.
A rescue team took the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
Assange ’ s Extradition of British Police
Today, the British police handed over an extradition ruling to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sought refuge and applied for asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard declared that the 40-year-old Australian had been given an “ invitation to face up ” urging him to appear in a police station, and added that if he failed to comply, he was threatened with arrest.
Assange threatens to be extradited to Sweden on charges of committin a sexual offence, after having exhausted his possibilities under British law, since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “ sent a call to a 40-year-old man to join a police station at any time we chose, ” one spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions under which he was released on bail.
The message made no comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, accused on charges of espionage after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks revelation website.
Drivers who have been straight between their legs with 210 km / h and a hot drink will be fined £1,000.
A penalty of £1,000 was imposed on a driver for driving up to 210 km / h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the beverage cup between his legs.
Before the Colchester District Court, Howie declared himself guilty without having taken the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie has also been convicted of paying £90 and a victim supplement of £100.
Tax on Foreign Real Owners versus London ’ s Bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but it is still awaiting the final decision taken by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who imposed a 7% stamp tax on housing in the 2012 budget costing more than £2 million, and annual fees for buyers who own housing as a company, not as individuals.
Already, housing stamp tax revenues in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which were £708 million in the 2012-13 tax year, exceed the revenues collected for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, North-West, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said, “ After the stamp tax increases on high-price housing and the introduction of related legislation against evasion, it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is too low a tax, regardless of the impact of the outdated local tax system. ”
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more reticent about buying or discouraging owners from selling real estate in London, ” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five-10 per cent of the housing market by price – in London ’ s wealthy south-west belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has made a record 11.8% more expensive last year.
According to Savills, prices in Central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market ” in which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%), and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the connection between a dog ’ s tail eding and its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs waving the tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at Trento University, said, “ Man is well aware that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimulus that arouses positive or negative emotions. ”
Here we have tried to look at this in the case of other species.
He also noticed that in dogs as well as in humans, the right half of the brain was responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral swings of their species, the researchers supervised the animals while watched the films of other dogs.
They measured the four-legged heart rate and analyzed the behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction.
Professor Vallortigara said, “ We have shown dogs films with dogs – either a faithful version to nature or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we have been able to control the tail movement more left or right. ”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right (from the point of view of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tendency was mainly left (again from the perspective of the wwing dog), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
He is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience which movements they should and should not be concerned about.
He said, “ If you have different encounters with other dogs, and swallowing with the tail in one direction is more linked to friendly behavior, and the right produces rather less friendly behavior, you will react on the basis of those experiences. ”
Researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, vets, and trainers to gain a better understanding of their animal ’ s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behaviour and hospitality at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicetrics at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine whether the left and the right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it is a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria in Canada said: “ Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when his “ tail ” wings left, not right, rather than restled – the other way around than the Italian study. ”
According to him, the differences could stem from the fact that the dogs did not interpret the animals as dogs in the films or robot dogs in the various studies.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception, ” Bradshaw said.
Since their behaviour is easy to record, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.

Pope Francis appoints First Cardinals in February
On February 22, Pope Francis will be convening new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are the ones who elect a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately be involved in choosing his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal aged 80 can no longer take part in the Pope ’ s election – that belongs to a group of 120 “ electoral cardinals. ”
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all the cardinals would take place before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as consistency, was held.
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene consistency in February so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned, ” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of electoral cardinals probably fell by February.
He declared that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary to restore the number of cardinals eligible to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he likes.
Consistence next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, according to Valero.
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe, and Italy in particular.
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance, ” he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny cardinals.
Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Cardinal Council established by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with finding ways of reforming the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him, ” Valero said.
He said that it was “ all very well ” for Francis to ask for advice from the cardinals.
So far, however, we have not been able to do so – all of this is entirely new.
Valero said that bishops from large places are typically called cardinals, but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we don ’ t know who he appoints. ”
GM recalls new US pick-up trucks to repair the seat backrest.
General Motors recalls nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pick-up trucks, built in 2014, to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat rest, according to the US vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
That is why they do not comply with the federal vehicle safety guidelines for head restraints.
“ When driving from behind to the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, so there is an increased risk of injury, ” read the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1st and September 10th.
Delivery of the GM-Trubegan in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since insolvency induced restructuring in 2009.
GM informed owners of the defect in the first half of October.
Due to the 16-day government shutdown, NHTSA could not check the notification letter, which adversely affected car purchases in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks redeveloped for the 2014 model year increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4% to US $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
An Obama voter ’ s Cry of Despair
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope of change.
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts thwarted by the Republican blockade tactics.
The policy of blockade does not excuse Obamacare ’ s website problems, the drone strikes.
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what could.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I am reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I thought would brighr me up during the gloomy second year of my medical studies and give me renewed hope.
It is called The Audacity to Win, ” describes Barack Obama ’ s memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient letters in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and was able to take a breath away.
The election became a landslide victory and news speakers stopped to demonstrate the historic significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
Back then, when Obama took office in 2008, he had 82% approval ratings.
Then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a nasty awakening, like being taken out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Something has changed in the years since I first voted.
But it is simply not something I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from passing the Affordable Care Act on Health Insurance to military withdrawal from Iraq, ending the forced forced concealment of homosexuality, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I agree that the party-political obstructionist tactics have overturned too many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But, having defended the Obama administration against acquaintances countless times, my attempts to explain have come to an end.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade cannot explain why allowing the eavesdropping of foreign leaders or the overseas killing of innocent children by drones.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans, and why whistleblowers who expose government wrongdoing are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public financing and spending limits are bypassed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House ’ s efforts to silence the media are “ “ most aggressive … since the Nixon government. ”
Finally, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know that is what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood, at the age of 18, that the work of government could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it?
Obviously, the Office of Deputies is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate.
But when I look at the examples given above, they seem to have been largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative; he did not seem to be able to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard about for so long.
But, as Obama ’ s approval ratings fall to less than 45% this week, this book has made the return to 2008 all the tougher.
It awakens my desire for the many promises that have evaporated.
This week, I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to make a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a meeting with the electoral workers following the decision, he told his staff that they must get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
“ I want us to find our magic again, ” he said.
Remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr President, and I could not agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflicts of interest on parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interests in his parental leave plans because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from them.
The mining magnate in ing over the payment of $6 million in carbon taxes made the claim when he wanted to brush aside questions as to whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important in deciding whether or not to cut or cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott ’ s daughters would benefit benefit from the law.
“ He is in a major conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she receives holidays or not, ” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of Fairfax ’ s Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes ahead of the recount.
Palmer called for a review of the counting process so that it can proceed more quickly.
Tony Abbott ’ s daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“ We need a better system, ” he said.
Why should we not have a system for marading, entering data into a computer, voting immediately and then having the result at 6: 30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils marking ballot papers.
Do you use them because you can then wipe out the results if you do not like them?
Voting with pencils these days is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and has recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, declared that his policies would include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new post “ very seriously ”.
Public office is about public service.
“ We are not striving for any reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve this community at a critical time, ” he said.
RBS Susposes Two Forders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is yet another indication that the global regulatory inquiry into alleged manipulation of the currency market is at a rapid pace.
Some of the world ’ s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities to investigate the world ’ s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes ownership daily.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the Libor Interbank deal scandal entails.
The Bank, which made no comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from the authorities.
“ Our investigations are continuing and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators, ” said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation indicated that RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is said to have been confirmed by his current position as European Head of Forex Spot Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was left this week, and Matt Gardiner, formerly senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traffickers has been accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma declared that it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign-exchange market by a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are considering allegations that bankers kers have agreed on currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb through instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of wrongdoing.
The news of these investigations has roiled traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable profitable investment bank trading units in recent years, but which has been under pressure this year because low currency volatility limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downdown the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign-exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that, despite the enormous daily volume of foreign-exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms means that “ you can influence the market even with very low ticket prices. ”
The news came out the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had dismissed a trader in its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week, having caused a loss of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and cooperates with them.
“ We are sure that the trader acted on his own and that the matter is contained, ” said Credit Suisse.
The fence painted on the Bechtle property.
A group of the citizens' initiative " Schweizer Wiese " has beautified the fence on the Bechtle Land on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
It also cleaned up and widened the footpath, says one press release.
The planned cover of the crumbling house at the back of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, as the site is in danger of slipping.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to beautify his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Prior to the BI's action, there was a banner with the message' We are in favour'.
However, this did not bother the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Their motto on the poster was " We are against ruins ".
In doing so, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the gigantic project one day fail.
In talking with many passers-by in front of the " construction site ", it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city project would be better off for many, although quite a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI.
But they are beginning to give up because the city delays these answers, the BI says.
As we have heard, the mayor's public pronouncements also have an impact.
May said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the end of the thermal baths should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the citizen's decision.
Some therefore seem almost frightened, while others see it as a " crude attempt at blackmail " against the population, according to the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers.
Rangnick Ment for Schiris: Man no Swallow King
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the " Bulls " was disappointed by the referees.
" There is currently a dangerous tendency to push Mane and Alan into the category of swallow kings, " he protected the two offenders at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest reason for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3: 0 versus Val Gardena last Sunday, when the Senegalese were fatalized by an alleged performance - but it was not one, as the TV pictures showed.
" A blatant wrong decision, " Rangnick, who called referee Harkam " completely overstretched. "
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Gardena coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He strongly defended his German compatriot:' I would have behaved in the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation'.
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I know why.
" I am the one who was insulted, " the 46 year-old stressed.
In view of the track record, however, Rangnick made an anthem of praise.
" There are only two words: really good, " he said.
There is not much wrong.
The way the team plays is particularly impressive.
This should continue calmly.
There will hardly be any changes in winter transfer.
There are no great reasons to make a difference.
" Except a player comes to play with the desire to leave the club, " Rangnick made clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five votes to four, judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to take out health insurance or pay fines by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy ruled against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining parts of the 2700-page law, and also argued that the health-care law ’ s requirement that states should either extend the conditions for access to Medicaid or otherwise eliminate all state Medicaid subsidies was not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit against the law had been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been decisively rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidate, including the eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place with huge mirrors light
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their gloomy valley.
Due to the low level of sunlight, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord Valley usually sinks into the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors 45 metres high, a century's dream came true on Wednesday.
" Finally! ", mayor Steinar Bergsland blackened at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some people in the valley made their way around sun loungers, others set up sunglasses for safety reasons.
Until now, sun-hungry people have had to take a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen proposed to steer the rays into the valley.
This basic idea has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council had finally adopted the project costing SEK 5 million (around EUR 615 000).
A similar construction has been giving the Italian Alpine resort of Viganella winter sunshine for several years.
Post Hardly Empty on Sundays
" Many citizens will not have noticed yet, the red dots for the Sunday sleeve are still located at various post boxes in the hearof city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptying is no longer taking place on Sundays and holidays, " says the FDP.
A request from the German Free Democratic Party has confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, people will only be emptied in front of the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether Sunday is emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten is not answered in the answer to the FDP ’ s question.
The spokesman for the German Free Democratic Party (DP) on social and youth policy, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to insist on this.
Sundays are an important postal service, especially for appointments.
'Despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013, this undertaking is radically and unreasonable for them'.
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Liberal Group and Urban Association, supports his group colleagues:' What annoys me is the fact that the vacancy times are being surreptiously changed or even deleted'.
The post office is miles away from being close to the citizens.
" At least the post boxes in the districts Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays, " says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
The heart of the city also applies that especially non-mobile fellow citizens should be able to reach a mailbox with Sundays on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked the city parliament if the city administration is planning to discuss this matter by post.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
To his knowledge, however, there is also a Sunday in Hofheim.
Your party has pronounced itself in favour of privatisation.
" Then decisions elsewhere, " Maier said.
Frankfurt ’ s parking fees are to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt may soon be expensive.
The magistrate of the city is discussing this morning a presentation by traffic voter Stefan Majer (Greens).
This means that parking charges are to be increased by 50%.
However, this is not to increase prices, but to reduce the time interval between parking clocks and vending machines from 30 minutes to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Council will have to decide.
The retail committee of the Chamber of Commerce Frankfurt considers this " is not a good idea ".
The hotel was very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful.
The German transport club is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is' entirely appropriate and in fact long overdue'.
Public transport is also more expensive.
City of Joy: Fast promotions Hosts
Lords I of TSV Freudenstadt had to fight TG Schönningen from the Swabian Alb with a narrow cadre in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen.
The elders were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
It soon became apparent, however, that they could not fully keep up with the rapid actions of the joyful cities, even as a result of old age.
The Gönninger found it extremely difficult to cope with the tough and placed strokes.
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz played neatly over the middle of the network and were not there to prevent block it.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of joy in all respects.
In view of this overwhelming and playful performance, the third set was won somewhat lax and sluggish to the 3: 0 score (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).
On 2 November, the TV Baiersbronn, which clearly won in Nagold, will be a much more powerful opponent.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a fiercely contested two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points, especially when accepting the ball; in passports, too, precision was sometimes scarce, and in some critical scenes, the overzeal prevented people from considering possible point gains.
In this powerful very balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto was consistently matched by the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
For the fifth day in the succession to the Natura 2000 project in Upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Based on suggestions from the population, the view of the valley in the area of the hut should be opened on this day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the highlight of the canyon, where the landscape offers the ideal setting for wonderful views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of caring for was an appropriate instrument for strengthening the link between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set the tone in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, the environmental aspect could also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Nature Conservation Department of the regional President of Freiburg following the welcome by Councillor Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action every success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist objective of the foresight coincides with the aim of maintaining the old Allmendweidfeld, which has grown considerably, with its specific types of habitats, by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of woodland.
You need these free conservation links.
Tribukait said that she would not want to stand up here for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure fits in seamlessly with this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous complement to what has been achieved with the Life project as well as the previous days of care for the future.
After these various speeches, area managers Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten beforehand and the forest tractor was ready for use if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of exempting juniper bushes and maintaining a dry stone bar.
The aim was to have a clear view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Köpfler Still Only Candidate
Internet information: Although the small town of Löffingen, with its 7514 inhabitants, intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children's, youth and senior policy, as well as its own urban works, can be considered an attractive city, no second candidate for mayor has yet registered.
The 46-year-old banker and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has so far been the only candidate for the succession of the mayor, Norbert Brugger, who is no longer longer a candidate for reasons of age.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11th at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sues Nortel patents
The Thursday, which owns thousands of previous Nortel-Nortel patents, Thursday Thursday an avalanche of patent for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd., HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies before the Texas District Court for patent infringements.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that reconciles search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the complaint that goes to the heart of Google ’ s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC manufacture mobile that work with Google ’ s Android operating system, which competes sharply with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google placed an initial bid of over $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times, most recently offering $4.4 billion.
After outbid in Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal partly motivated by Motorola ola's library of patents.
“ Although Google has failed to to the lawsuit patents at the auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so, ” says the lawsuit.
According to the charge, Rockstar demands a high level of compensation from Google, because it claims that Google ’ s patent infringement is deliberate.
Egypt ’ s Sworn in First freely elected presidents
Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mean the end of Egypt ’ s political disputes.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt ” when he was sworn in as the country ’ s first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who had been expelled 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world ’ s first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the judgment dressed in black robes, which has its seat on the Nile and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
“ We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic, ” Morsi said at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“ Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy, and stability, ” said 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had mostly been sharply targeted by their respective governments as a banned organization since its inception 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 o ’ clock local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in the court to cheer the new president, and, unlike the Mubarak presidential splendor, traffic was only halted briefly, so that the car convoy could cross the usually busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
derided as the Brotherhood ’ s uncharismatic “ spare wheel, ” his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech, presenting himself not only as an Islamist candidate, but also to all those who wanted to bring the efforts of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak to its end.
“ Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state, ” Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with red ties, explained to judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he sworn in.
Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem he listened to in hed position.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival he was greeted by hundreds of people in the university ’ s largest auditorium with choirs from the army and the people are one hand.
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970 ’ s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the Military Council had taken ited from the ousted head of state.
However, by taking the official oath to court and not, as usual, before Parliament, he is bowing to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi ’ s Tahir Square speech was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberg Disco ensures Two Great Even
The new season in the Falkenberg discotheque " Blue Velvet " has begun.
This Friday evening it will be called " Pump this Party ", tomorrow, Saturday evening, we will continue with a Ü 25 party.
Of course the organizers promise fat beats and cool sounds on both days.
Workers fell from ladder: seriously injured
On Thursday, when a defective external feeling was changed, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to change a defective heating sensor on the exterior facade of an inn.
As he climbed onto the ladder facing the gutter, it slipped away and the man crashed onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg Hospital with the rescue helicopter " Christophorus 6 ".
Twice Life imprisonment in South Africa
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim had died as a result of the consequences of serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty of crime earlier this week.
The act caused horror nationwide.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of young people was so appalling that the carers and sisters needed psychological support.
Kana admitted during the trial that she was in a bar with Booysen on Tatnight.
He also admitted that he beaten and raped her, but denied responsibility for the death of the girl.
The police had initially taken as their starting point for several perpetrators, but released two suspects from prison for insufficient evidence against them.
The Public Prosecutor ’ s Office also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost a daily occurrence in South Africa: there are about 64 000 sexual violence every year.
That is almost ten times more than in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has far more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa, however, estimate the number of unreported cases of sexual violence to be between 10 and 25 times.
Jumbo visits Black Forest Ham
Jumbo in search of the " best ham in the world ": Pro7 star Bonndorf visited the TV show " Galileo ".
The spokesman makes it clear at the outset that the most important thing for the ham is the pig pillars, and turbomast is not a good precondition.
Can the ham you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the working methods of the company " Adler " in Bonndorf.
" Germany's favourite ham ", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest Ham.
Only with hair protection and kittens can it get inside the factory.
Jumbo, too, must disinfect his hands before he is allowed to grasp to the microphone.
Jumbo for the strengthening of fast food in Waldshut
'I am working with a lot of work here', the televised makers, the Black Forest ham as a mass product, are surprised.
16,000 culls per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what matters in terms of quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television at a level?
Details such as the ph-value of the meat also matter.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
" There I'm curious to see when you measure Roberto Blanco what happens then, " says Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching is worthwhile.
The spectator can see that dismantling the culls remains manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found on the shelf without bones.
The secret of ham is spice mixture with salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing are visually reminiscent of a " submarine ".
Trick: Fir branches provide the special taste of the Black Forest ham in the smoke.
20 days in smoke make the ham almost black.
" Now the disk disappears in the Jumbo, " he announces test feeding.
" He's really delicious, " is the conclusion of the TV star.
Everyone involved will be able to live with.
You thought travel agencies a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
The Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its earnings prospects for the year as a whole and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects adjusted annual pre-tax gains of between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to 315 million in its previous forecast.
Achieving the current targets will mean growth of 12-17% compared to a record profit of $290.4 million in 2011-12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, the Flight Centre made eight per cent of its profits in the first half of the year and made a strong start in the second half of the year, particularly in the Australian and British private business.
“ Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are well on the way to record-year revenues before interest and taxes, ” he said.
These include Australia and Great Britain, which are typically among our strongest.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker business travel market.
Things went similarly well for Flight Centre ’ s leisure activities in the UK, while business customers also spent less.
US business recovered compared to the weaker first half of the year, so profits are expected to be made for the full year for the third consecutive year.
Yesterday, the shares of Flight Centre rose by 3 cents to $38.20.
Schools are encouraged to focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar.
In the future, students will have to discuss at least one piece of Shakespeare, a nineteenth-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes “ unread texts ” to encourage you to read more widely.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to take an independent GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as their separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new English and mathematics curricula tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other nuclear compartments will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Supervisory Authority, will announce a reorganization of GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less price work.
In a speech this summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that “ there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence, ” stressing that the GCSEs will become “ more challenging, ambitious, and stricter. ”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours a year, or three hours a week per school year – than most other countries.
By contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to allow more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that comprehensive mathematitesting – combined with greater weighting of the rankalization – is likely to encourage schools to take more hours.
The curriculum places more attention on “ real life problems, ” including financial mathematics.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
The next Ecumenical Forum for Talks on Monday, 21 October at the Neue Museum des Schschloss deals about the topic " Zur Hölle mit Hölle - Theologische Überlegungen zum heutigen mit den letzten Dinge ".
The lecturer is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Forum for Talks is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant church communities of Salem, Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of Bodenseekreis.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate the question in the forum of how people classify the " last things " after death.
If people had known too much about this over the past centuries, relying on the images of heaven and hell that " have shaped our ideas to this day " " contemporary prophetic doctrine of hopes of completion is characterised more by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
" Greater hope has been driven out of Christians by religious critique, " says the speaker.
It has' provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost exclamation marks'.
Johanna Rahner goes on to say:' But the crucial challenge remains the anger of death'.
Related to this is the question of those " dreaming that everything will be good in the end ".
Johanna Rahner, 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She holds a Ph.D. in Dr. theol. in 1997, also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the WestfWilhellische Wilhelms-Universität.
Johanna Rahner holds a chair of systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel since 2010.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Kleinen Heuberg reaffirm their creed during the ceremony.
101 15-year-old and 16-year-old olds of the SeelsorgeUnit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been named in two services.
The service was accompanied by Laudato-Si Group in the morning and The Spirit Youth Choir in the afternoon.
By receiving the firmsacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous members of the municipality, the companies had prepared for the great day of celebration.
In different projects they got to know different tasks of the Christian community life and experienced Youth Day in Untermachtal together.
Illmensee: Second Mountain Bike Race inspires participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the circular course over the hills around the lake.
This is what Ulrich Knobel says from the organising sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially at short distances of more than 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude, were numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the top German class were also present in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach Linz recommended good rankings at the German Championships.
These two departed from the field as expected.
As last year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time lead to the finish line and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was once again placed in second place.
For the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare who made it to the top of the winning staircase.
Anne Adel from Lake Illmen and Leonie Drivers from Owingen came in second and third place.
One gratiing development is the increase in the number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
It was not only in terms of performance that the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten for the youngest to more than 70 for the oldest starters.
In the main race there were even more absolute top athletes this year.
Four riders were able to set themselves apart from the regional top riders.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a semi-professional mountain bike from the Black-Tusk racing team.
Pangerl, together with a team mate, has already been the world champion in 12-hour driving twice.
This year, he became the champion of Europe in this particular discipline.
This also includes Roland Ballerstedt, who already owns two German championship titles in the duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, an eyelashes final took place in the finish line in front of the Drei-Seen-Halle.
Pangerl was the first to rest across the finish line.
Just one second behind that, the routine Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann reached the finish line as third parties in the overall standings.
In the women's rankings Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart won second place.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organised running of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients.
The West African country has not many doctors, only one for 5,000.
Vote here or with your Mobile Device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to make him the “ CNN Hero of the Year. ”
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father repeatedly lose consciousness and traved to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, Cameroon capital.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation occurred that spread to his brain, causing a haematomas there that would impair him for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, ” says Georges Bwelle.
We would have left Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals for the treatment they offered.
“ It ’ s not easy, ” Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and yet you are not the first.
There are a great many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has scarcely changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people each, according to the World Health Organisation.
In the United States, on the other hand, the ratio is that of a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most cameroons could not afford to visit them.
Two in the country ’ s five people live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country ’ s health-care spending is private.
“ The only problem they have is Poverty, ” says Bwelle.
Poverty also makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his compatriots suffer made Bwelle take the decision to do something about it.
Georges Bwelle and his voluntary team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas at weekends and provides free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped just under 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people forced themselves into minibuses and use the snow-covered medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to villages villages that need help.
Not everything goes smoothly all the time.
On more than one occasion they had to push vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be received like heroes: a feast, singing and dance, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care really is a cause for celebration, and wave – with its broad smile and unlimited energy – is happy to attend the happy celebration.
The next morning the team starts examining hundreds of patients.
“ We treat 500 people per journey ” says Bwelle.
You will come from a 60 kilometre radius of the village on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a wide range of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document needed for school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team will carry out simple operations with local anaesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or an apartment; after the operation, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the operation and the disinfection equipment is supplied by the group generator, so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It is a strenuous task, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“ They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work, ” says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year, and knows that its work has made a huge difference to the people it is helping.
A man explained that the free operation of a fracture he had received now allowed him to work again.
“ That changes the future of my family, ” man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle is also working in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit-making activities, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“ I really don ’ t know when he is sleeping, ” says Katie O ’ Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and works voluntarily in Bwell ’ s group.
He is always either in hospital or he is tempted to raise money for the organisation so that he can go on these campaigns.
This is an opportunity for medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
“ We can attend operations where we help drain blood or consider the instruments to be Dr. Bwelle, ” explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America, as a medical student, in the second year.
Students usually pay for their own trip to Cameroon and often bring donated medical itation.
Once they are in Yaoundé, however, Bwelle will take care of the accommodation, transport and instructions.
" He is undoubtedly a hero, " says O'Malley.
He is devoting his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the near-permanent work is not a burden.
It gives him great pleasure to help others to live a happier life, thereby fulfilling a promise he made to his father.
“ I ’ m so happy to do this work, ” says Bwelle.
And I remember my father.
I hope he sees what I am doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellent Fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel " The Ancient Man and the Sea ", is cut by Horst Janson.
Janson was himself an old rabbit in his profession, the art of acting.
No one can deceive the old man Santiago about fishing.
In this way, the two simply complement each other perfectly.
It is almost thought that you can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man referred to by the fishing boy Manolo.
If Santiago is tired of life bent on the chair, then Janson is it.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is profoundly a character that Janson is excellently mastering.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man, who does not give up and who ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his strength of will.
Janson is largely the only actress on stage.
He managed to focus the attention of the audience, so that his monologues were not bored for a moment.
His efforts to finally move the fish to the surface of the water are so real that spectators forget that the sea is made only of blue bottles of water.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he eds light on the active scene: the Santiago hut, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings the feeling of Cuba with her songs and her splendid voice.
The four musicians play Cuba ’ s rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At a length of about 120 metres, a sewage canal from the Roman period has been preserved below Cologne.
Visitors to Cologne will not miss the cathedral.
Around 157 metres the two towers rise into the sky, making it the second highest church building in Europe.
Few visitors, however, who admire the two delicate church towers, imagine that there is also a lot to discover beneath the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for his guided tours is the Köln-Tourismus Service Centre directly at the cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacularly: " We start in the underground car park, " says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the fathers of the city wanted a city that was appropriate for cars, and therefore, of the remains of the old city wall, only what was not too big stopped.
As a result, most users of the multi-storey car park are now rushing past the Roman remains and only parking their cars.
However, if you take a closer look, you will find an archaeological site in the D2 parking deck, which is separated by metal grids.
You can see ruins, about five metre high, made of hand-made stones.
" They are remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century, " Schulze says.
Before it comes back to light, Schulze lets the participants on the upper level of the park take a look at a sinister shaft, which is 15 metres deep.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, is scarcely noticed.
Nearby stop of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants descend again into the depths.
We are witnessing here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the preacher the CCAA.
A visitor would like to know what CCAA means.
The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ", which means " means " the city of Roman law and the city of the Agrippines, founded under Emperor Claudius on the site of the altar for the cult of the emperor.
And the pretorium is the former palace of governors, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
A tunnel leads from the anteroom of the exhibition to the Roman sewage channel, which has been preserved here at about 120 metres in length.
" You can walk a bit along the so called Cloaca Maxima if you like, " Schulze encourages guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After getting the key at the checkout, it leads the group to a 16 meter deep walkable shaft.
" We are now in Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath, " he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground in order to obtain the groundwater that was essential for the ritual washing.
To this day, at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read through changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archeological area on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work is due to begin shortly.
It will, however, be a few more years before completion.
My leg almost chopped off: New print run of Rocker Process
A bloody attack in the Rockermilieu is reopened after more than four years.
A trial has begun before the District Court of Frankfurt (Oder) for attempted manslaughter, dangerous injury and damage to two 30-year-old.
It goes hand in hand with strict safety precautions.
The defendants remain silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and to have been one of the bandidos at the time.
The Public prosecutor ’ s Office accuses them of having staband and beaten three men in a car with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All the victims have been seriously injured, and a man has almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group of Hell's Angels.
One of them is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It seems to have been preceded by a multi-car chase.
According to the indictment, it was about land fighting and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it had not been possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice overturned the ruling after revising the public prosecutor's office and referred it back to the District Court for retrial.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for another offence.
At the beginning, the main focus was on the reconstruction of the events of the Tatras.
The Commissioner investigating at the time was invited as a witness.
The focus was on mobile conversations between the defendants and others who had been intercepted by the police.
Difficult is that rockers almost always abide by - not testify to - a law in court.
The same is true of the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had packed.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Frankfurt (Oder) said on request that new traces have appeared since the last trial.
Eleven more days are scheduled for the process.
The Discarpding Society is Not Thinking
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it goes home.
The only thing is that hunger is being felt in the bellies of the people on the front-passenger and the rear seats.
Of course, some cocktails or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What could be more obvious than to ride chillted out to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a little bit?
I admit that I am happy to be there when it comes to getting fast food or early in the morning.
Some chips, a cola, a burger - and then not like home and bed!
On the way home, however, the obvious differences between myself and other hungry disco singers make themselves felt.
After all, what should you miss to throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially at the weekends, discarded paper paper are on the outskirts of the road and in parking lots.
'Why?' I wonder.
Are people too doof to take the bags home or to the next rubbish bin?
It is not just the paper that spoils the landscape.
Bags have already concealed transport facilities such as safety barriers, causing accidents.
But it does not reflect what that' disposable society' means, it probably does not even know what that word actually means.
If you are travelling more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you will know what a rear seat can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other rubbish are pilup there.
A few bags would more or less make no difference - unlike the street, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I can see that the day has come when towns and communities will become too stupid - and when fast-food chains will have to demand deposit for their bags.
Obama ’ s Healthcare Policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama backtracked yesterday on his oft-repeated, clear promise: “ If you like your health insurance, you can keep it. ”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurer received a letter of dismissal, the Republicans have accused the president in recent days of deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama put his original promise into perspective.
“ The vast majority of citizens who have working health insurance can keep it, ” he said in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports of the dismissals, Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look at the free market for a new insurance policy.
Most citizens could thus be given better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more cheaply than predicted.
“ You are coming up with a better offer, ” he said.
Not surprisingly, the government said that the 5% of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff, because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“ I would like to say quite directly to these Americans: they deserve better, ” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House ’ s Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, in charge of implementing the Affordable Care Act, declared that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October.
“ I ’ m as frustrated and angry as anyone else, ” she said.
I am determined to restore confidence.
This statement by an angry Sebelius as an adviser behind her at yesterday ’ s House of Representatives hearing was received after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long of Missouri about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of consultation, Long Sebelius repeatedly pushed through the question of why the “ architect ” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to take out a tariff at HealthCare.gov that she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
The government in Jerusalem does not confirm the attack on Syria ’ s Air Force Base
On Thursday, an American official who wanted to remain anonymous told America ’ s news channel CNN that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air force base in Latakia, Syria, the day before.
According to CNN, the aim was' missiles and related equipment' which the Israeli Government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah.
The Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been fired from Wednesday to Thursday on the night, blaming the Israelis for this.
The Israeli television station Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, where Russian S-125 Neva type defence missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and warheads can carry up to 70 kilograms.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli official by saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not certain.
In any case, one of the spokesmen for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said:' We are not commenting on these reports'.
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried earlier, partly successfully, to supply ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that Syria an attempt to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a' red line' that would be followed by a military response.
John Kerry says in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has “ gone unproportionately too far. ”
John Kerry suggested an unexpected admission to a softening of America ’ s defensive stance on its surveillance programs by saying that espionage had “ gone unduly too far ” in certain cases.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he bears responsible, together with Barack Obama, for switching to “ autopilot ” when the whistle blower Edward Snowden ’ s explosive revelations about the NSA ’ s spying activities became public.
The leaked information has unged the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation by its allies.
In a video connected speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said, “ There is no doubt that the President and I and others in government have learned of some things that have gone almost by autopilot, simply because there was the ability to do what dates back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, to September 11. ”
He then became the first senior member of the US government to admit that US espionage had crossed a line, but he also emphasized that no rights had been abused.
He said, “ In some cases, this has gone unreasonably too far. ”
The President is determined to clarify matters and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one needs to feel that this is being abused.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process.
But Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force for good, and that its surveillance had saved many lives.
He added, “ We are facing a new world in which people are ready to blow themselves up. ”
There is radical extremism in the world intent on killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what would happen if we were able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
We have indeed prevented airplane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have heard about such plans beforehand.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to allay concerns about America ’ s alleged espionage and to convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the US in its efforts to combat terrorism, as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs declared on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations because of frustration with National Security Agency monitoring.
“ It is very important for the national security interests of the US that Europeans remain on board in our joint efforts against terrorism, ” said Murphy, who is the first democrat to sit on the Senate and as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear there that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger with the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has recorded millions of telephone data in Europe have weighed down relations with some US allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from Snowden documents that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone and up to 34 other leaders worldwide.
The head of the national secret services, James Clapper, defended espionage as necessary in the case of allies and said that this was common on both sides.
In all this turmoil, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the Congressional visit, which is to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other Members present are due to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some “ serious words. ”
He said that European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes that they themselves have been using for years.
“ While we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they will also have to come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones to spy, ” Murphy phy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is due to visit the Middle East, and Poland this weekend to address the resentment about US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A stubborn violation of the ankle joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga Outside game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz signed a contract from Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
Up to now, he has only been able to do so individually.
" We will decide on his deployment in the short term, " said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalscorer with six hits.
Because the Mainzers already have to dispense with the injured service providers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian appeals against imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced in Phuket to 15 days in ket for wrongly claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June of making a false statement after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men were her her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had come safely to her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they admitted they had invented history.
She was in police custody on site until trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in an adult female prison.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian Rubby League player who has approached the foreign ministry in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about his daughter ’ s wellbeing and wanted her back to Australia.
“ We are very concerned, of course, but we hope she will return home as soon as possible, ” said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the sentence and bailed 50,000 Baht at large.
According to Australian reports, she is now on holiday in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The Court has said that Bamford is represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and has been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
But it is also possible that, following the recent assassination of Michelle Smith Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may seek to improve its battered tourist image, with acquittal.
