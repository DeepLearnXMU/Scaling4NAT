Gutach: Greater safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 metres apart: the new B 3 3 pedestrian light at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - in sight of the older town hall lamps.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or Shield bourachip?
Gutach's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
" The town hall light was installed at the time because it secured the way to school, " Eckert explained yesterday.
The mountain traffic lights safe both cyclists, bus passengers and the inhabitants of Bergle.
The plant, officially entered into operation yesterday, is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ‘ Grub ’.
" With the high volume of traffic and pedestrian, another traffic light had needed for their safety, " says Eckert.
Peter Arnold from the State Council Office of Offenburg also confirms this.
" According to current measurements, some 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33, of of about 10% are heavy goods traffic, " Arnold points out.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: " Safety is easy here, " says Arnold.
A total of four traffic views had been carried out, a roundabout was also considered, but because of the narrowness in the Sulzbachweg weg / Kirchstraße section has discarded.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before during the choice of location of traffic light poles: " By means of an extra transport loaded for us with particularly long wooden trunks load, we tested whether these vehicles could leave from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without kneending the traffic light poles ".
The traffic light system itself cocosts around ,000 ,000 euros is the " most most modern on the market today ", explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs, which shine so vigorously that the lights can be easily recognized by drivers, for example even in the low sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new use just eight watts.
There are three light systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pusthe traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, comes comes directly for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
A further radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be completed.
" If a group or handicapped people take through the streets, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will cross the road safely, " explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver has to think along it here as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: as soon as the traffic lights for pedestrians showed green, an upper class vehicle rusthrough - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has written the needs of his childhood and adolescence from the soul for more than 30 years.
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the propenant to te violence and blunt sexuality, narrowness and lack of joy - have often been described by the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner laureate is best known as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage made of prose texts Gerhard Fresacher compposes a collage of prose texts for his performance ", which is now seen in garage X on St. Peter's Square, hence a collage of prose texts.
For example, the theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel " The serfs " (1987) with prosaminiatures from " body, amlting his family " (2003).
On the largely vactied stage - important proit: a znautical sofa on which allusion is is and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble is ggggling through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little in the text.
The 70-minute performance covers up the template with a plethora of direccases, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic playing forms.
The actresses in particular get their hit in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are hit hard, immersed with their head under water, packed on the wall with their evening ros.
Forsed into cellophane or boats, they touch hit dangerously high stplems through the staging, either monologze loudly or lie completely completely in lenon the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys in this traditional way.
The best moments are the evening when you - singing ranging from Deep Purple to popular songs.
It is only towards the end that the twiturned performance caldown, and Winkler ’ s almost absurd humor flashes.
A blackbox in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying Highway system, and believe that the solution has been found in a small black box that can fit on the dashboard of each car.
The equipment that records every kilometre driven and the information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colourful alliances.
Libertans have allied themselves with environmental groups and argue that the government to be able to use small boxes to record the kilometres travelled – and possibly where they have been driven – and then use the information to calculate tax mofications.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But, while Congress cannot agree to act, several states are not longer any longer.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system over the next ten years, with drivers paying per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This really is a must for our country.
“ It is s nothing we may use, ” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the earned miles with all California nian drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay for these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed by the taxes by Americans pay at the fuel,, is rupt.
But America no longer has as as much as it used to be.
Cars use less petrol.
The state tax on leum of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by even one cent at high fuel prices.
“ The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable, ” says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a Milebased payment system.
“ This is the most alternative in the long run, ” he said.
Burauaucrats call it a miles based user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea appewith urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases.
California ’ s planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state ’ s ambitious, statutory climate change targets.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he sees this as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Reason Foundation ’ s free marketers are also inspired by the idea of making drivers pay after the distance travelled.
“ This is not a tax that disinto a black hole, ” explains Adrian Moore, Vice President for Guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US Transport ministers,,, in a 2011 report called on Congress to move toward Milebased accounting.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would have 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to the concerns of depuarians from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or the city their everyday lives.
Several states and cities are nevertheless moving in this direction on their own.
Most most committed is Oregon, which currently recru5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois tests it with lorries to a limited extent.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently investigating how change introduce the introduced.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical that the government could persecute each of their movements.
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem, ” explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategic and outcomes management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People did not want it.
When the test was launched, ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into flesurveillance devices. ”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology to enable it to capture the kilometers travelled, but not exactly when and where.
According to Khan said, would also rereassure public opinion.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-p company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not originally set in to help states tax drivers.
Rather, its aim was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles elled.
However, the devices she is tested are also of interest to road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded, ” said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intsive ways of implementing this.
In Oregon, planners are experimwith giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles travelled all all residents of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept to a distruicious public by providing it with more functions than less.
In New York City, transport officials want to develop a taxation device that can also pay parking fees, insurance has to be paid only for kilometers driven, and speed data from other vehicles is collected in real time, which allow drivers to avoid congestion.
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system, ” says the city ’ s planning document.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder whether all the talk of paying a mile is not just a huge distrastraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient, ” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission ’ s Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small Team Bats Wve
The Voluntary Fire Brigade handled their test's trial with flying colours despite a lack of personnel.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
In his assumption, departmental commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property in Burgberger Straße.
A short circuit is said to have been created there during sawing.
Two people were injured as a result of the fire and smoking development, one of which was able to send an emergency call.
Two respiratory protection ectors of the Wehr agreed to enter the building after Hans Kammerer ’ first first review.
After a short period of time the first person was found found and led into the outair.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, because a narrow staircase had to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There stored a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
There were also electrical machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack was via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was made via an overflow hydrant about 100 metres away.
Three exteeattacks have now been been out.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also concerned showing showing what can be done with poorfew available available.
In case of an emergency, support is provided through the Königsfeld daily action Group.
The commander was satisfied with the procedure of the exercise.
Networking universities and Companies Important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau HochBlack Forest, President Guido Wolf of the parliament was also explained Titisee-e-Neuabout where tomorrow's workers came from.
At the HochschwarForest Forest Centre, he examined this important issue together with the managing Os of the Vocational Scho, well as the District Gymnasium and the Chairman of the Parental Advisory Board.
" Education is an important location factor, " underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum HochschwarForest.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between Förderzentrum, Kreisggymnasiand the vocational school centre in the Wälderstadt.
He also praised family friendliness in the county.
" It is important to look not only at the family phase, but also, due to demographic change, the phase of caring the care of relatives, " Wolf said.
He also said that more and more employees took care of caring and ing for their relatives.
" Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship, " Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, they continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
" For those who have come to know the benefits of the region during their studies are often preserved by the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills, which helps to strengthen the region, " the President of the Regional Parliament was convinced.
Only if sufficient training places were offered offered can the needs for skilled workers also be met.
In his opinion, the location ational advantage of the district is its advantagelocation location south-west western Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
Furthermore, his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg he experienced the the already already to to local public transport.
'Stay severe and make sure public public transport improves,' he explained to local local cillors present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with Music
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietingen seniors to coffee, cake and then a vesper.
In the past, the elderly were served in the rest area.
In the meantime this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The homwellers looked forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmir entertained with common melodies.
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old school yard to Kirchstraße, which is under renovated, is once again be included on the rehabilitation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days leading up to the kilbig, a small angle wall was built in the first works of the rehabilitation of the front school yard to stabilize and static relieve the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Uricipal Office Office, the further forward is the inclusion the state Monumoffice in the planning and the elaboration of a concept of rehabilitation for the old wall.
According to, a cost calculation is to be carried out by experts, which will then be put on the table of the local council to decide and determine how to proceed.
A decision is expected to be taken as early as next year.
After the refurmediation, pavand tree planting of the old school school yard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912 in the foreseeable future as as as a follow-up measure, the ary wall in need of renovation must be renovated from the scratch and placed on a new structure.
The historic one hundred years year-old delimitation wall of the old school yard to KirKirchstraße is mainly due to water water frofrodamage, as there is no drainage, in in of of renovated and has ararch inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not currently in danger of collapsing.
A firm wall is a prerequisite for a school yard used by pupils, which has been done by the current fortifications.
Originally, school rebishation was planned planned in 2008 2008-2009, but high unplanned expenditure led to a shift.
An important word in the historic renovation of the school wall, which has even been used for filming, will be shared by the National monument office.
Should prestions come from this side, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument ists.
Students of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now taught in a well-renovated old school building with new aorium, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir aims to receive Jazz training in Stuttgart
The ongoing discussions on the future of the hochschulen in Baden-WürWürWürttemberg, Cem Özdemir, Chairman of the Greens, has now also taken involved.
" I think it is wrong to give the holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart, " said Özdemir the " Stuttgart News ".
Jazz and classical cs are belong together at the jazz location in Stuttgart.
In doing doing, Özdemir, who is regarded as a favorite for a direct mandate at the Bundestag elections on 22 September, contradicts the Grün-Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this accelerates a reorganization of the five music hochschulen in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, the Jazz and Pop degree programme to be relocated from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
US Border: " Super-Tunnel unnel " on drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the US, investigators have discovered and closed a' super-tunnel' for drug smuggling.
As US customs authorities announced, the than 500 metre long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks, and an ventilation system.
Three suspects have therefore been arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
According to said, the tunnel had not yet been used.
" These cartels are stupid to think they can be dig g under the radar, " said the Attorney General of the US Southern California District, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Duffy, insured to the drug gangs:' If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money'.
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a ongoing fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Conted by Experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the access is in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 metres into the depth to the actual entrance to the tunnel.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres high height 90 90 centimetres width.
It would thus also have been capable of encouraging illegal immigration into the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine alliance.
The third, a Mexican, was seized for the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened with life imprisonment privonment as a maximum sentence, as officials have said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, as they said at the press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time, however, that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction.
Cococaine is usually smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels.
This demonstrates the " despair " of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug search in San Diego.
They would do everything they could to get to the United States.
No details have been given of the detainees, and at least one is Mexican, they were said.
You have to face prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 Kome Geisinger Christmas Year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 anniversary.
The reence of the first written mention is approaching.
When the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks, jubilee year is over.
Geisingen and church houses were first mentioned together in documents together in 794.
A document was made in churches in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there is due to be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen does currently has a hall, this kick-off event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, a number of events are planned in both Geisingen and church houses.
Church houses will be held in in July on a festive weekend from 18th to 20 July the 1250.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a fesast, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall hall.
On this festive weekend is also the house House House church Festival.
Urban Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is performed on three dates.
On June 21st together with the Sonnwencelebration of the Black Forest Association, on July 12th in the Arena with fireworks and on December December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City jubilee, a new chronicle will also be released.
" It should not only become a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but also a printed work on the Geisinging of today, which consists of of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen, " says mayor Walter Hengstler.
The sosinging of today also celebrates its birthday in 2014, and in 1974 the present space community was carried out with the commungregations.
The new chronicle is to be presented on November 21st or 22nd in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with an evening of customs on the occasion of its 60-year existence, Harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has the festival banquet on 29 March and will celebrates the District Music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at its new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is becoming 150 years old and celebrates this part at the Well Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in documents in 764 in a gift of owned by the St. Gallen Monastery.
The document was made in churches (Hausen)), was then then place court place.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Celebrating this 1250-year-old year for in in 2014, in addition, the local reform is 40 years ago.
TargetRailRail PlCouncil
Should the railway crossing " Am Hirschen " be extensively rebuilt in order to increase road safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach must take EUR 220 000 into its own hands.
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway way line next year.
In particular, safety at railway crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains and other vehicles throughout Germany.
If the municipalities agree with the reconstruction measures, they have to bear the costs by a third, while the rest share the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's master builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the Municipal al Council peculiarities of the Bahcrossing " Am Hirschen ".
There, the city plans to build a dearing at the height of the tunnel in de west of the railway tracks.
Larger vehicles, such as those transporting ltimber, could also be transported without having to block the tracks.
Grielovers therefore proposed that a necessary support wall should be constructed in such a way that the city could broaden the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was a controversial in the local Council, because some Councils questioned the need for road proliferation: Thomas Kipp summed up the critics of critics by saying:' Do we have to take so much money into hand because of so few vehicles?'
Mayor Thomas Haas repected: the railway crossing " Hirschen " is regularly used for langholtransports.
Even wood from the area " Kuhbach " is partially transported over this route, because the vehicles that are up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Häberles brücke because they could not turn off into the main road there.
Moreover, the route served as a reversion for vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
As it is clear that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels will have to be converted and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the' Am' Hirschen' railway crossing can also be important transport significance for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to have the cost of the planned road dening would be examined.
Despite this, a majority of agreed to the reconstruction of the railway crossing, provided condition that the necessary support wall be built in such a way that the city could extend the adjacent road in the direction of " Bahnhofstraße " to around 5.5 metres for meeting traffic for meeting necessary.
The reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery, on the other hand, could lead to a completely different problem, which affects access to the rapidly rising' Geroltzhäuser Weg ".
The administration had the reconstruction plans of the railways examined by the Breinlinger engineering office, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Wegs was easily possible.
The study concluded that it could be ruled out that the inclination conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles being set up.
The responsibility for this, in turn, rests with the city as a road builcarrier.
The rustruction could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the removal of the wood and the turning functioned in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the reconstruction of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
At this point, the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle on the is also significantly lower than at the other railway crossings, because the stop is right next to the middle to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main train station would have to be slowed down this this point that there was no risk of collision.
A majority of them were refused consent to the reconstruction of this railway crossing, because the city of Schiltach would have " solve solve' the problem with sitting vehicles, according to the Councils, because the railway could withdraw from responsibility once the construction work has been completed.
The body considers it problem with the conversions at the " Vor Heubach " and " Vor Kuhbach " railway crossings, for for which crossing agreements have already been made by rail.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Far planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they intend to launch in the next few years.
There were proposals to be from, five are still in the race.
Far Worlds.
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
No one knows whether there are lives in at least some of them.
The choice is difficult: should we search for gravitational waves?
Or would to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for earth-like planets and discover extra-restrial life?
These are the questions questions by those responsible for the European Space Agency Esa.
For their Cosmic Vision programme they are looking for ideas for two major space projects which are intended to make decisive progress in research.
The budget for such' L missions' is about EUR 1 billion each.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were on the agenda, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Many bodies are looking at the proposals and are beating the researchers.
A final decision is to be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee in the next few days.
A total of four major questions have been by by Esa to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme initiated in 2007 2007 will find answers.
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives?
The exact processes of creating stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets that bitbit these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star owns planets, under what circumstances can life be there?
In order to investigate this question, the space telescope " Cheops " will be launched in 2017, which examines 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity.
But the possibilities are limited, cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million million.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, thus searching for " biomarkers ": gases that are an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately shed light on what conditions conditions are for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as its particle radiation with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined as examples.
With the Solar Orbiter, the Esa has already approved an M class mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is to start in 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa foresfor the first the three three L missions of the Cosmic Vision program.
The Juice probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, she reached Jupiter to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
Everyspace offers many opportunities to study matter in extreme conditions and thus examine whether the laws of nature with which we are familiar are still valid there.
Perhaps there may also diverpancies that could show physicists the way to a new theory under which all all known laws of nature can be combined.
How did the universe emerge and what is it of?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to our familiar matter, which consists of stars, planets, and creatures like us, there is dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy whose action accelerates the expansion of space.
So far, researchers have not known which physical laws were in force in the first fraction of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and darkdark energy consist of.
With " Euclid ", the Esa has already approved an M mission here, which is scheduled to be launched for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the entire sky, enabling conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who Could Make the Race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
In the opinion of many experts, the best chance of an L mission have " E-Lisa ", a ambitious concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Physicists mean changes in the structure of spacal time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not yet been proved proven.
Elisa could do that, the scientists behind behind project project.
The mission includes a detector of two or three probes that be stationdeployed in space.
In contrast to installations on Earth, it could also prove gravitational waves that emerged in the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the emergence of the cosmos.
Four other proposals compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called " Athena ", which is explore black holes, explore black holes, " Icy Planets ", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, " prism ", a cosmic background radiation mission mission, and the Exopet Finder der to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
Among other things, proposals have already been made for the return of samples from Mars, Momoon, Venus and asteroid exploration, as well as solar physics.
Snowden willing to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence Whistlebblolower, has declared that he was willing to travel to Berlin and testify to the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented to the media in the media in Berlin on Friday, he writes, “ Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a loywarchip and tries to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment that defence is possible. ”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that international community ’ s support can convince the US government to drop the charge against him.
The indictdged by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Minister of the Interior, Hans-Peter Friedrich said online to time: ‘ If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German representatives, we find ways to make this possible ’.
US-Germany relations are burdened by claims that the NSA has intercepapped ed Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service, said that one should take the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness if possible “ without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US. ”
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published an picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden, he cannot return to Russia if he leaves.
When Snowden says in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there, according to the MP.
Snowden says in his letter that he faces a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that had driven him out of his homeland.
But it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression. ”
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a public merit.
In his letter, Snowden offers an offer of cooperation to German authorities “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved. ”
Frontier Airlines charges ges Hand Baggage charges
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to US $100 from passengers wishing to store hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for one piece of hand baggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement's announcement announced that passengers were allowed to keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat office, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier declared to was ate $25 if the fee is paid in advance and $100 for travellers who paid only at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee is aimed at getting travellers to take of payment in advance.
“ We don ’ t want to charge this sum, ” she explained.
Airlines began charging for the first and second pieces of checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore dumped as much as possible into their hand baggage, with the result that the boxes above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fges are one way to get passengers to less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money.
It is about Frontier ’ s most loyal customers, who have clearly stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the comabove the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take piece of baggage of him at the Frontier boarding gate, but the next person may have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of baggage.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and the check-in procedures are being changed so that passengers were informed of it before they came to the boarding gate.
The new hand baggage fee from Frontier will not take effect until the summer, an exact date does not yet exist.
Passengers often complain at baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that transporting the baggage cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they so wish.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them, however, have left their fingers of hand baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded the first fee for hand baggage three years ago, and later followed by Allegiant Air, including a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional charges.
He estimated in a report 2011 2011 that Spirit ’ hand baggage fee fee brings USD 50 million a year.
Sorensen, who used to be a leader at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate if passengers were confronted with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage fee.
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth I have experienced in my career in aviation, ” he said.
I expected to see crakneling of teeth and tangible discussions at the boarding gate.
“ The plane was full, ” he declared, “ and boarding ran like lubricated. ”
Frontier also follows Spirit with the $2 required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice are allowed to keep all entire can and coffee will be refilled free of charge.
Water remains free of charge.
US Airways had briefly tried to charge money for soft drinks in 2008, but undversthis seven months later after passengers complained and no no large company had resuit.
Frontiers's Step to charge for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest latest to stedirect customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz between $10 $25 per ticket sold.
This gives all airlines an incentive to get passengers to buy directly from them rather than through an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to only half half as many flflyer when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were cut again to 25% of the route.
An flight journey booked with a third party with Frontier exceedover 1000 miles will therefore only earn 250 miles to customers.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base based in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revens fell by 9% and flight capacity shrlined just under 13 percent in the first quarter, as stated in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings,..
Republic has tried to control Frontier's finances as part of the sale of society.
Provers come from the Bible
About 40 women visited the last women's spring this year in the Protestant parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the municipal House were " proververbis from the Bible " and " Middle medieval phrases ".
Zita Köhler, the Chairman of the Church Council, referred to the biblical provers in a speech after breakfast.
" Worays contain life wisdom, regulations, or warnings, " she explained.
She compared several proverbis to the corresponding Bible places and explained the meaning.
She called provers such as: wooden eyes is vigilant, how scales fall from the eyes, turn an eye on someone, there gives the Lord in sleep, and wash his hands of it.
On several occasions the speaker also advised her listeners what proverb they was.
The speech from the Middle Ages was adopted by the church parish Christel Dehner: all good things are three, blue, somewhat blessed.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called' bridges to the past'.
Finally, a raffle was raffled.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously described before they were over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round, candidate mayor or Wager enenegger also ed.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry started at the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 men and men who already work as unskilled in the industry are to be qualified as professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
" New new is that the six-month courses end with degrees, " said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are manifold: they would not make participants unemployed, companies would give have trained professionals who were increasingly absent in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce and Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel- und Gastrestaurant verband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
NSA states that an “ internal error ”, not hackers, is to blame for the site ’ crash.
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that a bug had paralysed its public website for several hours, not hackers, as was claimed online.
“ NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update, ” explained the espionage agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours, and this is still not for some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesman had told ABC News that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ compromised in any way. ”
Secret information is not in jeopardy, the speaker speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website will be flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics is relatively simple, and attacks are not not to penetade the target system ’ s internal network.
The formerly supersecret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency (No such authority), is now now in the bright light and is facing severe criticism after the revelations have become light in recent months about its extensive monitoring program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillued former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the intelligence service eled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted cycycle operation.
Easily, the number of people without jobs fell by 22 to 1,307 in October.
Although the quota was 3.1% better than than last year and also better than in September, " we would have hoped for more, " says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Executive Director of the Agency for Employment in Sonthofen.
Until now, many companies have reacted cautiously to recruitment.
One reason for this, according to Felder-Bauer,:' We have few any workers in craft, health care and care for the elderly'.
Due to the year, job offers for staff in the hotel and catering industry have been being opened since September.
The winter season begins in the middle mid-December.

Loss of profits in Bombardier, following a fall in delivery numbers and orders
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% decline in net profit on Thursday after being under pressure pressure from orders orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter as well as contractual problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go commercially next September, according to the ambitious timetable.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago has been followed by only three more deparches, which makes it doubtful whether the test phase is continuing as planned.
The results fell short forecasts, led to a fall of more than eight% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation from outperform to “ perform perform on Thursday, to ensure that the share has limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
“ Although weaker deliveries for aircraft were expected as far as possible, we are clearly disappointed by the margins in the transport sector, ” said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test programme for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries series of aircraft will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for for the first time in September after months of delays.
But, so far, binding CS7 CSorders have been moderate, as potential buyers want to await the results of the flight tests and see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet aircraft are correct.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the company management also assured analysts and the media that the programme was on the schedule.
“ The test aircraft has no longer remained on ground ground than expected, ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates had been scheduled during the service life of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer plans planning differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then to add a review period, which we have done.
This is done throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it was said from the company.
However, analysts remain sceptical about whether,, 12 months after the maiden flight, the first customer can operate a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier said that it reviewed the commissioning planning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“ The slow progress of the flight test – though it evito correspond to Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015, ” DoDosen said.
In the third quarter, at the end of September 30, Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $147 million or or 8 cents per share of $172 million, or 9 cents per share the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share remains unchanged 9 cents.
Sales fell slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected profits of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a 57 of 57 last year.
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The aerospace order book stood to USD 32.9 billion on 30 September, unchanged compared to 31 December.
“ In the aerospace sector, the results were part to our guidelines, but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing, ” said Beaudoin.
Sales the aerospace erospace fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector has risen by almost 11% to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on 30 September, slightly higher from 31 December.
The profit margin in the area of transport has been affected by settlement problems with some major contracts.
According to corporate governance, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trading on Thursday, Bombardier shares declined by 8.5%, was $4.83 Canadian, after it was also announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette would change to the board.

Cocaine addicts lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must be imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information to underworld size Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer feared that his Secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Lipoplayer Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation for afraid that his secret drug addiction might be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations ating his activities in drug activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The crimin, hailed criminals as a “ first-class ” lawyer nicknamed “ Bash ” was arrested in his house in 2011, supervising the Scarborough police, which he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials observed Scarborough (32) supplying three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was the bar at dinner with colleagues.
The investigation showed that Ditta regularly consumconsumClass A drugs after tests had found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet, and credit cards.
Over an eight month between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine and £200,000 and £200million of £1.5 million worth house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed information information to the criminals for fearing that his drug addiction might be published.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors firm in Blackburn, was found guilty and sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two for objustice justice.
He admitted essed cocaine ownership during a previous survey.
The lawyer was convicted after the police found in their investigation into Scarborough that that he been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta ’ s house and put drugs under the lawyer ’ dustbin with a 60 ity with 60% black golf glove.
Shortly after supplying the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephonDitta, who was in Ewood Park at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
It became known in court that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests had discovered Class A drugs in his hair, walets, and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but disended to take cocaine, saying that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that her discussion was subject to the “ legal secrecy. ”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and taken from a sample of him.
In police interrogation, he stated that he was running an office both under his private address and in the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It became known in court that he had consulted important players in drug trafficking, some of which he had previously represented, following significant arrests and informed of what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you do not break the law. ”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has engaged too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker who drudrugs to his lawyer.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the advocate of these people.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He opposed police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to carry out their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed any misconduct, claiming, “ If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately. ”
But, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said, “ Mr Ditta moved from a criminal defender to a criminal the moment he began to buy drugs from organised criminals. ”
His cocaine dependence dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made recepsensitive to motives tives leading members members organised crime crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public confidence among the public.
Ditta has decaded that trust and is trying to hide behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation into Ditta, which also led to conviction in three cases for possing cocaine and judicial disdation, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows no nobody can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of the plot trade in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five more involved in the drug trafficking have been sentenced to total total of 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself where he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row cell in America as a lawyer that his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.

Haslach: Skepticism gives way increasingly Condence
The 2015 parish council elections, for example, will change fundamental laws in the Haslach SouCare Unit (SE).
There is then only one common parish council left for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies of Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the change.
There is nothing change change the basic decisions of the diocese, it is up up to parish parish authorities to implement them satisfactorily as possible.
During the day, it became particularly clear: skepticism about the new is increasingly reluctant to give way to confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations of 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the very constructive discussions between the six bodies and the main officials of the pastor team were ged.
Regional deo Georg Schmitt explained by means of a presentation the the defined guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach, as a church community, will henceforth a public law body that will enter the rights and obligations of the hitherto six individual church communities.

At least two elected members shall be represented from each parish, and so-called community teams will be set up in the six parishes.
Their task in future will be to promote ecclesiaslife in the town.

They had set themselves the task in 2006,' become one, five stay' and they found that this is not so easy.
The bodies of the Haslach Souarcare Unit then set out to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the local teams.
The papers will be flesh out in further meetings and will be decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the minicare unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, Electricity becomes More expensive
Citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the Managing Director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against SÜDKURIER, a four-person Pfullendorfer family will cost between 70 and 90 euros additional euros per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming increase in prices is the increase in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This levy is re-defined every year in October by the four operators of those of the large power routes.
These quantify the additional costs they ur from the energy of energy energy which they can by y through a levy over the price of electricity.
The Stadtworks of Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
The concrete figures would now have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke could inform their customers next week of the exact price increase.
" We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x, " Bias says, with the number will be more close to the 2 cents.
Trafflights lights on permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light simply becomes not green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the sign of light is broken.
What should we do then - ride on red?
If a person person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorcycle ".
However, the waiting time must be' appropriate', which can be interpreted differently from one case to case.
Becker advises to stay for at least five minutes before the traffic lights can expected disfunction.
Anyone who continues the journey in spite of red light, however must be aware that they are entirely to blame for an accident caused by it.
Those who tolerates less than five minutes may not be wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes of red, a driver ignored the traffic lights and had to answer for a negligent red light infringement.
The traffic lights were not broken, but jumped around to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
The Council Council welcomes solid budgets
Whenever the budget is dealt with in local council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The common coffery in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not known known the administration since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be considered a complete success.
This became clear during the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget, at around EUR 7.6 million, was over EUR 1 million higher than planned.
The surplus in the administrative budget is also around EUR 1 million higher than the approach, at around EUR 1.8 million.
The surplus is mainly due to to higher industrial tax revenues to the community share of the income tax.
The wealth budget, too, was well above the planned planned.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
" This is mainly due to the higher supply from the administrative budget, " says Rothmund.
Since less investments were made in the 2012 financial year than planned, the reserve was also also higher.
In total, the general reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.
mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
" Such a work is not simply shaken out of its sleeve, " praised Gerster with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the local councils were visibly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens dearly.
Due to its good financial situation, the municipality was able to forego high leverage in the past.
This in,, however, according to the Gerster, has often often cut subsidies from the country.
There are preconditions for these subsidies from various compensatory sticks.
Amongst other things, the towns and municipalities applying for grants must have certain rates of verage.
" We need to look at the issue of leverage, as there will be investments in the coming years, for which we would like to see subsidies, " Gerster announced in this context.

UN Prolaims New Goals in Combating Poverty
From United Nations is the United Nations to draw a a of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for the reduction, which, announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document to be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the evening ’ s summit that the time has come to “ think beyond national interests. ”
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch a process to reconcile universal, sustainable development goals, ” he said.
“ These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by member states to achieve our vision of Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the Millennium Development Goals. ”
Even though the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball upper league continues to have a good mood.
coach Tomasz Malmon leaves absolutely no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated by the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
" For I don't know how such a victory is anymore, " Malmon expects a experience of success from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the Third league Reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet taken n out trees, Malmon raises the index finger beforehand.
I have trained many players myself in the A-Jugend.
That is why they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
" It also has to wait to see whether there is still reinforcement from the first, " the SG coach makes clear.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to previous appearances.
Above all, in the cover work and the switching game, was a huge failure.
Recycling of opportunities must definitely definitely improved.
Therefore, I hope that my players have got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing face of clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputto under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the state and and first president of Mozambique, to approve call for peace in a rare public demonstration.
“ We want peace again, we want stability, ” said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, it has exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt labelled “ We Demfor Security ” in Portuguese and has joined the crowd on the independence seat of the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks now, there have been reports almost reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst les since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia, and later by South Africa ’ s apartheigovernment government in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return into full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried worried foreign investors and locals.
Much is akes for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and norththwest coal camps could bring in investments of more than $50 billion in the coming years from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo have amed each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated, when government forces Renami bases attacked and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos ’ spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and uses the organisation of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama regarded himself to be “ “ loser ” who “ wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government. ”
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo would abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT by that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations and do seriously, ” said Mazanga.
Previous talks between parties have done little to resolve the tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
“ We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide heads heads, ” says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiation and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pressing for electoral reform, has already said that she will boycott local November local elections.
Presipresidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos election success has been shrking since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member, vimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – who is about to ign when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy.
“ He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency, ” says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has made unbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South link.
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, which located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where BeiBeira is located using the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga was caucautiously to ask whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique, ” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already worried about corruption, slow progress in development, and a recent kidof kid.
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems, ” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people simply wanted stability.
“ No is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they simply want peace and usable roads again, ” he explained.
Children should be taught with myths and legends as “ role models for life, ” says author author.
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks, ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
But many of the myths are “ far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools, ” which is why Crossley Holland advocated a “ careful selection ” of age-oriented works.
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of the education in America, ” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic ” would “ shut off ” children completely, because in entertaining stories convey the messages “ subliminal. ”
Crossley Holland, which has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Valley, said: “ You can have certain intentions, but you should possibly keep them in the background. ”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convepart hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy ending, but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil.
It must be subliminal portrated, revealed history history, not explained.
This is the old story of showing rather than telling telling.

Shrill Piep disturbs residents idents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily investments on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships over the stockpile.
The company has several iron in fire at the site.
In addition to coal glue imports, Rhenus Midgard relies on wind lage logistics, among other things.
Black shimmerers in the storage site in front of the dike.
Spread two huge blue stockpile shakes and rear chargers or load the coal as needed.
With every movement of the handling devices, a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
" The signals serve security and are required by law, " says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
In the event of unbad wind, this can unfortunately heard widely widely - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city order.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with the people concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, the warning signals are now kept kept quieter by means of technical measures.
He will continue to rely on on open dialogue with his neighbours.
Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal glue for power plants and is one of the big companies in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the lying tub in front of the terminal, which is deepened on 18.5 metres, Capesize bulk carriers have long also been processed here.
" This year we want to break the 3 3 million ton mark at envelope, " says Schrell.
In addition to the ion power plant on site, imported coal goes to inland power stations.
If the GDF Suez power plant goes to grid, just over 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year will be realistic.
The three shi' loaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.

Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: barely a hundred years ago, the artist Frank Fay, who worked as Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the crowd jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay ’ s innovation has been expanded, as recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder founder the the -up -up of Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“ Most of these headliners began at Carolines, then became more and more successful until they were eventually too known to perform in a club, ” Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year ’ s event will include appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy charity event for army eveans in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of the comedians taking part in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as programmes on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the iron, slippery fantasfootball series “ The League ” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the line-emble at both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is the best-known for her viral video series “ Marcel the Shell with Shoes On ”.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racial stfocused on W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival ’ s greatest visitors magnets is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a TV show entitled “ Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg ” on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“ The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry ’ s entire work, ” Steinberg Steinberg.
He told me that when he is here, he sometimes walks through the street between two buildings and thinks: Hey, when I lose all my money, perhaps I live here.
Iran atisatisfacwith the Nuclear NegotiProcess

Uruguay ’ Drama: Boys kill playmdes with Machete
Two children admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 years old had invited their victims to hunt with them on birds.
Armed with machetes and knives, they surprised the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reporting the newspaper El País on Thursday.
They would then have played football in front of their homes in a working-class district.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 km north of the exclusive beach of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger ungwho had taken her with her should testify that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
However, when the girl described the stay before the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
One of the reasons given by the elderly was a rivalry in the football match.
He was provisionvisionbeing admitted to a psychiatric youth institution.
Pimp to risail
For exploitative trafficking in human beings, pimping, threat, insult and dangerous bodily injury, the Konstanz District Court has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. George to three and a half years in prison.
The former German soldier, who worked as a doorafter two operations in Afghanistan, made a confesfesas part of a trial agreement.
In five cases, therefore, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent against their will after a few weeks.
Resistance he used break with violence and threats.
He retained the income of women, some of which have earned for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he blocked women between contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated women, he took them to various brothels in the souwest.
He had them partly monitored there in order to control their revenue.
In court, the accused initially claimed that he suffered from a severe trauma after colleagues died in an explosion in Afghanistan next to him.
After a psychiatric expert suggested serious doubts about mental restrictions, and thus about limited guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the women women.
As a Krio official reported, following an initial complaint, at least four other cases of exploitative trafficking human beings could be identified through telephone surveillance measures.
The interretapped talks have been marked by great aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, where one of the women had discovered blue spots on the whole body, has not said to this day.
It is' a completely broken person' who considers violence and exploitation in this profession to be normal.
The accused regretted his behaviour yesterday.
" He has disached himself from these circles and wants to lead a normal life after detention, " he said.
Oil price of oil continues to USD 96 per barrel.
The price of oil has continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference hearing variety for deliveries in December had fallen e-in e-Europe in late morning on the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell at 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a fall in prices of 5.8% in October.

Over five weeks, the of supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were evidence of increased demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.

Court is blocking the stop and-and-risk decision of the NYPD
On Thursday, a federal court peal court in the US blocked the appointment of a judge calling for changes to the stop and risk program (“ Stop and browse ”) of the New York Police Department, and removed the judge from the case.
The 2nd US Court of Appeal declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until the appeal of the city was decided.
The judge judged in August that the city was in breach of the constitution with the way in which the programme for stopping and consulting people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to help the police amend their directive and training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on Tuesday for call for suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge must be exemped from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the semblance of partisan, partly partly on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the Court ’ s criticism.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people for unduly ately targeting black and Latin American men with the stop and risk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including policy, training and service reforms, and ordered a pilot programme with boddyborne cameras in neighbourhoods where most checks were carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were dismissed after a police control.
An oral negotiation to convenke the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop and risk tactics has been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
Controls of this kind have been place in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded checks during the term of partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, a complaint were brought by four men belonging all minorities minorities which became a collective redaction.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop and risk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police, as well as influence the way other police presidencies use the scheme.
Opponents believe that the changes will dampen the morality of the police, but not crime; nor would money be wasted and the broader broader of a police police, which has been under pressure after the removal of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop and risk practice, which is constitutional, but only reform the way in which the NYPD's controls are implemented.
The Happiness of the Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels can to reach.
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association " Helfende Hand ".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which already had considerable success.
The first chairman Mr Henne reported extensively on the work of the association.
He himself was first in Mauritania ania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajedjedhospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed, the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous on-site operations on several journeys.
During the speeches, pictures of the assignments were shown on a big screen, so that the guests of the jubilee event could get an idea of the actions mentioned.
The desert vehicle of the association has also been shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed equipping this vehicle with photophotovoltasystem system,, according to Henne enne is now planning to advise with the association.
In 2008, the ppei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the sickbay in Socogim in record time of less than a week, a slarea on the outskirts of the capital - volunteer.
Henne also mentioned a new Mother-Child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the maternity clinic in Nagold is to be nationalized.
A lot is being learned in Africa as doctors, according to henne ens, for example selering against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible make as many journeys as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to play in various areas.
In addition, containers containing material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, hospital hospital beds and glasses in March of this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered abundant local colour by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile brick stable and descrithe experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association during their journey to Mauritania.
As his personal motives, he mentioned his work in the field of auditing as a young MEP.
When he realised how much money had been lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a popular budget.
Fuchtel also emphasized the global economy also demands global love of humanity.
Nor is it important to mind that Africa is closer than some think.
It is far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip.
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “ phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation ” in trying to confirm a false tip about an affair committed ththen-Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Public Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC C told the court in Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special advisor, ” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and persecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court learned.
“ According to the prosecprosecutor ’ office, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is not one one in front of people ’ s home and hopes to catch them in fresh action, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction, ” said Edis.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories investigative atively: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the monitoring, there can be the other way.
What about the first?
Does he know phone hacking?
He denies that, but we say, “ And whether he knew. ”
Rumors of Clark ’ s affair were first picked up by NotW s feature editors, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said, “ Don ’ t waste your time, it is related with Charles. ”
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire s apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective ’ s computer on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects. ”
During the time the research was was way, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asked for information about them, explained Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw monitoring of Pawlby ’ s movements.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her with a voice email with the following content: ‘ have have a story we would like to release tomorrow that I would like to talk to Charles Charles. ”
Edis declared that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important figures, such as former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had confronted a married woman for an affair when he himself liliwith co-defendant Rebekah Brooks who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks refuse to conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.
In protest against the planned range tax, French football will indeed go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting will end without without results.
In the conflict over the wealth tax, the government and professional football in France manoeuvred themselves into an impasse after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives and associations representatives at the ÉsséPalace in Paris on Thursday and also listened to their complaints.
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75% levy on income of more than EUR 1 million per year, which all companies in s companies are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained tough.
The strike announced at the end of November will now also be carried through, according the Chief of the Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 scheduled between 29 November and 2 December are therefore cancelled.
Gechingen: No Absolute Protection Can
" We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage ", mayor Jens Häußler opened the civil information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the MunHall to explain the planned measures, ask ask questions, express concerns and put forward ideas.
Häußler made clear:' The final decisions are made by members of the local council'.
The flooding that hit Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009, were a major event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, according to Häußler.
A river basin study had been commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
" The protection of as many ated land as possible is the goal, " says Häußler.
According to the German weather service, the planning of the protection against a according years is to be expected on ed every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In experts, this is known as " HQ 100aKlima ".
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 were equivalent to 1000 000 years of floods.
" There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement, " says Häußler.
In order to achieve the HQ 100aKlima protection, around EUR million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality accounting on around 70% of national aid.
Häußler pointed out, however, that support will only be support if an overall concept is implemented.
To this end, the community needs the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and authorisation procedure must be completed.
In the best case, implementation can begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept that was presented in the municipal Council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the tributary of the river Irm from the Stammheim Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Among other things, it has been called into question why more dams and reservoirs are not planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal overall.
Moreover addition it is kept to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
There has been resentment the residents of the Alort who suffer suffer from an overload on the channel network, even during normal thunderstorms.
The problem is well known in administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the directives on canal systems were different from those for flood prevention and that this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to design the network of cannetwork in such a way that two to three year old of iny events could be dealt with.
To dimensioning the sewage larger would devour millions.
Serily injured after after Clision
In early Friday afternoon, on the road road near near Revensdorf, two motordrivers were seriously injured in a -tal collision.
The police closed the road completely completely, but could say little about the accident of at first.
However, there are various testimony that should first be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old steder of of VVGolf drove in the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met his Hyundai.
The two vehicles collided, with the woman so heavily trapped that it took the fire brigade barely half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The real cause of the accident remained unresolved.
Both the victims came to nearby hospitals.
The track remained completely closed for about two hours.
He could be called Dostoevsky in the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysicist, his novels and narratives also have something serial.
Amazing is the kinship in the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre, can be understood as the founder and apologet of the Russian soul, Philip K. K. Dick is read as an American prophet at home.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffman cassette distributes two thousand thousand with the 118 narratives.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, securuanism with security, and belief that he are chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, had added drugs to his brain.
He captured, at early on, that the computers are divinties.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine the Creator from his creature.
That is the Blade Runner problem.
That kkilling.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The " Minority Report " dates from 1956, exuating the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
The principle of' pre-crime' is being developed here,' pre-crime', in other words what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Thick's world, frighingly ingly similar to ours, mutants look to the future - and the police are approaching.
" We collect individuals who have not infringed any law, " says the head of the authority.
'We grnatthem them before they can commit a violent crime'.
And: " There are no serious criminals in our society, but we have a criminal al camp full of pesudo criminals ".
They assume that the will happen and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Thick ’ s narrative looks like the blueprint for anti-terrorist laws and the NSA's eavesdrodrozy.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Thick story is not over over.
The chief of police complains that there is no longer a separation of powers, that the military controls everyday life - and what remains of the state.
The supermonitor himself will be monitored and convicted to a future crime.
The system is turning through.
It is perfect, but it is lying.
It invents its own preconditions.
Not only does toleraccept errors and victims, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger that it combats.
Reading Philip K. Dick means constantly getting closer to the truth.
Late ing Fwords to Merkel in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could make statements in his Russian asylum in the late paper around German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Bar Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, reported agency Interfax.
Previously, the Green Bundthe member Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to discuss the affair with him.
NSA revelations heighten ating corporate paranoia of government surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
At the request of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Cob-Terrorism (BBT)) the German German Interior Secgence Service, he was to photograph the umbrella of the US Foreign Office, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, the BPT wanted to demonstrate the existence of monitoring nas and the action led to an change of words between the US and the German State Department in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted once again in September that the US should not use foreign espionage opportunities “ to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profits. ”
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistlelelower employee, began published publishing his illhorn of US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate bosses are no longer sure whether they can take the director at their word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has sped on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the paranoia to a new level through government surveillance.
The camel's back broke the revelation that Chancellor Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone had been ravup, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then management are are certainly potential objectives.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
“ Germany must wake up, ” explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US is poses almost as great a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, to a survey published by EY in July.
But there has been no evidence evidence in Snowden ’ ledocuments that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and that it should reduce its dependence on the US.
Businesses are sceptical about this.
It was proposed in the Bundestag that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open open slowly...
“ That is not how it works, ” says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If we had wanted a strong European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything, except the IT industry.
Yet the reach and technical retlof the US spy authorities uncovered by the Snowden revelations shocked companies that had previously seen China ’ s s greatest risk of spying.
A big change is in cloud computing, because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurisdiction jurisdiction and are potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, following revelations about US data mining activities activities with rism, about 10% of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy uty uty CEO, says, “ We see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago – it reads: where are my data stored and you guarantee that it will remain physically in this judicial area? ”
Many German leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that they must therefore be guarded at all costs.
It is no surprise that economic espionage takes place.
This has always been the case.
“ It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally fundamentally ally due to the current discussion, ” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us at a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate governance does not usually boabout the measures that have been taken, because that gives attackers benefits.
In large companies, employees have long been made sed that taking a free USB stick with you them at a fair or leaving una laptop a attended in the hotel room is not advisable, to put it milleast.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a member of the Management Board at car manufacturer Audi, says that it has been part of the standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as interception devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when they are travelling abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown thrown afterwards.
There is concern, however, that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their niche.
“ Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorised access, ” warns the BVT in a report.
The US warns its companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate ranked France Russia Russia and Israel second behind China in February of the countries used hacking to obtain economic data.
A member of member of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, “ the French are the worst. ”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French interior intelligence service, DCRL, was quoted in an interview given this month: “ The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even working together in the fight against terror, spy on their allies. ”

Parents of a teenager ager Georgia Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
Teteenager parents, whose body was found in a rolled roinger at at the gymnum of his high school, convinced convinced that their son was murdered, explained the family ’ s lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, USA, was found on January 11 in an upright mat behind the gallery in the Schulturnhalle.
The Lowndes County Sheriff investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which this ted ted the 17-year-old family.
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered, ” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You would never have believed that he had died as the Sheriff concluded.
“ They believe that there is no logic in violating the laws of physics and common sense, ” says Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is covered up in order to protect the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
“ Her son went to school to learn and came back in a body bag, ” he comments.
US Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into Johnson ’ s death, because a number of important questions remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow with the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My aim is to find out the truth.
“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation, ’ he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy meant that Johnson died as a result of “ positional suffocation. ”
However, a second autopsy has caused a different cause of death, Moore said.
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed, ” he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into the death Johnson, he would instruct the FBI to carry out the investigation.
A representative of the authority of County ShSheriffs was not prepared to comment immediately at our request on Thursday.
A court in the south of Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities release all the monitoring videos checked by the investigators.
Teenager parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained evidence of how he died.
CDC Pubes school ergergic directives
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with children ’ s food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government, as the number of schoolt-able children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that are intended to raise awareness of food allergies among faculty and staff and how to deal with children that show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin in stock – EpiPen car injection is most frequently used – to counter a potentially lethal oversensitivity reaction.
State legislators have recently changed the rules to schools schools to keep Epinephrin in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “ It feels as if something is pushing my tongue ”, “ My tongue feels as if there is a hair on it ” or “ My tongue crawls ”.
Parents of Intersexual children can choose “ Gender Indefinite ”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with unclear genitals.
Newborn babies are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can indicate “ indefinite ” or “ not stipulated ” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to remove the pressure from parents not to have to make hasty decisions on gender gender gender operations in newborn babies and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person said years later: ‘ I am neither man nor woman. ’
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is not born every year either a boy or as girl.
They are intersexuals, a group covered by the diagnosis “ “ sexual differentiation disorder ” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gerglands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Valais Simpson was perhaps intersexual.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise that the best available information should be for allocate gender if a provision is impossible, not waiting for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding on operation, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “ soundes after a good cause. ”
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention, but most children do not t, ” he said.
You can assign a sexually without operation and then wait as the identity develops.
Scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity at all are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It is like the secret why people are homosexual.
A report report to the European in 2011 states that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender--based, but is due to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male or female, but typically defines both simultaneously or or clearly, as one of them.
These characteristics were reflected in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or chromosomstructures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in working life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who do not correspond gender gender now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female, or “ third sex ’ on official documents.
In June, Australians Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ genderless ” person, after a court granted life maintenance of “ undefined ” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German cards will in future forth have a third allocation, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according a news on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from textbooks.
The US Web site Catholic Online also also against German law on the grounds that “ If the world is dragged into a new new state, where gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, we distort two more pillars of civilization. ”
The mother of a newborn child from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would find it better to give babies a gender at birth.
“ Being parents is already stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child, ” she told the parents ’ website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes have been called Hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Only ten years ago, medicine regarded gender as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being into question, now that we know how complex gender identity is, and that doctors may be wrong, because they do not know what the child feels when they grow up with the sex they assigned.
“ In the mid-twentieth century, this was called a “ psychiatric emergency, ” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, it shcalled not the psypsyatrr,, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitals stems to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was formable.
He coined the term “ gender identity, ” arguing that social and environmental moves – as parents educup a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones, shaping shaping whether a person considered himself male or female.
But, in a 1966 case known called “ John / Joan, ” his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a ched circumccision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then bring it up as a girl.
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which it was not, ” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
According to dresers, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But, in the 1990 ’ s, with the arrival of the Internet, exposed survivors of these gender operations that are “ not happy with the outcome. ”
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
Doctors did not understand whether he had a large clitoris or penis, and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after his birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
“ I knew I was not a girl, ” he told ABCNews.com com.
I was unfortunate, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic.
However, because he was depressive and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical acts.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilised when I was born – and nobody has ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation has made it infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project that intersexual people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that German law may “ encourage standing and stigmatising. ”
“ Many activists are concerned that Germany ’ s decision encourage parents parents make quick decisions and assign “ unfixed ’ to the child, ” she explained.
We fear that this will encourage intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and wait wait it.
But we do not yet know what the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law, because “ it allows adults to be the third sex. ”
“ Adshould be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex, ” she explained.
German law is about assignallocation at birth.
This is not a fight that should force young children to fight at this stage.
When they are grown up, they can decide on their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds others in a self-help group, says that the German law “ powers ” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Due to the recipepttive defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
It has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatry worker.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to have a child by adoption or a surrogate mother.
“ The law gives room to parents, which do not have to rush decisions, ” Baratz said.
It gives them the time to carry out various tests and clarify things, giving them time to write “ male ” or “ female. ”
In this way everything is fine – you pull up child up and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that can no longer be undone.
“ This includes children in the decision and remoates the fear that worries parents because they think they are not doing the right thing, ” she explained.
Ultimately, it is the child that decides the gender that fits better with him – and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make the own themselves.
Unknown Violure Girls by shooting from Car
Unknown people injured injured 12-year-old year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in shooting from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired at a group of children with an air pressure weapon in gene on Thursday evening.
The police in the castle announced this.
The girl had been slightly injured at the left wade.
Rescue services brought the girl to hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also went to a bus stop.
A disc broke down.
They then drove away.
The criminal police are investigated, as said on Friday.
To date, police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet halloween night.
Officials were only called upon to to worn worn children twice to threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in good time and the egg residueggs were immediately away, no material damage should have have been caused.
Furthermore, some of New Year ’ s Eve böller were probably lit in the city area, but here too no material damage has been caused.
A resident in the Bishop Friendship ’ Path reported that his car was wrapped with clop paper and his cydar apertures were stolen.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his raclifblindes tures in the immediate vicinity, which is the police did not have to continue any work.
Living with a Future
Actually Waltraud Ries lives dreamlike.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree, nice neighbour and not too much traffic.
It is only a few minutes from the city by public transport.
" Hopyou you are not afraid of spiders? " asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new flat for my husband and myself for some time.
However, you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider's phobia, but concern concern not being able to cope with the many stairs to the house and the home at old age she explains.
Moreover, since a meniscus us operation, the fif50 has had to experience for hand what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Just recently a book from published on the subject of' Happily in old age - Which form of housing is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age', she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the duplex apartment more than 20 years ago, it was simply a beautiful apartment immersed in greenery.
Today, in the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
She also knows, however, that she is one of the few people to even deal with the issue of' living old age'.
Most crowd it it out as long as possible.
Only the others are get old,' she says she smmile.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great will one worry.
" Then it can be too late, " says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
'But what form of living you choose is always an individual decision,' she explains.
D i e solution is not exist for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they could also fall ill.
And:' Without a good knowledge of the national language you also unite in the Dolce Vita,' gives the specialist book author to iles ers to consider.
Among their models are classic models of care, alternative forms of housing or the frequently cited pensioner Wnetwork.
In old age, everyone has their own ticks and Macks
'For me, however, such a community of would would be nothing' she says with a wink.
Certainly not like a student Wroom with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
" In old age you simply need your returooms, " says Ries.
However, the author does not want to rule out the fact that senior citizens' flatcommunity can still work.
However, this should then be different from the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want one's calm,' she believes.
It is not alone in this opinion, at least in the capital of the country.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as they can' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civi' service life at the age of the state capital.
Your services advises people about about becoming older older.
That is why the elderly in particular would often accept inconveniences and restrictions only to be able to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends to those who are involved in the reconstruction of their house or apartment according to old,, first obtain thorough information and not hire the first best craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for reconstruction in line with age.
Even in the rental apartment one thing or things can be realized, and if it is only the increase in toilet seats, the interior designer decides.
But the existing apartment cannot always be redesigned according to the age and thus barrier-free, no matter beautiful it may be.
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.
Although a stairlift could be installed within the apartment, which would also be cobbled path to the living door, it would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue searching until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she is ries it more than in front of the spider at her home door.
The US WWant to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its stance towards former US intelligence worker Edward Snowden.
He is also accused accused of passing ununauthorised secret information.
So he must face prosecproceedings in the US, said the US State Department spokesman, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Nor would Snowden ’ s recent statements change that.
Previously, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appea meeting with Snowden in SnowMoscow in Moscow to the USA not to continue to punish him.
Psaki stressed that Ströbel ’ s statements are those of a parliament, not that a German member of the government.
In principle, ller Edward Snowden is ready to talk to the German authorities.
First of all, however, he wants his situation to be clarified.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the USA, in an unaddressed letter that the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal federal ney.
The ing has the following wording after a translation distributed by Ströbele:
To the responsible
I have been asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously previously contractually or employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States' Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In my work in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government, which prompled me to act out of my moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was faced a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I currently live in exile and I temporary asylum confergranted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials - including the United States - have judged revelations about a system of all-encompencompasssurveillance surveillance that is accountable to no, as a public service.
These espionage revelations made many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the covert abuse of public confidence.
The benefits to society gained from these findings are becoming increasingly clear;, at the same time, the risks taken have visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a trust trust and is seeks to criminalise and accuse political expression.
Nevertheless, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this detrimental attitude.
I hope that, once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately in the responsible investigation of the facts of the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to the truth authenticauthenticity of the reports of the reports.
I look forward to a meeting with you in your country once the situation has been clarified and I thank you for your efforts to safeguard the international law that protects us all.

Report: The Obama campaign considered replacing Bidds with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 campaign, according to The New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise at the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 campaign Double Down: Game Change 2012. ”
The Times has a copy of the upcoming book, and she reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had conducted “ extensive group meetings and surveys in late 2011 ” to see whether it looks better for Obama ’ s waning hope of re-election to drop bedes.
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times correspondent of national policy, the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of the campaign and and White House staff, notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect of the survey figures on exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly kept secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley, Obama ’ s former campaign leader, Jim Messina, and former White White House senior advisers, David Axelrod, and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change.
Double down claims that Daley has led the lead of efforts exchanging bides, despite their “ narrow personal relationship, ” before finally deciding against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances. ”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing bidids with Clinton.
“ I said a lot of things to consider,, and that was one of them, ” Daley told the magazine.
It is important to remember that the President had terrible survey s at the time, so we thought, “ For God ’ s sake, what are we doing? ”
While Daley described the investigations as “ due diligence, ” Martin told told N ’ AnderAnderson Cooper that a great effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find whether such a move train paying off with regard to the ballot boxes.
“ Don ’ t spend that much money in campaigns on surveys and focus groups if you don not think seriously about something, ” explained Martin on AC360.
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thinking considering an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” for Obama knew about it.
Martin added that double down did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political explorations had reached his desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama knew nothing about the investigations into whether bedes should be dropped in the election.
“ Possible, ” Martin replied.
What happens to my email on the way?
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
Has e-mail technically implemented implemented secrecy y the design when the Internet Internet service similar in the case of conventional mail?
The focus of the conception of early Internet services was on make communication possible.
That is why the basic technical protocols have not taken attention to create a solid basis for audiaudisafe exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more more to an open postcard than a sealed letter.
When user " Anna " sends a mail to " Benni " are the computers of the two directly connected?
Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the mail to the service provider's mail server as the first step.
For example, if you has a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route the mail can run via many other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can call the content from his provider.
Are traditional e-mails read on their way through the net?
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the way.
The provider of provider, it is usually checked whether the mail has a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also performed on the receiver systems.
Furthermore, also check check whether it is troublesome and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also collects the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can provide appropriate links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read e-emails?
The likelihood of unauthorized people reading mail is extremely low.
In theory, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators are often able to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means to intercept or note note e-mails.
There are also possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against reading?
Encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With great technical effort, it is also possible possible concto hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so it it not easy easily recognize who communicated with whom.

Buriting Mother in the Forest and Capa retirement
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He committed the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care allowances.
In order to be able to continue to collect pensions and care allowances, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after a police investigation.
First he he covered up the deaths of the 89-year-olds, then he collected the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old is responsible for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected as early as May: it was became striking that medicines were no longer needed for the needy mother.
The pensioner told the investiger that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to officials, they made to further.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common home for more than 15 years and had had cared for them.
The 67-year-old had finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an duction provided no evidence of a capital crime.
Feel ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first dark-shgaming ice – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a shining delicacy.
He came up with the idea after reading a research into jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to produce the shining protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue during consumption, which increases the pH value in the protein and triggered the light.
Chris explains that the ice cream react to the warmth in the mouth and lights – so the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company, Lick Me I'm Delicious, says: “ The product is incredible, but still at a very early production phase, so you get two grams of it for £200. ”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH value increases and ice illuminlights.
We tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to us to bring it on the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made, because the torellleliaire is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But for do so it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation should become even more ambitious.
He says, ‘ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream ’.
This is in in itself because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I suspect we find a way to achieve it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
After six days of playing, the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball league.
It is all now that Ingo Ehlers's team will will become derby sus TSV Daverden tomorrow, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts again for us.
" I hope that we will finally released our head, " says Ehlers cautiously optimistic.
He finally has his complete team at his disposal, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme.
Daverdes, like us, is relies on tempo.
Therefore, we must keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to increase the cover cover that has recently left anything but a certain impression.
Daverden ’ s Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course course a house number.
But that's why we are far from our favourite, because everything can always happen in the derby.
However, Panitz now wants to go in Morsum to start a series.
Failure is Jan-Malte Jodat.
This is why the A young Joost Windßuß, who is active with double game rights at the A-Youth Bundesleaga HC Bremen, is celebrating his seasonal debut.
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was small, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and disguise for the neighborhood.
Today I have become more like a halloween muffle.
Over the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home, and I am unlikely not do so this year either.
But according to the statistics, I am a black sheep about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million, to be precise – are celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and decorations, according to the US retail Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will amount to about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, charming inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also body seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that the Dafk space men will make it into the installation feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We disguised our dogs last year and were not alone, to my surprise.
Indeed, Americans spend spending $330 million this year on their pets costumes, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of ‘ hot dogs ’.
As sweets sweconcerned, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, slickers, candies and rubber beards.
So good news for,, according to the US Department of Commerce, 41 million people wandering through the quarters by saying “ sweetness or sour. ”
Indeed, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and, let us not decude, eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is sugar-sweet cy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of them are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of confectionery Manufacturers.
That is about nine billion grain grains of corize.
It is a mystery I have not yet been able to solve.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses in which it spells.
They have great names such as “ BehBehind the Walls ” (which is in real prison), ‘ Howl-Ocream ” and ‘ The House of Shock ’.
Indeed, there are 1,200 officially recognised Spuhouses in the United States that earn $500 million proceeds, according to America Haunts, which includes the wonderful photos on which you pe into your troants and then put your friends on Facebook, where you won ’ get rid of them again, and then leave the type you are on with a “ nice facial expression. ”
But let us finally turn to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and carving a pumpkin kin lamp is like the adorment of the Christmas tree – something we did from a very young age.
Fortunately, the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend only only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up to carving the pumpkin,, not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lamp, which is slowly rotting in the front garden, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score real points, call Tinim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something bad from their 921 kilos pumpkin.
Housing fires in Helmbrecht: Rescue have charred bodies
The fire brigade had to leave Helmbrecht on late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire the night to Friday.
The rescue services have a chared body from the house.
Rescue services found a charred corpse in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrecht.
Whether this is a inhabitant is unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames hit out of a window.
The intervention ants went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned completely.
The entire ground floor has been damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
For the time being, the building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first sight.
Germany ’ s largest state church has an open generation to promote the profession of pastor.
Backbackground is a possible lack of parishes: the Evangelic-Lutheran Landeskirche of Hanover expects the number of its approximately 1,800 pastors to be halved by 2030 after the current location.
For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects, said Pastor Mathis Bureau (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and day routine yourself.
For the first time, the Landeskirche has commissioned Burfien commissioned a pastor on a full place to inspire young people to study theology.
At the moment, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after a baccalaureate.
Burfien attricribute back to the process of secularfication: " God's voice is quiet, the world is loud ".
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my calendar and I can set my priorities where I consider it.
Pastors could be very close to the people a pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could make a living on them.
To be sure, more is paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer.
This is to needs of today ’ s young people, who are not only about career, but about meaningful work.
According to the State Church, which covers three-quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors currently retire every year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study start their vicitservice.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, Emsland or Wal land, it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The theology study offers a broad education.
You can even become President of the Federal Republic.

Fire brigade to save a bitch stuck 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous rock montory in a quarry.
Cockerspaniel dog by had run away after a minor road accident.
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her position.
Fire fighters rok on rock faces and saved the dog from safe death.
The fire brigade succeeded in ensuring safety safety bitch sat stuck on a 15-metre high lead in a rock wall.
The nine-month old Cockerspaniel bitch by had ran away after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 to to the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and thank the fire fighters of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately looked for their missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when they ran into the quarry after the small road accident.
At about 2: 15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker carrying out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 metre high paragraph in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station's technical rescue team rushed there and sied down to save Ruby, which was then transported upwards in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “ She was in a dangerous position.
It was in the middle of the rock face, 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen.
But now it is doing well.
She then eaten some dog cakes.
This was a rather unusual effort.
The fact that the dog was discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said, “ Ruby had a giant accident. ”
There was a possibility that she was very seriously injured ended worse worse.
Ruby was brought to a veterinarian, but he found nothing other of exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “ Watch the salrescue was frightening. ”
I could not believe she really really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back in arms.
The veterinsaid that if if exhaustion had become too great and had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firemen have done a great job.
What they have done was really courageous.
We are so thankful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added, “ We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed above. ”
The fire fighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains that he never attacked Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she had worked as a background singer on Jagger ’ s 2004 song Old Habits Die Hard ”.
Perry said that she eaten dinner with the altrocker and that “ he indicged me when I was 18 ’.
She added, “ It ’ long ago ago and he was very nice to me. ”
In a statement, one representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that “ categcategorically denied that he had ever made proximity attempts with Katy Perry. ”
The representative added, “ Perhaps she have confused him with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at this year's rolling Stones tour.
Their new album “ Prism ” immediately rannumber one this week.
George Kerevan: European Unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new hormare of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the Hadrian Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal referred to the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this did not feature in the headlines.
Nor has anyone one mentioned that EU member states often turn ent their strict rules when it is cheaper for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued disrespect for Brussels would only be a small concession in exchange for what is really wanted by the Scots.
So not a story.
And one that has come over the years that it is already like a fossil: for the first time I have heard “ independence means passport controls ” duk at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance under the European tune?
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan to reunite Europe has come to a standstill.
With the euro crisis, the European project officially died.
Across the EU, parties are gaining ground that are hostile to that want to throw the away the euro as a single currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – won just under five million votes in the September federal election, effectively driving elling the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket into which the national economy is forced by adhere to the single currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro ’ s crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – which was only case only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to leave.
Without the possibility of devaluating the local currency, southern Europe finds find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the ‘ green ’ energy on energy down by Brussels – a code to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as electricity for four times the much for gas to the United States.
This is a paralypling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage rules do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being sidelined by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is rising, especially especially in France, the EU former cheerleader.
After the war, France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keeping Germany at bay and raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and has imposed Europe its own economic policy, which is ggling with the battered French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive post-election, putting the ruling socialists in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24% of votes – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot expect right-wing division will automatically benefit the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newgained popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use next year's EU elections to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is perfectly possible – then such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
This is the point I want to make: in the nottoo-distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will meet to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will more to become something of the “ Europe of (sovereign) nations ” that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may persfast to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering with the United States.
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be in Atlantic rain alone.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the final) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can lie themselves in where.
I suspect that Scotland could drive very well in a looser European network if we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other similsimile-thinking countries is easier in a unfederal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing Norway same and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, remarkably, the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe, and won a spectacular majority in 2011, owing the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Treasury Secretary Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-LiLib Demcoalition have responsible.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only only to have austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty ty GroGroup icker
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach adolescence rather than reach their white peers, as research show.
Physical Change Does not immediately mean PPuberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and shamshamirs at the age of seven or eight years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics ’ this year this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endococrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
“ I spend a lot of time reming parents – usually this is no sign that puberty is now occurring quickly, ” explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious indications of development, such as growing breasts, shame and armpit hair, as well body odour, are formerly apparent in girls.
However, there has only been a slight shift in the age of the menarche (first first blood eding occurred) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, just over 12.75 in 1970.
“ When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years for the Menarche, ” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “ Early Early berty among GirGir: The The advisor on dealing with this common problem ”.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty advances.
It is controversial what is indeed the beginning of puberty, but “ early mature ” is needed when breast enlargement is accompanied by a surge in growth before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
If progress is faster, tests by an dicronologist may be indicated in order to eliminate serious problems such as tumors or cystrates.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and rept another sequence: premature aging of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth to growth and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, the speed of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medicdrugs, but he admits: “ suppressing adolescence can alleviate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings of being different from their peers. ”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have period.
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how to handle the hygienic side, ” said Kaplowitz.
“ It was a shock, ” remembers a woman whose daughter received her days at ten days.
Although there were initial signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was emotionally unprepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early adolescence.
But there is no concluevidence that hormones would cause milk or other food, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
Boys enter puberty, much like girls in the past.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged between six nine nine which establishes a link between body fat and entering puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors involved.
In that country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach adolescence rather than reach their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys are growing in facial and shamhair earlier, the trend towards full former puberty is not as pronounced as among girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and shamhair is common even among babies and toddlers.
“ We need to be careful about identifying the true onset of puberty, ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediediatric ococrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician how to talk to their child.
“ This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected, ” advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually acts well.
Girls who bloish early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than intended.
Jumbo manufacturers dispute seat width in the face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers about the breadth of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines are most keen to achieve, but this designated area is the key to claiming efficiency of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
This week, Airbus called for an industry standard with a width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US arch-rival Boeing says that it is the airlines to decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competggling to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-range pilots and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the back part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the economic results results that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design is supposed to deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 777X ” is of 406 people in the tourist seats, which are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus states that the competing version of the A350 transporcarry 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share out technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus is appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take the race with more than 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could mark the start of a new ad war, showing donors an image in which three people are squeezed together in a restaurant, plus the title: “ Would you accept that? ”
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in narrower seats than regional turbo props, ” says Airbus Sales Director John Leahy.
As eating habits change, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970 ’ s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-range travel, and the end of the century, the average male American ’ s weight increased by 10% between 40 40-49, according to the US Department of Health data.
According to US health statistics, the average ist volume in the twenty-first century is 100.8 cm in the twenty-first century.
Airbus says that its rival is adhercking to a 1950s s seating s, when the average volume of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out to showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increased sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing denies Airbus ’ figures on the seating dimensions and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the balance between air fares and establishment.
The company also states that, according to research, the experience in the aircraft is ers on more than the seat width.
“ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe need in order to succeed, ” explains Boeing ’ s cabin expert Kent Craver.
They do not want us to dictto them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
It is about more elbow freedom for passengers, but it is increasingly an issue for manufacturers that can have an impact on sales.
Behind the dispute lies a race for aircraft orders estimated at at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a significant impact on the US or European export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 per cent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the 777X, with its ten seats per row, compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than with machines currently in use with ten seats per row.
“ Boeing is squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products, ” says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for closer arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper air fares.
“ Eighteen inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is driven by the threat 77threat, ” says Mary Kirby, cabin equipment expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a a catalogue suppliers from from which airlines can choose.
The world-'s ing jet vendellers even carry a ybon or measure to measure the setup in the competition.
Even if they advertise comfort, all manufacturers also offer highly compressed jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a ten-seater A350 but says that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of greater cabcabin adaptability and offering wide seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that calls for a new industry standard are likely to evporate, but could distract attention from the wave of 777X sales.
New Anti-Nicotine vaccine could eliminate the smoking pleasure smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the smoking fun.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human tests, further attempts are needed, which can take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good.
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, trying all the methods available on the market, but have seen that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches, ” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified so that a contains contains genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from not experience nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice administto nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
Mce without vaccination, by contrast, would have taken a “ out, ” as researchers declared, a sign that nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the journblatt Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be carried out so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower, because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if certain, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thereby preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“ They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps to abandon the habit, ” he explains.
British scientists have said that the results are interesting but, at the same time have warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi Denies to having been influenced by Obeid
An investigation is being launched against the former Minister of the LaborParty Party JoJoTripodi, New South Wales Wales by the state corruption supervision.
The former NSW minister denies that he changed the rules on maritime lease at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had covert interests in three properties on a state-controlled country.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Against Corruption) expanded Friday into into whether Obeid influenced various ministers of state to w lease contracts at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without tender in August 2005.
Now it now being investigated for the accusation that podi knew of Obeid ’ s hidden t interest the land after Tripodi ’ s former deputy Chief of, Lynne Ashpole testified on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the lease contracts.
The tenants were opposed to this and also wanted longer longer of times.
In 2009, the lease contracts for Circular Quay companies, which contributed the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were extended a public tender.
Tripodi, who was a Port Minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally in favour of public tenders.
But he refused to make the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pressed for a transformation of the government ’ s lease.
A telephone record submitted to the ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Steve Dunn, senior senior official moved to the Port Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
‘ Was was the issue raised in these telephone calls the development of the commercial lease arrangements? ’ asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“ No, ” Tripodi replied.
I do remember what has been discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter aircraft attack acking target in Syria, according to Official ces
Israeli fighter aircraft would have attacked a target in Syria an port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed by a senior official to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the objective had been, but said that it was at least one thing.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-12 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has launched airstrikes on missile supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to authenticity testing.
Within the framework of extended measures, the government is considering an “ authenticity test test for foreign workers with 457 visas.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for the entry of family and friends to Australia.
A proposal for a proposal from the was was today after former Laboratory Party MP, Maxine McKew, condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as insult to Australia ’ s neighbors.
“ Louent explanations such as “ foreigners should stand back, ” and “ Australians first first ” are a very unpleasant relapse in times when unions called for a protected labor market, ” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this has meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region reviw an echo of this historic artifact, that would not surprise me.
The proposal for a discussion outlines twelve measures once envisaged by the former Minister of immigration Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday on talk on human human ggling, has implemented five of the recommended amendments and the others are being considered.
If the ‘ criterion of authenticity ’ is adopted, someone who applies for a visa could be checked to whether ‘ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or relevant person to a relevant person of the supporting company ’.
Companies may also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past, companies initially wanted to support only a small number of workers finally hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum er probably died from a heart attack after arriving the Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin since his father's death on Wednesday, who was also on boat.
Australian authorities brought the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study has announced by the the Government to increase the benefits for Scotland of the HS2 rail project.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to achieve high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England right from the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the ‘ will bring Britain closer together ’ project.
The Scottish Transport Minister, Keith Brown, has said that he is very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2 is 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and the northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is talking to Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route and and travel time improvements for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a journey period of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: ‘ Our objective for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together ’.
We are moving forward with HS2 because it has enormous advantages.
Without it, we are face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland. ”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to “ unequivocally ” for Scottish integration in the HS2 network.
Brown said, “ The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, while Scotland ’ s economic strength provides an argument for rapid rail connections across the UK. ”
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, will bring benefit for all complements the Glasgov-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British ministers next year and deciding the next steps together.
Regulations on electronic aircraft remain in force provisionally in Australia
Australian passengers must continue to turn off tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to ease regulations on such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their policy so that passengers can read, watch videos or play e-books their devices during critical flight flight phases if they are in “ flight mode. ”
For most of the flight, passengers are allowed to so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books at take-off and landing.
Australian companies are monitoring the decision to do enormous amounts of work for US airlines to implement, but do not have immediate plans to amend their rules.
The air traffic control Authority CASA also stated that the announcement would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight still apply in Australia.
‘ CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices on the aircraft ’ has been announced.
The issue is regulated for airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already talked with CASA about increasing the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and said that it is open to change, but that it must be initiated by the legislature.
“ We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after offering (wireless entertainment) during the flight, ” said a spokesman.
Qantas explained that the current rules will be complied to for the time being.
“ Our current guidelines provides that electronic devices may not be used at take-off and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that, ” the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments on regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will certainly look carefully at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision differs for US companies depending to the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disruptions by mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and customer instruction.
“ After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, an can allow passengers to use portable, lighweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers, and smartphones at all levels, ” the FAA announced.
In rare cases, in poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to shut off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seat or in the above the seats at take-off and landing.
In front of the area vierderby against Schalke, BVB trailers with luminaires had provided created ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic, which offered itself to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guest fans with their songs were heard.
The southern Grandstand, on the other hand, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - VB fans fans stand, initially presented themselves exceptionally quietly: no songs, no battle ghter.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common beginnering, remained unoccupied.
And at the top of the gallery there was was a big flag with the words' section Stadiban'.
Only when goalkeeper novel Weidenfeller, as always as the first BVB player to the place, burup short-term jubilation.
When his team colleagues followed, there were loud singing and bky scarves - but by no means everywhere.
Nothing rain in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern Grandune.
The fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again again the positive experiences of recent days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause a stir.
Only five minutes before the k-off, the Capo soundbed his platform - and the tangible tension eruped in a loud cwhen when the asked on the slopes of the stadium as usual.
Finally, as always, it was the turn of the Southern Grandune - and finally the dest dest place in the stadium here as usual.
And at the latest when, at the prelstart from the southern stand, the loud call' Derbysieger eger stands up', everything was again as always.
The previous silence was probably a response to what happened of the past few days.
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters had fired light uminaires into the spectators and into the square - meeting almost goalkeepers Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was started late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the leaders of the Dortmund mtras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for fan representatives.
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement, " announced the BVB boss on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from chchoreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
" I have banned this,' he explained.
We cannot abandon the policy of zero tolerance in pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras have been shown various ways of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, Watzke says, the BVB will establish a sanction by the end of next week.
" This will be radical, " insured Watzke.
It is curious to what what the reactions in the southern gallery will be.
Pfouses are booming in Singapore as the Medile-class crisis has arrived
In a Pflhouse in the Bendemeer Shopping centre in Singapore, Janani exchanges Amirthalinga for a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“ My husband and I have just bought a house, all all my money in it, ” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earned $3,000 Singapore dollars (about €1,730) each month as an administrative worker and husband also works, monthly family income is not sufficient, she explains.
Indeed, demand is so high in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt increasing – that ValueMax, where it exchanged, this week became the third deposit listed on the Singapore urur stock Exchange.
The dges of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecure bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhäuser in Singapore demand an effective annual rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, deposit houses offer the advantage that there is not need here to check creditworthiness or proof of income, which is why loans are possible more quickly than in banks.
As a result, millions of people in the region turn to Pfdeposit ouses as families feel the pressure of a rising cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans owing by loose fiscal policies in the developed economies, lower-le-income income families seek for deposit houses to make for the difference with stmbling economies.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly through rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
The Agency estimates that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in terms of GDP.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, an increase of 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about Thailand ’ s high consumer debt, which has emerged out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a fall in consumer demand.
“ Ultimately, this means that as as costs rise, middle-to lower people (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible, ” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highprice in gold prices over the past two years have exacerbated the trend to pledge personal objects, as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash.
In Singapore, about 70% of the pledged objects in the city state ’ 200 200 deposit houses are gold.
People say to themselves, “ The price of gold looks good, mortdge grandmother mother s gold gold chain and bring us back next month. ”
The largest Thai deposit house operator, EasyMoney, has experienced 20% increase in customers in its branches in recent months.
Growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore Singapore wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company finances this by 60% of Singapore ’ s $66 million it earned with the Singapore listing this week.
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that deposit houses would not only offer lower interest rates than other distributors, but would also not directly increase debt.
“ Customers borrow items they already own and the liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase household debt, ” she explains.
The deposit lending business is increasingly accepted socially as short-term, secured financing.
Nor are not all people who use deposit are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax branches to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60% of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all social classes come to us.
“ These include wealthy who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses that need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks, ” says Yeah.
Sometimes they simply need money very quickly.
NSA extraccks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence revelver Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to ate the increasingly explosive NSA late heres.
According to the Green Day member Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence service representative would testify to a German Public Prosecutor or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele told the ARD magazine Panorama.
Resailout package of Australia than $325 million for Tasmanic Health
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions associated with Australia ’ s $325 million bailout package for Tasmanic health care to ensure that state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya liberlibersek announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a higher rate of chronic diseases, and systemic restrictions.
Funding for a four-year period was decided following government consultations with independent TasmanmanMP Andrew Wilkie.
“ The government has put together an emergency rescue package that, in our view, the unique challenges facing the state, ” explained Plibersek today.
The $32-million package includes $31 million in emergency electoral aid.
Another 26600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and grey aract treatment, aim to eliminate residues.
There is also money for Hobart and and Laeston day clinics, better aftercare after in-patient stays, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of an electronic recording system for health data in local hospitals.
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that clinics have have me to be the best way to improve the Tasmanic health system, ” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability from the Tasmanic Government.
The state must maintain the current level of financing in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional money has been spent.
A three-three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if “ it were not accompanied by real reforms that put Tasmanic public health system on a more sustainable course. ”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his urgent for, first made to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system off the list, ” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these elections will largely make up for recent cuts.
But the federal opposition spokesman, Peter Dutton, believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ cobblestone solution. ”
“ We are in a position today because the Laborab Government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system, ” he told ABC TV.
It is not acceptable for a state government to take almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth to raise 300 million and then pretending that this is good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, a monitoring group said
Syria had destroyed important facilities for producing chemical weapons and gas gas munitions, declared the global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group on Thursday, while serious classions arohes in the north of the country near one of the sites where supposedly toxic substances are being stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activists group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war almost three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)) came the day before the date of the.
1 November, which the Damascus organisation, based in The Hague, up to destroy all all chemical weapons facilities or make them ‘ inoperable ’, including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling with ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin to destroy existing weapons and stocks.
It is suspted that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sine gas nerine.
The announcement came at a time when fighting were taking place in the city of Safira on Thursday, when experts say that there is a chemical weapons and storage production facilities, as indicated by the United based Syrian Monitoring Centre for Human Rights.
The activist group persecfollowing the number of deaths via a network of activists in Syria, declared on Thursday that 1,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad ’ s army, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict at 100,000 since March 2011.
This figure has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country.
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels for weeks in Safira, many of whom have links with al-Qaeda groups.
The Centre said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fighting underscores the threat to chemical-weapons inspectors, because their mission to free ate Syria from its toxic toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which are working closely with the United Nations, the team “ is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria. ”
That is why ‘ no further inspection activities are currently planned..
Earlier this week, the inspectors declared that they had completed the first round of reviews and visited 21 of 23 of the sites designated by Damascus.
Due to safety concerns, it was not possible to visit two institutions, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPWC declared that, according to Syrian statements, the two sites had “ been abandoned... and the objects chemical weapons the weapons weapons there had relocated to other facilities inspected. ”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will have to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“ I salute the bravery and courage that have have all shown carrying out the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation, ” said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Supervisory Organization in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad ’ s government and security security, to which many members of the Alawites belong, a secession of Shia Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there was a major explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Anrath at Bali Bali Bomdjudgment
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing in 2002 were angry at the sentence for the last of the instigators to brought to justice because they believed Umar Patek should be shot by by law.
Patek, who was barely ten years as one of the most sought-after people of South-East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
With suspended, he could be dismissed after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A condemnation also made in a number of terrorise-related charges, including a wave of explosives on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The public prosecutor ’ office had called for a life sentence, even if she could have requested the death penalty for the man who is also as the ‘ Demolition man ’ for his reputation as a masterly bomber.
The decision awoused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 30-year-old twin stoters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his fellow conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fiting tears, she said that Patek should been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“ You should put him with a shooting command, ” said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day that I won not get any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when, on 12 October 2002, shortly after 23 p.m. a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked before the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded an explosives filled backpack.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times while hung on a life-support system.
Hughes said that Patek earned the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas, and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.
Indeed, this type should be given the death penalty before everyone else.
Making him alive – no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be to court.
He escaped arrest for almost a decade, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden Laden barely four months later.
During the negotiation, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“ He didn not stand stand, ” said Corteen.
Until recently, he showed no regret for how much suffering he inflicted on other people.
The verdict was place before the 10th anniversary anniversary this year ’ s attack, orating with commemoration ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“ There will be many tears this year, ” said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but not make mobile calls).
Travellers can now use their electronic equipment from departure to landing to read, work, play, listen to music and watch watch, but not not call mobile phones, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they were implemented depended on the respective airline, explained FAA staff Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated air crew training manuals and the rules for sting ing equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA has stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon, ” the FAA announced a announcement.
At present, passengers have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when aircraft doors are closed.
You are not take part it them until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
Upon entering the landing flight, passengers must switch them off and are not allowed to take it again before the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are insured against electronic disruptions could their passengers to use the equipment at take-off, landing and roller field, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted for the use of Wi-Fi at higher heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Air of professional cabin Association, welcomed the changes.
“ If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit, ” Glading commented.
Frankly, we are tired of having to feel like watchdogs on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data of less than three kilometres remained prohibited, explained the authority.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no “ Words With Friends, ” the Scrabble resemonline game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines because refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was parked at the boarding gate.
And heavier equipment, such as laptops, must continue to be stored, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight also remain prohibited.
Regulatory competence for telephone calls rests with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic equipment at take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board said that safety safety expert on CBS News that mobile phones are still considered a risk.
“ Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause navigation disturbances, but also because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmission poles, ” says Rosenker.
A industry consultvisory committee set up by the FAA to examine this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic equipment.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of appliances has become ubiquitous.
Some studies say that up to a third of passengers forgot or ignore ignore the equipment switched off.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966, after reports of disturruptions to navigation and communications devices caused by er-led FM radios, which were the latest technical trends.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAA in such a way that electronic do not matter to them.
Airines have been providing Wi-Fi to passengers for several years when the altitude is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-fi systems are also more sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for increasing the use of electronic equipment under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today ’ s electronic devices generally emmuch less radio than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, release only minimal radiation if you roll p.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
One of the advocates ions of the relaxation of passenger on of use is Amazon.com.
In 2011, employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems but could no them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed the disruption by the equipment was real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee have said that there are only few reports from pilots calling for the disdisrupt aircraft systems, and most of them are very old.
However, the FAA Committee recommended that pilots should be allowed to arrange passengers be shut off by passengers in the event of instrument landing under poor visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a sensible adjustment for travellers who would now be extenequipped with equipped.
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with security, ” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Vogel released by air rescue service from North Sea Bolling g.
A bird flown by air rescue to the coast, which had been exhausted on a North Sea drilling e, was released back into nature.
The water rp was fmonth by a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was unled by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “ This water strip was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, stopped by strong winds over the North Sea. ”
It seems that the exhausted bird sought refuge on the driehe.
He added: ‘ He could no longer fly to fly, so we were contacted with the request for help ’.
When they were released, the water strip was fit and healthy.
Is Europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and and defining what those in Britain who provide prosperity and work want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveviewed more than 1,000 business executives who depic, for example, British business sizes, sectors, and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe and and on countries countries are modernise and growing, while states in the EU are stagnating.
They want the government to favour new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than stop in the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
What is views of view on certain legal issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market because, according to companies, the costs of Brussels ’ rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40% of the large companies that are traditionally most pro-European agreed.
Finally, and this probably probably most most, our tioning of business leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement, not a trade relationship with the EU, not on politics.
This realization, found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that takes leadership back to Britain.
The is a high – a change amending the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16% change of opinion in favour to staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that the British economy is behind its plan to renegotiate Britain ’ s conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation to bring a significant shift in power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary now that the eurozone has moves toward a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the results of our survey show, what increased attention means for businesses to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the the beginning of a new era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom Executive Board.
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone: construction on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun, ” said Gazprom ’ s CEO Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is supposed to provide greater diversity on Russia ’ s export routes through Europe.
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk on conventional routes, as officials officials hear.
Miller said that the direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ “ forever. ”
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project comes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction in other subordinate countries is to begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.

Hearation before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff accused of accusations against Jonathan Lord of sexual crimes
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual crimes involving to children before charges were made at child care er Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
But, when the opening declaration to the Commission, the YMCA declared that “ the organization had never had to do with an incident of child sexual abuse. ”
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case where one YMCA employee had been accused of crimes of child pornography and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall had 1991 convicted of abusing children entrusted to him.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisted to the Commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA ’ s opening declaration to the Commission was also imprecise in asserclaim that “ there had been YMCA external reviews that recognised the YMCA as at the forefront of child safety. ”
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA with 21, admitted that the management failed failed “ from me wards ” to hire Lord, not ensuring that employees had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicenced earlier of the year for sexual crimes to 12 boys during his two years of working for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
The YMCA was the only actof GEnterRoddenberry.
The staff said that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, cared for them privately as a babysitter, let them sit on his lap, told one that he liked it, and let children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was a Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior at YMCA Caringbah, was “ very intimidating and very unknown for most time. ”
The CEO said that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord has imtheir judgement, which is why they did not report him.
Hare explained that he had informed the Board of Directors of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson that the organization should learn from the Jonathan-ord incident concerns “ not reporting ” by employees and the Board of Directors agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations occurred been made by the CEO of the YMCA Child Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but this was ‘ overzealous ’ and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children during the Jonathan Lord Lord employed there between 2009 and 2011, explained Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual sexual abuse abuse to the Commission.
He explained that there have been “ serious problems ” in hirecruitment, review, training, training, and employee supervision.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said that he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignoffice, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic political issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as Head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, mostly limiting his comments to foreign policy and his role as Quartet ’ s Quy of peacemakers in the Middle East.
When asked whether he would like to return to prime minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London as saying “ Yes, safe, but that is unlikely to happen, so... ”
When the experts in horse se-ters arrived in droves in Cardiff to cut the horse of the year, they were aware that fierce competition was imminent.
But nobody was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.

Chinese Newspaper is to be “ reformed ” after a call
A Chinese newspaper calling on the front page for the release of a reporter accused of defamation to be reformed said a press regulator.
The Guangzhou New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a sub-state company.
Now the New Express is undergoing “ comprehensive consolidation, ” the regulregulauthority.
The “ Rectification Order ” was issued by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the Neue Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“ The new Express management of the new Express was disordered, ” the regulatory ator announced in a statement.
She said that it was decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw him of his reporting licence. ”
In addition, “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to make a complete revision of the New Express and recommended identifying the relevant persons in charge at the Neue Express and immediately checking the the Neue Express management team. ”
Chen had written several articles for the Neue Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a construction machine manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls on the front page for his release and backed his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for a fee.
“ In this case, I have Zoomlion, as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence, ” he told the state news channel CCTV.
I did so primarily because I was for money and glame.
It has clear to me that I did the wrong thing.
Following Chen ’ s apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page and declared that the had had been checked correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made their confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law earlier this year prohibiting the authorities from forcing someone to accuse themselves.
Discovers the US-Mexico Trag Drug Tunnel
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the tunnel measuring 120 times 90 centimetres as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found.
The tunnel that runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-loaded lorries.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unnoticed noticed, the authorities authorities.
When the tunnel was discovered, eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured according to the Court's records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of owning and intended to sell marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences of between ten years and life life if they is guilty.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive network of underground subaation channels.
The tunnel is the eighth passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which poses the challenge of the drug cartels of how to quickly bring their product to the consumer.
In 2010, authorities found a 640 metre long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residence in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.

According to encyclopaedia, Veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism, but is very different from it.
While vegetarians allow the consumption of cream cake, ice or a strong Edam, these delicacies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to renouncing meat and fish, the vegan refranot from eating animal products - honey is also denied.
One might wonder what remains, but on closer examination, the vegan food world is characterised by considerable ingenuity.
" bread spreads are very popular, " explains Ute Henkelmann, owner of the local Refood House, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
The native New Zealand aly has lived vegan for 13 years, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live.
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became Vegan.
" The conviction came not only because of diet, but also because of the choice of shoes, " says Proctor, who prefers leather to normal leather.
He realised that there is also without animal products in other everyday matters.
First of foremost, vegan is an ethics.
" I don't want animals to die for me, " Proctor says the the xim of the vegans, which covers all consumption patterns.
Instead of mourning behind burgers, stirreggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products and enthusiasm increased.
" It is a double bonus, " says tor says today, " in fact vegan is not not renunciunci, it not an asceticism, it is an enrichment ".
And it is precisely these conditions that made some well-intentioned attempts fail.
" The addiction tive factor is a crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking, " Proctor makes a comparison.
And use it: " Certastes must not be attached to the animal ".
It is often the spices or the way of preparation that make up the taste.
" You can create the same effect in other ways, " the vegan demonstrates.
Proctor brings to a barbecue festival for example as eggplants, mushrooms and also some vegan sausages.
He takes attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should taste solid.
Of course, you want to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate.
" It should taste, but this should not only be reduced to animal food, " says Proctor.
Damage to health and eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me there was a positive aspect to the changeover.
I do not accept foreign cholesterol and I have an increased proportion of vitamin.
There are high-performance athletes who only feed vegan.
" My blood values are excellent, I have myself checked many times, " Proctor says.
In particular, many vegansim critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
" Since animals are nourwith feed instead of gragrazing pasture, it is doubtful whether in the meat purchased in the refrigerest, the vitamin -B12 content is high, " Proctor finds.
Vegegans can also consuthe coenzyme in the form of tablets.
" My B12 values are in order, " he explains.
Proctor does not have to go the long road for obtaining food.
After all, staple foods are available everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
I find everything I need on the ground.
Only from time to time I buy something special.
" Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive, but this is known to be the case with " ordinary " finished products ".
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is be much cheaper and time-consuming than is commonly assumed.
" There is a lot to discover in the kitchen kitchen, with a few small cks you can achieve good, if not not better, results, " says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with his vegan cheese cake, Proctor also amaze his his thers--in-law.
The family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
That is dynamic, when cook together, it has a new meaning.
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves, " Proctor says.
Of course, he has already been sceptical about it.
Do you no longer like my anymore?
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk? " - for such issues, you have to act as a vegan with sensitivity.
'I am not rejecting people, I am part of this society', Proctor does not want to limit enclaclave ase.
And from a more precise, the everyday world does not seem as alien as suspexpected - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as is commonly believed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are chips everywhere!
" Many dönshops offer Falafel, or even a arian yufka, " says Proctor.
In a pizzeria it escapades on pastpasta dishes or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly to adapt for it.
" When I started to eat vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult, " the New Zealanders can find a development:' You have to talk to people, bring them aware to it'.
" If there are enough requests, they may be inclined to supplement the menu, " he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the compartment in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least a vegan meal on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
" Meat courts, on the other hand, are exclusive in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others, " Proctor notes.
" If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most impossible from the outset, " says Proctor.
However, the purchase vegan products may be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially when you learns to understand that you can also contain animal additives as colourers in peanuts, you seem to be leaving leaving quickly by adherethics to so many hurdles and traps.
This is the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book book " " Veganissimo - Animal Indients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients ingredients added both food and detergents.
" Gradually you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have pay attention to " It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble, " Proctor knows.
Veganism is an important moral finger that hats consciousness.
He may not quite be able to disoning his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question their habits critically.

Foreign Property wners Tax on London ’ ’ Spululative bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who imposed a 7% stamp tax in the 2012 budget budget on costing sting more than £2 million and annual fees for buyers hold homes as a company, and as individuals.
Already, revenues from the housing stamp tax in Westminminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which were £708 million in the 10-13 year, exceed proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said, “ After raising the the stamp tax on high-price housing and introducing related legislation to address circumit, it is hard to claim that high-quality real estate is too low, regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system. ”
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more reserved about buying real estate in London, or preventing owners from selling, ” he added.
First-class real estate – the top 5-10% of the housing market by price – in London ’ s prosperous south-thwest belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has made a record 11.8% more expensive last year.
Prices in Central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market, in which the south-western western part of the city, the north 7.7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the connection between a dog ’ s swcoings and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wed to the right with the tail (from the point of view of the dog) while it was the left with nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at Trento University, said, “ People is well known that the left and right half of the brain redifferently to stimulus that arouse positive or negative emotions. ”
Here we have tried to look at this for other species.
He also noted that in dogs, as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for left-left movement, and vice versa, and that the two hemisphes played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral swands of their brefellow,, researchers supervised the animals while watching these films from other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of four-legged pets and analyzed behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the tail moves in one direction or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “ We have shown dogs films films dogs – either either a faiversion of nature or a silsilhouto to eliminate distracting aspects, thus enabling us to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right. ”
When the animals saw an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail linsity was mainly to the the left again again the perspective of the dog dog waving), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that dogs have learned from experience which movements they should worry and when they should not.
He said, ‘ If you have different encounters with other dogs and swallowelling with the tail in one direction is more linked to friendly behavior and the right rather produces a less friendly behavior, you react on the basis of these experiences..
Researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinary surgeons, and trainaches better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behaviour and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal thy at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when watching an aggressive dog and to the right when they are a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria, Canada, said: “ dogs are more likely to approach a robotic dog when his tail wwings on the left and not the right rather than becoming restless – exactly the other way around than in the Italian study. ”
According to him, the differences could stem from the fact that in the various studies the dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halhalhalbrain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception, ” says Bradshaw.
However, since their behaviour is simply apparent, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.

Pope Francis appoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be appointed for the first time new carCatholic Church of the Catholic Church on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and it is they who elect a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal at the age of 80 can no longer take part in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals. ”
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as a consistency, is held.
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene consistency in February in February so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned, ” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals is likely to have fallen by February.
He declared that a Pope usually appoint as many cardinals as necessary, that that number of cardinals eligible to vote be back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he likes.
The consistency next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero says.
At the moment, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and Italy in particular.
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance, ” he said.
Forty% of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the of dindinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to to help him, ” ValValero.
He said that it is “ possible ” for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
So far, however, we have not been in this situation – it is entirely new.
Valero said that typically bishops from large places are typically called to cardinals, but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we don ’ t know who he appoints. ”

The Cry of Despair from an Obama Eler
I elected President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts frustrated by Republican blockade tactics.
The blockade Policy does not apuse Obamacare ’ s site problems, the drone strikes acks
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student year second student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I thought would cher up and give me hope during the grim second year of my medical studies.
It is called The Audacity to Win and portrays Barack Obama ’ s memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient patient in the evening and and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take breath ath from a speech.
The election became a landslide victory, and news spokesmen stopped to demonstrate the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on its way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office then in 2008, he had 82% approval ratings.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening, as like tortaken out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem like a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Something has indeed changed in the years since I first voted.
But it is nothing nothing I could imagined.
I acknowledge the great and multifaceted things that Obama has achieved, from adopting the Affordable Care Act for Health Into to military withdrawal from Iraq, the forced concalsion of homosexuality in the army, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I agree that party-political blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and closing Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But, having defended the Obama Government countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end of my attempts at explain.
I have reached one point of political despair.
Republican blockade policies cannot explain why they allow foreign allowed to eavesdropping or the killing of innocent children by overseas drones.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans ’ privacy, and why whistleblowers are punished who exlose government misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public financing and spending borders are circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House ’ s efforts to silence in the media are the ‘ most aggressive … since the Nixon Government ’.
Finally, it cannot excuse the inability to draw up a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know if that is what should have expected.
Whether I should have understood, at the age of 18 that government could have contradicto its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the Office of Members uties is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and accievents such as the Newdown massacre characterise the public debate.
However, if I look at the examples examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
That is what bothers me most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative; he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from pressure from future elections, would fulfil the hope that we had heard about for so long.
But, with Obama ’ s approval fall to less than 45% this week, this book has made return to 2008 all the tougher.
It awakens my yearing for the many promises that have evaporated.
This week, I read a section of the book describing how Obama suffered a severe loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a meeting with the election workers following the decision, he told his staff that they must get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
“ I want us to rediscover our magic, ” he said.
We must remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr President, and I could not agree more with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflicts of interest on parental leave
The billionaire and deputy Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is a conflict of interests in his plans for parental leave, because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, which is in a judicial dispute over the payment of $6 million in a carbon tax, claimed when he wanted to disep questions whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important to deciding whether to cut or cut CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott ’ s daughters would benefit benefit from the law.
“ He is in a major conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she on holiday, ” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared Palfax the winner of Fairfax's s SunCoast-fax by 53 votes after the recount.
Palmer called for a review of the process of counting votes so that it could proceed more quickly.
Tony Abbotts daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“ We need a better system, ” he said.
Why should we not have a system that invades, entering data into a computer, choosing immediately and then have the result at 6.30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers.
Are you used because you can wiase the results if you do't like them?
Sting with pencils today is unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policies include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new post “ very seriously..
A public office is about serving the public.
“ We are not looking for any reward but that of history, namely that we can serve this community at a critical time, ” he said.
RBS Susends Two Forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, such as two who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global official investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is starting rapidly.
Some of the world ’ s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities in investigating the world ’ s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillions change hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the expanding investigation caused by the libor interbank scandal.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
“ Our investigations into this issue continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators, ” said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation stated that the RBS had ded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a former trader to the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and is said to have been certified by his current position as European head of Forex spopot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was on holiday this week and Matt Gardiner, former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders has been accused of any misconduct.
Usher ’ s instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma declared that it investigexamining alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, FCA CA the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently considering charges that bankers have agreed on currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from the authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has roset traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of the investment units ’ trading trading in in recent years, but has been under pressure this year because low currency volatility restriclimiting speculators ulopportunities.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that, despite the enormous daily volume of foreign-exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and increasing increasing use of own own internal by by mean that “ you can influence the market at very low ticket prices. ”
The news came out the same day that Credit Suisse announced that she terminmissed a trader of her London Exchange Traded finds office this week after causing a loss of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately informed the relevant authorities and worked with them.

A group of the citizens' initiative " Schweizer Wiese " has beautified the fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
It also cleaned and and widened the path, according to a press release.
The planned cover of the disintegrating house at the back of the property was not allowed for safety reasons, because the site is in danger of slipping.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed the embellishment with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the action of the BI, there was a banner with the message' We are in favour'.
However, this did not t the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative little in their action.
Their motto on the big poster was' We are versus building ruins'.
In doing so, it wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by before the " construction site ", it became clear that some citizens believe that many would be better off with realising the city's project, although quite a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project project as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city is delaying these responses, says BI I.
We have heard, the mayor's public statements also have an impact.
In May, he said at the local council meeting that he feared the end would the thermal bath if the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss field in the citizens' decision.
Some therefore seem almost frightened, while others see them as a' crude attempt at blackmail' against the population, according to the BI press release goes on.
The BI thanked donors for the color and all helpers.

As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the " bulls " was disappointed by the referees.
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category swallow kings, " he protected the two offensive spirsters at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest occasion for Rangnik's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3: 0 vsus Val Gardena last Sunday, which a supposed acting became a al to the Senegalese - which was not one, as the TV pictures showed.
" A gross wrong decision, " Rangnick, who described referee Harkam as " completely overstretched..
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Gardena coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He strongly defended his German compatriot: " I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in every individual situation ".
Schmidt himself does not want to had any contact with his colleague the skirirhes of Hütter.
I do not know why.
" I am the one who was insulted, " stressed the 46-year-old.
In view of the success record, however, Rangnick gave a sound of praise.
" There are only two words for this: really good, " he said.
There is not much wrong.
The way in which the team team plays is impressive.
This should continue.
There will be any changes in change in winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change things.
" Apart ept a player, comes es with the desire to leave the club, " Rangnick made clear.
Supreme Court ProfirObama ’ s Health Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court today decided that the closely linked health law of Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which forces US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority.
Chief Ju, John Roberts, sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judge Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy voted against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 200 pages of law, and considered that the health law ’ s requirement position that states either either extend access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise all state medicaid funding would be deleted was not constitutionally restrictive.
The case against the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decisifirmly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway ’ s Norwegian Place Giant Mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their darker valley.
Due to the low level of sunlight, the Rjukan located in the Vestfjord Valley usually sinks into the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at an altitude of 45 metres, a century dream became true on Wednesday.
" Finally! ", mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the start ceremony on the channel TV2.
Some inhabitants of the valley withup sun loungers, others used sunglasses for safety reasons.
Up to now, sun-hungry ppers have had to take a cable car to a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
This basic idea, however, has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council had finally adopted the project coSEK 5 million (around EUR 615 000).
A similar construction has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine village of Viganella for several years.
Hardly Empty Post Post on Sundays
" Many citizens will not have noticed noticed that the red dots for Sunday sleetts are still at various post boxes in the core city and parts of the, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptying no longer takes place on Sundays and holidays, " says the FDP.
A request from the FDP has confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays empis is only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether emptied will be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in response to the FDP ’ s request.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the German Free Free Democratic Party, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to insist on here.
Sunday days is an important postal service, especially for appointment mail.
'This undertaking is radically and unreasonable to these, despite the increase in the price of letters in January 2013'.
Thomas Bittner, chairchairman of the Liberal group and city association, supports his group colleagues:' What annoys me is the fact that vacvactimes are being sursectiously changed or deleted'.
The post office is miles away from bringing it closer to the citizens.
" At least the post boxes in the Neuschloß and Rosengarten districts must be emptied again on Sundays, " says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
It also applies to the core city, especially non-mobile citizens should also be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday sleerts on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament if the city council is planning post discussions on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
However, his knowledge there is also a Sunday sleep in Hofheim.
Your party has of course itself in favour of privatisation.
" Then decisions will be taken elsewhere, " said ier said.

Public transport will also become more expensive.

On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000.
Vote here or with your Mobile Device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote in the top 10 for him or one of the other heroes to choose him the “ CNN Hero of the Year ”.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father repeatedly losing consciousness and travelelled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain and causing a haematome to impair him for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, ” says Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken it out of Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals for the treatment they had to offer.
“ It ’ s not easy, ” comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to hospital to be the first, and you are not first.
There are a great number of patients.
Some people are even dying because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since well well's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroons could not afford to visit.
Two out of the country ’ five people live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of domestic health-care spending is private.
“ The only problem they have is poverty, ” Bwelle Bsaid.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffering mature in Bwelle the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his voluntary team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and worked as a vessel surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas at weekends and offers free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people forced on minibuses buses use the snow-covered medical equipment on the roof across unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
Not everything not always run smoothly.
On more than once they have had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive they will be received like heroes: a feast, singing and dance and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care really is a cause to celebration, and wave – with its wide smile and boundless energy – is welcome at a happy celebration.
The next morning, the team will start investigating hundreds of patients.
“ We treat 500 people per journey, ” says BBwelle.
You come from a 60 km radius around the village – on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides healthcare in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple local anaesthesia operations.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or an apartment; after the operation, patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the operation and the disinfection equipment is supplied by the group generator and so the wave and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It is a strenuous hump, but village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“ They drudrum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work, ” says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team will return to the city, tired but proud of of the work it has done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year, knows that the work of it makes a huge difference for the people it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a rupture he had received now allowed him to work again.
“ This changes the future of my family, ” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activities, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“ I really don't t when when he slesleeping, ” KKatie O MalMalley who studied medicine medicine Drexel xel in Philadelphia in the second year and works voluntered in Bwell well s group.
He is always either in hospital or tempted to raise money for the organisation so that he can go to these campaigns.
This is an opportunity for medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support wave, to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
“ We can be present in operations where we help to off blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle, " explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated sanmaterial.
But once you are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes care of the accommodation, transport and guidance.

For wave wave, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, thereby fulfilling a promise made to his father, gives him great pleasure.
“ I am so happy happy to do this work, ” says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Mastering the Comattle First
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel " The Old Man and the Sea ", is cut by Horst Janson.
Janson is an old rabbit in his profession, acting.
No one can deceive the old man man Santiago while fishing.
This is the two simply complement each other magnificently.
It is almost thought to can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man referred to by the boy Manolo.
If Santiago sits tired of life bowed on the chair, that is real with Janson.
In addition, the role of old fisherman is a characteristic character that Janson mastered excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and also his will.
Janson is largely on stage as the sole agonist.
He managed to attract the audience ’ s attention so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that spectators forget that the sea is made up up of blue bottles of water.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act on boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance he brings to light the active scene: the hut of, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings Cuba ’ s of feeling with her songs and splendid voice.
The four musicians play Cuba ’ s rhythm at the same and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism ’ Descent to the Romans
At a length of about 120 metres, a sewage channel from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, you will't past the Cathedral.
Around 157 metres the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who advel at the two delicate church towers suspect that there is also a lot lot be discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for his guided tours is the Service Centre of Köln-Tourism directly at the cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacular: " We start in the underground car park,, says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a city that was to cars, so of the remains of the old city wall only only that was not too big remained.
Therefore, most users of the multi-storey car park hurhurush past the remains of Rome and only drop off their cars.
But if you look more closely, you will find an archaeological site separated by metal grids ds in Parkdeck D2.
You can see ruins made of handheld stones are about five metres high.
" These are remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century BC, " says ze ze.
Before it comes back to light, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a glilook at a dark, 15 metdeep shaft.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticnoticed.
The nearest stop of the tour is the preetorium, and here the participants descend again into the depths.
Here we are witnessing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the preor of CCAA.
A visitor would like to know what CCAA means.
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ", which in good German as much " " City Roman Roman law the city of the Agrippine people, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar " for the imperial cult ".
And the pretorium is the former governor palace, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the anteroom of the exhibition is access to the tunnel to the Roman sewage, which has been preserved here at a length of about 120 metres.
" You can walk along a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you like, " Schulze encourages the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After taking the key at the checkoffice, he leads the group to a 16 metre deep, walkable pit.
" We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath, " he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater, which was essential for ritual washing.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe becomes part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square, for which construction is due to begin shortly.
However, it will take several years before it is completed.
leg almost hacked: Reedition of Rocker Process
A bloody attack in the Rockerenvironment will being reopened after more than four years.
A trial for attempted homslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and damage to property against two 30-old started before the Frankfurt District Court (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants remained silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rorock scene and were one of the bandidos at the time.
The Public Prosecutor's Office accuses them of, together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt, of elling and beating three men on a car in June 2009.
All the victims have been seriously injured and a man almost lost his leg.
Victims are said to have been the competing group of Hells Angels.
One of them is geto been a senior member from Berlin.
It seemed to be preceded by a multi-car chase.
According to the indictment it it about about fighting and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
One court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proved that men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had been worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice overturned the ruling following revision revision the Public Proprosecutor's Office and referred it back to the District Court for reotiation.
One of the defendants is currently being execution because of another offence.
At the beginning, the main focus was the reconstruction of the procedures of Tatnight.
As a witness, the Commissioner investigating at the time was invited.
The focus was on mobile phone talks between the defendants and others who had intercepapped the police.
It is difficult is that rockers almost always adhere to - not testify - former law for them in court.
The same applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had packed.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public prosecutor ’ s Office in Frankfurt (Oder) said on request that new traces had appeared since the last trial.
Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the process.
The Disable Society Not Ththink
The night was long, the music loud and mood mood good, but at some point things go home.
The only thing is that hunger is felt in the bellies of the people on the front-passenger and back seats.
Of course, one or two cocktail or champagne may be responsible for this!
What could be more obvious than chillled to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a small bit?
I admit that I am happy to be me when it goes to fast food food late or early in the morning.
A few chips, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and to bed!
But on the way home, the apparent differences between me and other hungry disco geare appear.
What do you miss to to throwing your fast-food bags out of the car window with constant regul?!
Especially at weekends there are discarded paper bags at the edge of the road and in parking spaces.
'Why?' I wonder.
Are the too doof of to the bags back home or to the next rubstbin?
It is not only the case that the paper tool spoils the landscape.
Tuags have already concetransport facilities such as control barriers, thereby causing accidents.
But what is the' disposable society society' that that thinks, probably it does not even know what that word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a rear seat can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other rubbish are floup.
A few bags would more or less not make up there - unlike the street, where no one wants to trample on others's food resitovers.
I can see the day coming when the towns and municipalities become become stupid - and the fastfast food chains to demand deposit for their bags.
Obama ’ s Returward in Health Policy
After strong criticism, President Obama backtracked yesterday on his oft-repeated, clear promise: “ If you like your health insurance, you can keep it. ”
After received hundreds of thousands receiving a letter of dismissal from their insurer, the Republicans have accused the president in recent days of deceived the American public.
Yesterday, Obama put his promise in promise.
“ The vast majority of citizens with functioning health insurance can keep it, ” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama asked those Americans who received such communications to look in the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than is predicted.
“ You are getting a better offer, ” he said.
Not surprisingly, the government described that the five% of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look at a different tariff, because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“ I would like to say very directly to these Americans: they deserve better, ” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House of Representatives ’ s Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, in charge implementing implementing the Affordable Care Act, declared that the launch of the online platform had been “ miserable ” since October.
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else, ” she said.
I am determined to regain your confidence.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to an adviser behind her at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was began after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri, about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly squeghed by asking why the Affordable Care Act ’ s “ architect ” did not voluntarily renup government-sponsored insurance to take out a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Jerusalem Government does not confirm the attack on Syria ’ s Air Base
An American official who wanted to remain anonymous anonymous told to the American news channel CNN on Thursday that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air base in Syrian Latakia the day earlier.
The aim was' rockets and related equipment', the Israeli Government Government feared had been destined the Lebanese Hezbollah, according to the CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was shelled from night to Thursday on Thursday, and blthe Israelis responsible for it.
The Israeli television station Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia showing Russian S-125 Neva defence missiles and a SA-3 rocket battery, according to 2 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and allow warheads to transport up to 70 kilograms.
Incourse, the government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli government official saying saying he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not safe.
In any case, a spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said:' We are not commenting on these reports'.
Journjournalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had previously, partly successfully, tried to deliver Boden-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that attempt by attempt to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant crossing a' red line' that would be followed by a military response.
John Kerry says in an unprecedented admission that US espionage “ “ gone too too far. ”
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, a weakening of the US defensive stance on its surveillance programs by saying that espionage had “ gone unduly too far ” in some cases.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, with Barack Obama Obama responsibility for switching aging on “ autopilot ” when explosive revelations of the whistle-blowers Edward Snowden became public about the NSA ’ s spactivities.
The leaked information has put the US government into a diplomatic storm of indigngnpart by its allies.
In a video-bound speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said, “ There is no doubt that the President and I and others in the government learned about some of the things that happened almost by autopilot, simply because of was ability to do so dates back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, September September 11. ”
He was then the first senior member of the US government to admit that US espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, ‘ In some cases this has gone unduly too far ’.
The President is determined to clarify matters is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuses are taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process.
But Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance.
He added, “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves up. ”
There is radical extremism in the world obsessed on killing, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what would happen if we were able to absorb and stop it before it happens?
We have indeed prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have learned about such plans beforehand.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to allay concerns about alleged American espionage, and to convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the US in the anti-terrorist effort, as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs stated on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he has spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and others people this week and is concerned about their threats to taking participate in anti-terrorist organisations due of the frustration with monitoring by the National Security Agency.
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board board in our joint efforts against terrorism, ” said Murphy, who is ts in the Senate for the first time for the first rat and is Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear we we continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger at the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were incorrect and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents sent by Snowden that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world.
The head of the national secret services, James Clapper, defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared that this was custompractice on both sides.
In all this commmoil, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the trip of the Congress to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members are due to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some “ serious words. ”
He said that European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes that they themselves have used for years.
“ While we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy y, ” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is about to travel to the Middle East and Poland at the weekend to address the resentment at America ’ US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.

Australian appeappeals for prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for wronakly claiming that she have been raped a taxi taxi, appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to make a false statement after after ing to the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday 10 10, while two other men held them.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had entered her hotel safely after she was separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she admitted to thought invented history.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the ground.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phuket, than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Ruby League ue who contached the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help with his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about his daughter ’ s well-being and wanted to have her back in Australia.
“ We are very concerned, of course, but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible, ” Tunks ks.
Bamford has appealed against the ruling and is at liberty against a deposit of 50,000 Baht.
Australian reports reported that in the meantime she is on holiday in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The Court has said that Bamford is represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and has been warned that the appeal could lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that, following the recent assassination of travel clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may seek to improve its battered tourist image, resulting a acquittal.
