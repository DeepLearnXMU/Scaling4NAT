Gutach: Greater safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 metres apart: on Tuesday, the new B33 pedestrian light at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older town hall lights.
Two installations so close to each other: intentional or toryise roke?
Experach's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
" The town hall light was installed at that time because it ensures the way to school, " Eckert explained yesterday.
The cable traffic lights are safe cyclists as well as bus guests and mountain residents.
The plant officially officially put into operation yesterday was important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße intersection area.
We have the museum, two churches, the spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the flow from the residential area ‘ Grub ’.
" With the high volume of traffic and pedestrians, another traffic light was necessary for their safety, " EckEckert.
Peter Arnold of the Offenburg LandOffOffice also confirms this.
" According to current measurements, around 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 every day, of which about 10% are heavy goods vehicles, " stresses Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary:' Safety is an for here', says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, and a roundabout was also considered, but discarded again due to the narrowness in the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße interroads.
According to Arnold, everything was previously tested during the choice of the of the traffic es: " By means of a transporter loaded with particularly long trunof wood loaded for us, we tested whether these vehicles could leave from the Sulzbzbach il to the B 33 without bending on the traffic light poles ".
The traffic light system itself, which cocost around EUR 15 000, is " the most modern that is on the market today, " Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so vigorously that the lights can be easily seen by drivers even in the sunsun, for example.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones me only eight watts.
There are three light bulper each direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian turns the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is free, it comes directly green for pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor examines whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be completed.
" Should a group or disabled people take to the streets, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will travel safely across the road, " explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver has to think along mind this this a partner here and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: as soon as the traffic lights showed green for pedestrians, an upper class vehicle rusked through - with glowing red.
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The disasters of his Catholic village children - speechlessness, the tendency towards brute force and blunt sexuality, narrowness and joylessness - have been described many times by the Carinthian poet.
The winner of the Büchner Prize is best known as a prose author, theatre texts are scarce in his work.
Collage made of prose texts Gerhard Fresacher composes a collage of prose texts for his performance " Weather lights on the tip of tontongue ", which can now be seen in Garage X on St. Peter's Square.
The theatre maker, for example, combines elements from the autobiographical novel " Der Leibeigene " (1987) with prosaminiatures from " Body nam, Entivating his family " (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important props: a twinauged sofa on which hinhints is copied and masturbated - the eight-person ensemble anders s the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to trust little in the text.
The 70-minute performance covers up the original with a wealth of direccases, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
The actresses in particular are involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched attacked, dipped with their head under water, baked on the wall with their evening robes.
Forced into cellophane or bodice, they stroke on dangerously high stiletths through the staging, either monologze them loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly conveyed in this strict way.
The best moments have the evening when you are sung - ranging from Deep Purple to popular songs.
It is only towards the end that the overturned performance comes a little calrest, and Winkler ’ s almost absurd humor flashes.
A black box in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway system, believing that they have found the solution in a small black box that can fit every car ’ s dashboard.
The equipment that records every kilometeter driven and reports information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked ed intense debate with colourful alliances.
Libertans have allied themselves with environmental groups and calling for the government being able to use the small boxes to record the kilometres travelled – and possibly where they have been driven – and then use the information to calculate tax moes.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But, while Congress cannot agree on one approach, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system where drivers pay per mile driven over the next ten years.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This really is a must for our country.
“ It ’ s nothing we we may use, ” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, who is planning a record of miles miles on all Californian drivers in the state from 2025.
The way in pay these taxes them will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed by financed by the taxes paid by Americans at the fuel pump, is bankrupt.
But America no longer has as much fuel as it used to do.
Cars consume less petrol.
The state petroletax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians dare not raise the tax by even cent cent at high fuel prices.
“ The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable, ” says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a milebased payment system.
“ This is the most sensible alternative in the long run, ” he said.
Buraucrats call it a milebased user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea appeto urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases.
California ’ s planners rely on the system to devise strategies to achieve the state ’ s ambitious, legally established climate change goals.
But Republican Bill ennsylvania ennShuster, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he sees this as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also fond by the idea of making drivers pay after a distance travelled.
“ This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole, ” explains Adrian Moore, Vice President for Guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US Transport Ministers who, in a 2011 report calling on Congress to move toward milebased billing.
The US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, covering $10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to the concerns of rural depuwho represent people who often travel many miles on their way to work or the city in their daily lives.
Several states and large cities are nevertheless moving in this direction on their own.
Most committed is Oregon, which is currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s greatest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees to the state instead of of fuel oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois tests with lorries to a limited extent.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the ministries of transport of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical about thinking that the government could follow each of their movements.
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem, ” explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategic and Outcome Management at the Ministry of Transport in Nevada.
People did not want it.
When the test started, Nevada ACLU warned on its Web site: “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into fully-fledged surveillance. ”
There is no need to build a gigantic, obscsome technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology to enable governments to capture the kilometers travelled, but not exactly when and where.
That, Khan argues, would also reassure public opinion.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not originally take into office to help states tax drivers.
Rather, its aim was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for motor insurance, with drivers having to pay on the basis of the miles earned.
However, the devices it tests are also of interest to the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information which is regularly uploaded via modem.
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded, ” explained Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no equipment at all and instead pay a flat rate based on the average mileage earned by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other bodies hope to sell the concept of a distrustful public by providing devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that can also pay parking fees, insurance only has to be insurance for kilometelled elled elled, and collect real-time speed data from other vehicles that will allow drivers to avoid congestion.
“ Drivers are motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system, ” says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan TransporTransportation for San Francisco Bay, officials declared that Congress Congress solve solve bankrupt Highway Trust Fund problem simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consuvery little petrol, so that they, too, pay a fair share.
“ There is no reason for operation if an aspirin suffsufficient, ” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission ’ s Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small Team Beats Wrester
The Voluntary Fire Brigade passed its men's main test with flying colours, despite a lack of staff.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Departmental commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in Burgberger Straße in his practice.
A short circuit is said to have been made there sawing.
The resulting fire and the development of smoking injured two people people but one of them was still able to send an emergency call.
Two breathing protrters of the Wehrense ade agreed to enter the building after Hans Kammerer ’ s first examination of the situation.
After a short time we managed to find the first person and lead out into the open air.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, because there was also a narrow stairs to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it.
There were also electrical machines for woodworking.
The first deletion attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was place via an flooded hydrante about 100 meters away.
Now three deletion attacks have been designed.
A hollow belast tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also with the exercise of showing what can be done with under-available staff.
In case of an emergency, support will be provided via the Königsfeld daily intervention group.
The commander was satisfied with the progress of the exercise.
Networking universities and companies is important
During his visit to the Breisg-Hochschwarzwald district, President Guido Wolf, President of the Parliament, also enlighten in Titisee-Neustadt about where tomorrow workers of tomorrow came from.
At the Hochschwarzwald FörderCentre, he examined this important issue together with the managing school of of vocational schools as well as the district gymnasium and the chairmen of parents parents Advisory Board.
" Education is an important locational factor, " underlined Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans-ThomSchule, who presented the networked school project Education Center HochBlack Forest.
Wolf was impressed by the educational model projects.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation in Wälderstadt between the Förderzentrum, the Kreisgymnasium and the vocational training centre.
He also praised family friendliness in the district.
" It is important to look not only at the family phase, but also, due to demographic change, at the phase of caring for family members, " Wolf explained.
He also said that more and more employees were care of caring for and caring their loved ones.
" Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the the labour relationship,' Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses.
" For who have already become to ted know the advantages of the region during their studies are often preserved by the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills, which helps to strengthen the region, " the President of the regional parliament was convinced.
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the needs for skilled workers be also be met.
In his opinion, the district ’ s location advantage is its advantageous location in south-west western Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
On his rail journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to develop local public transport.
'Persevere and ensure public public transport improves,' he said to the local councillors present.
Experience an entertaining AfterAfternoon with Music
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cakes and then a vesper.
In the past, the elderly were looked after in the resting place.
In the meantime takes place this afternoon in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The locals looked forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich taught with common melodies.
The more than 100 year old natural stone wall, the the the delimof of the school school yard about to be renovated to the Kirchstraße, is to be included once again on the plan of the costs of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days leading up to Kilbig, during the first work on the renovation of the front courtyard, a small angular wall was installed to stabilize and statically relieve the more than one hundred year old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The further procedure is, according to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlingen City Building Office, to involve the National Monument Office in the planning and to draw up a concept for the rehabilitation of the old wall.
According to this, a cost calculation will be carried out by experts, which will then be submitted to the local council to decide and determine how to proceed.
A decision is expected to be taken as early as next year.
After the renovation, pavement and tree planting of the old school yard within the two side wings of the school, built in 1912, in the foreseeable, in foresforeseeable future, the boundary wall in need of renovation must be completely repaired and placed on a new structure.
The historic, one urd-year-old delimitation wall of the old school yard to the Kirchstraße is in need of renovation mainly due to water and frost damage because there is no drainage, and has an archc inclinmove forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence to weather damage, but the wall is not currently in danger of collapsing.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a school yard used by pupils, which has been done as a result of the current fortifications.
Originally, the school farm was already planned even in 2008 / 2009, but high unscheduled expenditures led in a postponement.
An important word in the historic renovation of the school wall, which has even been used for film filage, will be mentioned by the National Monument Office.
Should there are guidelines from this side, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the conservalists.
Students of the Bräunlinger Primary School, who are now taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new aula, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive Jazzausbildung in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions about the future of music academies in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Chairman of the Greens, has now also participated.
" I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart, " Özdemir said the " Stuttgart News ".
Jazz and classical go hand in hand at the jazz location in Stuttgart.
In doing doing, Özdemir, who is regarded in Stuttgart as the favorite for a direct mandate at the German elections on 22 September, is contrary to the Green / Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, it is accelerating a reorganisation of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, the course programme jazz and pop is to be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
US B: " Super-tunnel " for drug smuggling Discovers
On the border between Mexico and the US, investigators have discovered and closed down a' super tunnel' for drug smuggling.
According to the US customs authorities, the more than 500 metre long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks, and an ventilation system.
Three suspects have therefore been arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated.
According to data, the tunnel had not yet been in use.
" These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig out beneath the radar, " said US District Southern California's Attorney General Laura Duffy at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where an end to the tunnel had been discovered.
Duffy, who plesaid to the drug gangs:' If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money'.
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in a ongoing fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection drudrurelated crime.
Conted by Experts
Due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is is in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 metres into the depth to the actual entrance to the tunnel.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres in height and 90 centimetres wide.
It would thus also have been capable to encouraging illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine group.
The third, a Mexican, was captured for the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened with death punished for life imprislife imprisonment, as officials have said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, according to the press conference conference in ego Diego.
This is the first time, however, that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels.
This is demonstrated by the " despair " of the drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug DEA in San Diego.
They would do everything they could to get to the United States.
No details have been given of the detainees, at least one is Mexican, they was said.
They face prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 will es Geisinger Festival Year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250anniversary.
Returreturn of the first documentary mention is approaching.
When the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks' time, the anniversary year will be approaching.
Geisingen und Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned in documents in 794.
A document has been produced in churches churches mentioning both places.
There will due to official inauenlee bithe anniversary year on 15 March, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this kick-off event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
On the occasion of the anniversary, a number of events in Geisingen as well as in church houses.
Church Hausen be held in July on a festive weekend from July 18th to 20th the 1250.
Celebrate return.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festhere is is the Kirchen-Hausener Church Festival.
Munban Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of its anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On June 21st together with the solvoce ceremony of the Black Forest Association, on July 12th in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13th, as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is be the last weekend of September, September 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the anniversary of the city of Geisinger, a new chronicle will also be released.
" It is to be a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but also a printed work on today's Geisinging, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen, " says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
Today ’ s hostage singing is also celebrating 2014 birthday, and in 1974 today ’ s space space with the commungregations carried completed.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 21 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
But 2014 2014 also another a year with many anniversaries.
The fool's guild of straw glonki begins on 8 February with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60th year existence, the harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has has the banbanquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1st to 4th May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and is celebrating this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this within the framework of the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in documents in a deed of gift by the St. Gallen Monastery in 764.
The certificate was made in churches (lsen), which at that time was a court place.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason for celebrating this 1250-year-old in 2014 is also the community reform 40 years ago.
Council Targets RailTrack Pltions
Should the railway crossing " Am Hirschen " be extensively reconstructed in order to increase road safety?
Yes, the local councouncils decided decision.
Schiltach has to take EUR 220 000 into hand for this.
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, safety at railway crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions between trains and other vehicles nationwide.
If the communities agree to the restructuring measures, they must share one-third of the costs, with rest rest shared by the railways and the federal Government.
Schiltach's master builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the local council the peculiarities of the " Am Hirschen " railway transition.
There, the city plans to build a bay at the height of the tunnel sde west of the railway tracks.
This is where larger vehicles, such as those transporting long-umber, could be be in return without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed that a necessary support wall be designed in such a way that the city could broaden the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This has been controversial in the local council, as some Councils have questioned the need for road proliferation: Thomas Kipp summed up the of critics in his said:' Do we have to take so much money because of so few vehicles?'
Mayor Thomas Haas disected that the " Hirschen " railway crossing is regularly used for long-ghwood transport.
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is transported transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 metres long long would not be able to use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
Moreover, the route served as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
As it is clear that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels will have to be rebuilt and repaired, as is currently the in WolWolfach, railway crossing " Am " Hirschen " " could have have important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to have an investigation into the costs of the planned widening of the roads.
Despite this, a majority of them agreed to the reconstruction of the railway crossing, the condition that the necessary support wall be built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road in the direction of " Bahnhofstraße " to around 5.5 metres if necessary for meeting traffic.
The reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery, on the other hand, could lead to a completely different problem, which relates to access to the rapidly increasing " Geroltzhäuser Weg ".
The administration had had the reconstruction plans of the railway examined by the engineering office Breinlinger, because it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser weg would then be easily possible.
The study concluded that it cannot be ruled out that the inclination of the road could lead to longer vehicles being seated.
The responsibility for this, in turn, lies with the city as a road developer.
The ovcould therefore give rise to disputes of liability.
Since both wood collection and turning worked in the current state of construction, one should not agree to the reconstruction of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
At this point, the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle in transition is also significantly lower than at the other railway crossings, because there is a stop next to the stop to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main train station should have been slowed down at this point that there is no risk of a collision.
A majority of them refused refused to the reconstruction of this railway crossing, as the city of Schiltach would " have to pay for " the problem of vehicles vehicles, according to the Councils, as the railways could withdraw from responsibility once the construction work had been completed.
The panel considers no problem to be the conversions at the' Vor Heubach " and' Vor Kuhbach' railway crossings, for which crossing agreements have already been reached with the railway.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Far te planets, gravitgravity or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects that they intend to launch in the next few years.
Thirty suggestions to choose from, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets in other stars.
No one knows whether there are lives in at least some of them.
The choice is difficult: should we search for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search earth-like planets and thus perhaps discover extra-terrestrial life?
These are precisely the questions that those responsible for the European space Agency Esa are asking themselves.
For their Cosmic Vision programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects, which should make decisive progress in research.
The budget for such L missions is around EUR 1 billion each.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were under discussion, five of which have now in the shortlist.
Many bodies are examining the proposals and hwging the researchers.
A final decision is to be taken by the scientific programme committee in the next few days.
A total of four major questions have been selected by Esa, to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme launched in 2007 2007 will find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact processes of creating stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of the planets orbitthese stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star owns planet, under what circumstances can life created there?
To investigate into this,, Cheops space escescope is due to launched in 2017, which will examine examine 500 500 planknown planetary systems in our immediate vicinity.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger tools, astronomers could map earth-like planets, even analyzing the composition of their atmospheres, thus searching for " biomarkers ": gases seen as an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar work?
This question, too, is ultimately intended to shed light on the conditions that exist for the creation of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as as its particle radiation with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined as examples.
With the Solar Orbiter, the Esa has already approved an M class mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is to start in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
This is why the Esa provides for the first of the three L missions of the " Cosmic Vision " programme.
The probe " Juice " (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected expected to start in 2022.
Eight years later, it reached Jupiter and was to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europa, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
outer space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to examine whether the laws of nature we know about are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also divergences that could show physicists the way to a new theory under whose umbrella all known laws of nature can be united.
How was the universe arise and what is it about?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we are familiar, which consists of stars, planets, and creatures like us, there are dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy y clusters,, darkdark energy whose actions accelerates the expansion of outer space.
So far, researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fraction of the Big BBang in a second, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With' Euclid' the Esa has already approved a M mission here too the which is which be launched by 2020.
A special telescope is intended to the the probe to the the distribution of matter the universe universe throughout entire sky for the first time, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who Could Make the Race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
In the opinion of many experts, the best chances of obtaining an L-L mission have " E-Lisa ", an ambitious concept for proecting gravitational waves.
By this physicists mean changes in the structure of spacetime that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
To date, they not been proved.
Elisa could do that, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission provides for a detector of two or three probes stationed in space.
Unlike plants on Earth, it could also demonstrate the waves of gravity that emerged during the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the emergence of the cosmos.
Four other proposals compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " to explore holes, black things, " Icy Planets ", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, " Prism ", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the Exoplanet Finder, to detect and study earth-like planets.
Proposals for, among other things, sample return transport from Mars, for exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, for solar physics have already disappeared.
Snowden is willing to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblowers, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented by Ströbele to the media in Berlin on Friday, he writes, “ Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissent as a trustbreak and tries to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment in which no defense is possible. ”
But, tell the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the international community ’ s support could persuade the US government to drop the proseccharge against him.
The charges brought by the US Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
The German Minister of the Interior, Hans-Peter Friedrich, told Time online: ‘ If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible ’.
US-Germany relations are burined by claims that the NSA has intercepted German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said that one should take the opportunity opportunity listen to Snowden as a witness if possible, “ without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US. ”
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden, he could unable be return to Russia if he leaves.
When Snowden testifies in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is “ safe, ” the MP said.
Snowden states in his letter that he would be subjected to a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that had driven him out of his home.
But it is toutouched by the global response to “ my act of political expression. ”
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians – including the United States – have have revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden made the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved. ”
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 from passengers wishing to store hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to USD 100 for one piece of hand baggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday stated that passengers should keep the full can.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, and small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said that you can charge USD 25 if the fee is paid in advance and USD 100 to passengers who paid at the boarding gate only.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee is aimed at getting travelers to look for payment in advance.
“ We don't want to calculate this sum, ” she explained.
Airlines began to charge for the first and second piece of checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore put as much into possible into their hand baggage, with the result that the baggage above the seat is often overcrowded.
Fees are one way of getting passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money.
These concerns Frontier's most loyal customers, who would have clearly stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the field above the headquarters.
Passengers buying their tickets on the airline ’ s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry one piece of baggage free of charge at Frontier tier gate, but the next person may have to pay USD 100 for a comparable piece of baggage.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and check-in procedures will be changed so that passengers are aware of the charge before they get to the boarding gate.
Frontier's new hand baggage fee will not enter into force until the summer, no exact date is yet available.
Passengers often abuse about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that transporting the baggage costs cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they so wished.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them, however, have far left the fingers of hand baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded first charges for hand baggage three years ago, later followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely following the additional charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit, the hand baggage fee raise $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines, recently fw with Spirit and was curious about what would expect at the gate if passengers were were with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage fee.
“ The boarding process was among the the smoothest I seen in my career in aviation, ” he said.
I expected to see tooth kneading and tangible discussions at the boarding gate.
“ The plane was full, ” he declared, “ and boarding ran like lubricated. ”
Frontier also follows Spirit in the $2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice were allowed to keep the whole can and would be refplenished free of charge.
Water is still free of charge.
US Airways had briefly tried to charge money for soft drinks in 2008, but undone this seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had followed suit.
Frontiers's move to charge for hand baggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz between $10 and $25 per ticket sold.
This encourages all airlines to get passengers to buy directly from them rather than through an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles was reduced again to 25% of the route.
A flight booked with a third party with Frontier for more than 1000 miles therefore only earn customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve reserve seats when they buy directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver, but but is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenues fell by 9 percent and flight capacity contracunk by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report published on Wednesday by its parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get to grips with Frontier's finances as part of the sale of society.

She called provers such as: wooden eyes are vigilant, as scales fall off the eyes, keep an eye on someone who gives his own when while he sleep, wash his hands of it.
On several occasions, the speaker had her listeners advised what proverb was.
The phrases from the Middle Ages were adopted by the church leader Christel Dehner: all good things are three, make blue, somewhat obscure.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called' bridges to the past'.

Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is been launched at Mecklenburg based Seenplatte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 men and women who already work as unskilled people in the sector are to be qualified as specialists for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
" What is new is that the six-month courses end with degrees, " said Carmen Wiechert of employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are manifold: it would not make the participants unemployed, it would give companies trained professionals who were increasingly absent in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel- und stättenverband (ehehoga (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are also involved in the project.
NSA explains that an “ internal error, ” not hackers, is to blame for the Web site crash.
The shadowy National Security Agency declared on late Friday that a mistake had paralysed its public website for several hours, not hackers, as was claimed online.
“ NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update, ” explained the espionage agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours, and it is unavailable for some users.
Previously, an NSA spokesman had told ABC News that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ comcompromised in any way. ”
Secret information is not in danger, according to the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website will be flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency (No such authority), is now being ed in the bright public eye, is strong criticism following the revelations published in recent months about its extensive in-at home and surveillance program – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the intelligence services fueled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted cycle operation.
The number of people out of a job fell lighslightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the 3.1% quota is better than last year and it is better better in September September " " we would have hoped for more, " says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Director of the Agency for Employment in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far reacted cautiously when hiring.
According to the Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: We have hardly any skilled workers in the crafts, health care and care for the elderly'.
Due to the annual seasons, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been under up since September.
The winter season will in there in mid-December.

Loss of profit in the case of Bombardier following a decrease in delivery and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday after coming under pressure from declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway sector.
Based in Montreal, Bombardier also did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could enter commercially next September in accordance with the ambitious timetable.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago has so far been followed by only three take-ts, which makes doubtful whether the test phase is proceeding as planned.
Results fell short of forecasts, causing a fall of more than eight% of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation on Thursday from outperform to sector in in so that there has limited price potential over the next one or two quarters.
“ Although weaker delivery numbers for aircraft were expected as expected, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector, ” said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft test programme progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries series will be able to catult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and first flew in September, after months of delay.
So far, however, binding orders for CSeries have been moderate at 177, as potential buyers await the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company ’ s claims about fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet aircraft are correct.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
The company also s insassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was on the schedule.
“ The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any longer than expected, ” Beaudoin in at a telephone conference adding adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft ’ s service life.
Each manufacturer is planning differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then to add a revision period, as we have done.
This is done throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, with the rest shortly afterwards, according to company said.
However, analysts remain skeptical about whether, 12 months after the maiden flight, the first customer can put a CSeries aircraft into operation.
Bombardier said that it is review the commissioning plan (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“ The slow progress of the flight test – though it appears to correspond to Bombardian ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015, ” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter, at the end of September 30, Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $147 million, or $cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share the previous earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share remain equal to 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly, falling from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of $0.10 per share and sales of $4.56 billion, says Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims that it has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order book in the aerospace Division on 30 September $32.9 billion, unchanged compared to 31 December.
“ In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our guidelines, but low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing, ” said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace business fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have risen by almost 11% to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport division on September 30 was $32.6 billion, slightly higher compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the area of transport has been affected by settlement problems with some major contracts.
According to the corporate management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trading on Thursday, Bombardi’ s share fell by by 8.% to $4.83 Canadian, after it was also announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette would join the Board of Management.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardian ’ s narrowest rival, reported a 10% decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.

Cocaine addict lawyer who warned drug boss of police investigation must be go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, shared information to underworld size Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer was afraid that his hidden addependence would come to light.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction might be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The criminals hailed as a first first-class ” lawyer nicknamed “ Bash ” was arrested in his house in 2011 after after police oversaw Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug case.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was the Bar Association with colleagues with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests had found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his ets, and on credit cards.
Over an eighmonth period between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin worth of heroin and cocaine, and £200,000 in cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on on to the criminals because he feared that his addiction could be made public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors Office in Blackburn, been found guilty and sentenced at the Liverpool Crown Court, following a week' trial on two charges for hindering justice.
He admitted cocaine ownership in an earlier survey.
The lawyer was convicted after the police discovered in their investigations into Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and placing drugs under the lawyer's dustbin in a 60% purity in a black golf glove.
Shortly after supplying the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephonto Ditta, who was dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
It became known in court that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests had discovered Class A drugs in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but disuted to take cocaine, saying that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that her discussion was subject to “ legal secrecy. ”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and hair hair sample taken taken.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he was running an office at his private address as well as the workplace, and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It became known in court that he had called to important players in drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, following important arrests and informed of what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you do not break the law. ”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has engaged too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker, but of a drug trafficker who drugs his lawyer.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these people.
But that far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue carrying out their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed any misconduct, claiming, “ If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but would do so immediately. ”
But, after the hearing, superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in in ancancashire: “ Mr Ditta has moved from a criminal defender to a criminal moment he began buying drugs from organized criminals. ”
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime, who asked him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must upheld the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed that trust and has tried to hide behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation into Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for owning cocaine and judicial imppediment, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one one can escape the law.
We will find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring guilty conspiplot to in heroin, cocaine and cannababtrafficking.
Thirty-five more involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to a total punishment of 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about which where he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, that his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali, that inequality of opportunity is the motivation for his work.

HHaslach: Skepticism Sws way Condence
The 2015 elections to the 2015 parish council, for example, will change fundamentally fundamental in the lach Haslaunit (SE unit.
There is only one common parish council left for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
There is no need to change the basic decisions of the Diocese and and it is up to parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
During the day it became particularly clear that skepticism about the new is giving way ttantly but increasingly to confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the Souoral Care Team were enough.
Regional Congo Georg Schmitt explained the newly defined guidelines for care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
After that, SE Haslach, as a church community, will in future be a public body that that definto the rights and obligations of the previously six individual church communities.
There will only be one common parish council and a Board of Trustees on which the parish of Kraft Office is represented.
At least two elected members shall be represented from each parish, and in the six parishes so-called community teams shall be formed locally.
Their task in future will be to promote ecclesiastical life in the village.
When the question of the finances of the individual parish, there was then a considerable need for discussion.
The new features require preserving accumulated credits in the parishes for specific purposes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the entire community.
There have been serious concerns, particularly with regard to the major investments investments, the commitment of which will then affect all parishes.
" In the past, too, investments were only made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes on their own, " HasHasch ch parish council Chairman Bruno Prinzbach in relative.
Practical experience with a joint body of five parishes was described by barbarian Ritter, Chairman of the panel in the Schutterwald Neuried minioral Unit.
They set set they set themselves in 2006 of' becoming one, remaining five' and they found that it was not at all easy.
The bodies of the Haslach pastoral Unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams.
The work will be flhed out in further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Souoral care Unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is becoming more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must prepare for higher electricity costs.
As the Managing Director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SUEDKURIER, a four-of four Pfullendorfer family incan additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This levy is redetermined every year in October by the four operators of those of the large electricity routes.
These quantify the additional costs arising from the change of energy, which they can charge by means of a levy over the price of electricity.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Board of directors of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke could inform their customers next week of the exact price increase.
" We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x, " Bias says, with the number being close to the 2 cents.
Traffic traffic lights for permanent red: pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light simply doesn not get green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should we do then - ride with red?
If an affected person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart-based lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad ".
The waiting the, however, be' appropriate', which can be interpreted differently from one case to case.
Becker advises to persist for at least five minutes before any traffic lights malfunction.
However, anyone who continues the journey despite red light must be aware that they are entirely to blame for an accident caused by caused.
Those who tolerate less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warn Becker and point to a decision of the Higher Regional Court Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes of continuous red, a driver ignored the traffic lights and had to answer for a negligent red light breach.
The traffic lights were not broken, but jumped to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the particular situation - but not the fine.
The local Council is pleased with the sound budget
Whenever the budget is discussed in local council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has laulaugh.
The municipal coffery in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not known the administration since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be considered a complete success.
This became clear during the presentation of the annual accounts were presented.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget, at around EUR 7.6 million over EUR 1 million, has been higher than planned.
The surplus in the administrative budget is also around EUR 1 million higher than target, at around EUR 1.8 million.
It surplus mainly due the surplus to higher industrial tax revenues and the local share of income tax.
The wealth budget, too, was well higher than planned planned.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
" This is mainly due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget, " says Rothmund.
Since fewer investments were made in the 2012 financial year than planned, the reserve allocation has also been higher.
Overall, the general reserve has been increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
" Such a work is not simply be shaken out of his sleeve, " Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the local councils were obviously pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that may soon cost citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the community was able to do without high rates of debt in the past.
In turn, according to scaffolding, this has often been cut subsidies from the country.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory sties.
Amongst other things, the towns and municipalities applying for grants must have certain rates of lifting.
" We need to look at the issue of leverage, as investments will be made in the coming years for which we would like to see subsidies, " Gerster announced in this context.

“ The law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it, ” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, including CapitalFM, one of Kenya ’ s most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased, because it is an extension of the government, ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy.
“ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this and send it back to Parliament, ’ he said.

The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following armed Islamists ’ attacks on the West gate shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media incited the authorities ’ anger at publishing recordings of security cameras showing the units deployed to the scene of the crime allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping mall.

By silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they like with impunity.
“ Nobody will ever know, ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation who calls the Kenyan media as a decisive factor in controlling public life.
“ Leaving politicians to their own devices, bankruptting the country and taking us back to the days of hunters and collectors, ” he commented.

Bad-Dürrheim: A Dream comes true for the FC
The official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field did not lose about the importance for the city and the football club, despite the cold weather and rain.
Everyone would have wished a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play be part.

Fifteen years ago, the first thoughts were to solving the problem when consideration was given to building a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the real school on the Salinensee.
Both have been rejected again.
Six years ago, ideas arose to setting up an artificial turf sports ground, which was widely regarded as the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were made two years ago, when the FC took over the cabk room in hereditary lease, pledged a contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and approved the country funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the local council decided to transfer the remaining EUR 356 000 to the total cost of EUR 560 000, combining clumpp.

In the of of visit to the café of the same name name the the in the district district of KleKlein within of the Rhine-Waal University, it does not have to stop at the pure feeling of déjà Vu.
After all, the aim of the cafe, with its beautiful name, is: make make a real stay not only in terms of thought, but also tangible again and experience.
Because it's just fun and simply beautiful.
A glance into the interior at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling immediately.

Here, the team and the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoil the guest with a wide range of coffee or cocktail options.
You can also enjoy delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes.

Maybe Daniel Büttner is not a fan of event evenings for that reason either: " You can't please everyone ".
And with an event I always only address those who are also interested in the special event.
That is why events will be the exception for us.
'We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible ".
This means Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.

UN Prolaims New Objectives in Poverty Reduction
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a number of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals to verty ty Goals announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainon Sustainable Development, began began Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing ancing “ sustainable goals goals ” to the the Development Goals, which expire in 2015.
They have been included in the final draft document to be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests. ”
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agreeing universal, sustainable development goals, ” he said.
“ These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 framework for development.
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the Millennium Development Goals. ”
Even though the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days of the game, mood mood the the ball upper league is remains good.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt at all about that.
Everyone remains fully motivated by this.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
" I certainly don't know how such a victory tastes, " Malmon expects his team to a sense of success at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the Fredenbeck reserve third league reserve has not yet tn out trees, Malmon is raising the finger beforehand.
I still trained many players myself in the A-Youth.
That is why they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
" It also have to wait and see whether there will be any reinforements from the first, " explains the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must increase compared to previous performances.
Above all, there was been a huge lack in in cover work and in the switch game.
The use of opportunities must definitely definitely be improved.
I therefore hope that my players have finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as claslasbetween influential influential figures.
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputa to under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, founder and first President of Mozambique, to agree to calls for peace in a rare public demonstration.
“ We want peace again, we want stability, ” said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
For earing the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt labelled ‘ We call for security ’ in Portuguese and has joined the crowd on the capital ’ s Independence Square on Thursday.
For the weeks now, there have been reports almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, among the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa, in an effort to destabilise the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and natives.
Much is at stake for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of vast gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in investments of more than $50 billion in the coming years years companies like Rio Tinto into, als from Brazil, EEni Italy, and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala ala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group ’ s leader, said Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downdown concerns about instability.
He said to AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a “ loser, ” who “ wants to use all his remaining powers to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government. ”
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo is abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT by this he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously, ” said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to defay the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
“ We have here two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide their heads together, ” says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pressing for electoral reform, has already said that it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a offailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos electoral success has been shrking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçque que MDMDM) founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – who will due resignign when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy.
“ He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he doesn ’ t want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency, ” says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has launched restbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South link.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but is home to Beira, the port, which uses mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded cautiously when asking whether Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique, ” said Mazanga.
Instability has heightened frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, slow progress in development, and a recent wave of abduction.
“ People think that the government and president are responsible for the country ’ s future, and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems, ” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people simply wanted stability.
“ No ody interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again, ” he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ role models for life, ” says one author.
Thstories of Thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks, ” and the artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are “ far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools, ” which is why Crossley Holland advocated a “ careful selection ” of age-appropriate works.
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America, ” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic, ” children would “ completely shut off, ” because entertaining stories convemit the messages “ subliminal. ”
Crossley Holland, which has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Valley, said, “ You can have certain intentions, but it is preferif to keep keep them in the background. ”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or led to a happy ending, but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil.
This must be portrayed in an subliminal way, history reveal history, not explained.
That is the old story of showing rather than telling.

Schrill Piepses rupthers Residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from ships over the stockpile.
The company has several iron in fire at its site.
In addition to coal glucoal port, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind plant logistics.
Cocoal shimmerers black on the storage site in front of the dike.
Spread two massive blue stockk age and return chargers or load the coal as required.
With every movement of the handling equipment, a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
" The signals are for safety purposes and are required by law, " says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
If the wind is unfavourable, this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city order.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with the people concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now about to keep the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
He will continue to relon on open dialogue with its neighbours.
Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal bare imports for power plants and is one of the major players in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the reclining tub in front of the terminal, which is extended to 18.5 metres, capesize bulk carriers can also be handled here for a long time.
" This year we want to crack the 3 million tonne mark in the envelope, " says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the imported coal goes to inland power plants.
If the GDF Suez power plant is put on the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal glue per year will be realistic.
The three unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor line could create up to 10 million.
Bavaria ’ s basketball player, despite his first defeat, is optimistic.

We sent out the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their third appearance in the European premier class, Munich sold sold very well for a long time, but were simply not sufficiently clarified at the decisive stages.
The guests first made the trick of transforming a 15-point lag 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour before Piraeus turned the game again.
" We fought incredibly back against the second Euroleagua Champion, but then made a reckless mistake again, " said Bavarian professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of the Munich players, who celebrated clear victories in the first two matches against the Italian serial master Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the crowd in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay innovation has expanded, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of Caroline ’ s stand-up institution, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“ Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they eventually became known to appear in a club, ” Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year ’ s event will feature appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy charity event for army evetans in the Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of the comedians who will take part in the festival this year have become through through unconventional means, such as programmes on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic slipy fantasy football series “ The League ” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast at both Saturday Night Live and the Parks and Recreation, although she is the best-known for her viral video series “ Marcel the Shell with Shoes On ”.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaumau Bell, focused on racial issues issues, are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the greatest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderhosted a TV show titled “ Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg ” on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in Town Hall in the heart of Manhattan.
“ The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry ’ s entire work, ” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he is here, he sometimes walks through the lanley between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, perhaps I live here.
Iran Satisfacwith the Process of Nuclear Negotiations

" After years, an agreement has been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years, " Foreign Minister Mohamed Javad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
There would still be a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and would also be optimistic that both sides will end up finding a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kying playmdes with Machete
Two children admitted the murder of an 11-year-old old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 year-old boys had invited their victim to hunt birds with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabthe 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well tain, reported El País on Thursday.
Afterthat they would have played football in front of their homes in a working-class quarter.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 km north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the young person who had taken with her was to tt that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the course of the day in front of the police without mentioning any attack on her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
One of the reasons given the older der cited was a rivalry in the football match.
He was provisionally admitted to a psychiatric youth institution.
Pps in Prison
For exploitative trafficking in human beings, pimping, threats, insult and dangerous injury, the District Court Court Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former German soldier, who worked as a door-stand after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial.
In, in five cases, he has met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent on balance against their will after a few weeks.
He used to ed to break with force and threats.
He retains the income of women, some of whom earned for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he banned women ’ s contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated women, he took them to various brothels in the south-west.
He had them monitored there in part in order to control their revenue.
In court, the definitially claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert hinted at serious doubts about mental restraint, and thus about limited ilt ilt the 33 year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The Court no longer had to hear any of the women affected.
As one Kripo official reported, after an initial ad by telephone surveillance, at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking in human beings have been identified.
The talks that were been heard were marked of great aggression.
In later interrogations the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness in which one of the women on the whole body had discovered blue spots has not yet made a statement.
It is' a completely broken person' who sees violence and exploitation as normal in this profession.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
" He has broken away from these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after imprisonment, " he said.
The price of oil continues to give up to USD 96 per barrel

The Court is blocking a decision on the NYPD's stop and-risk policy
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Appeal in the US blocked the appointment of a judge calling for changes to the New York Police Department (“ stop and search ” ((“ stop and search ”) and released the judge from the case.
The 2nd Court of Appeal declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a on's city had been taken.
The judge judged in August that the city was violating the Constitution with the way in which the programme for stopping and consulting people was being implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to help the police amend their directive and training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments for the requested suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge must be dismissed from the event that she breached the Code of Conduct for US judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the semblance of partiality, partly justified on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly publicly to the Court ’ s criticisms.
The judge had ruled that police officers violviolated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people for they unduly targeting black and Latin American men with the stop and-risk programme.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy, training, and supervisory reforms, and ordered a pilot programme with bodborne cameras in quarters where most controls have been carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the ing and addresses of addresses of people disackredundant after police control.
An oral hearing for the vocation of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop and risk tactics have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
Controls of this kind have been in place in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the tenure of non-partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, belonging to all minorities, brought a action, which became a collective redsuit.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop -to-risk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as influence how other police presiidents use the scheme.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morality of the police, but not crime; nor would money be wasted and would to solve the broader problem of a police force that has been under pressure following the removal of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not ending the stop and-risk practice, which is constitutional, but merely reforming the way in which the NYPD implimplements its controls.
The Luckiness of the Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that succeeds in reaching only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association " Helfende HandHände ".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which has already had considerable success.
The first chairman Mr Henne reported extensively on the work of the association.
He himself was first in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed-Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result further cooperation developed and the gynaecologist Henne performed numerous operations on the ground on several journeys.
During the speeches, pictures of the stakes were shown on a screen vas so that the guests of the jubilee event could see the aforementioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former federal border vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed equipping this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and, according to Henne, now plans to play an advisory role with the association.
In 2008, the carpentry Schleeh from Baiersbronn built the sickbay in Socogim, an slums on the outskirts of capital, in record time of less under a week - voluntearily.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the obstetrics clinic in Nagold is to be nationalised.
A is much learned in Africa as a doctor, according to Henne, for example, elerlowing against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not to make as many trips as planned, but many medical cians came to Germany to host in various areas.
In addition, containers of material are regularly sent to Africa, including medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March of this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered abundant local colour by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile brick stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, during their journey to Mauritania.
As his personal motives, he mentioned his work in the field of auditing as a young MEP.
When he realized how much money lost lost the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also emphasized that global economy also demands global love.
Nor is it be borne in mind that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip.
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “ phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip about an affair by then-interior Minister Charles Clarke.
ProsecsecAndrew EdiEdis QC told the Court in the Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser, ” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack and persecute Pawlby ’ s voicemails, but Coulson also called them and left it news news as the Court learned.
“ According to the public prosecutor ’ s office, Coulson, now the editor of the notW, is no one who stands in front of people ’ s homes and hopes to catch them for fresh action, but one who likes to to confront people with a story to see their reaction, ” Edis explained.
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate stories stories: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the second, the monitoring, but there is no other way.
What about the first?
Is he aware of the telephone hacking?
He denies that, but we say, “ And if he knew. ”
Rumors of Clarark’ s affair were first picked up by NotW ’ s feature editor when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said, “ Don ’ t waste your time, it ’ s with Charles. ”
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was seized in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective ’ s computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects. ”
When the research was under way, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, explained Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Pawlby ’ s movements.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: “ I have a story that we want to release tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about. ”
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other key figures, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson had blunkett for an affair with a married woman when he himself lifted with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks refuse to conspired with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted telephone hacking.
Indeed, in protest against the planned Reich tax, French football will go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting is coming to an unwithout results.
In the conflict over the Reich tax, the government and professional football in France have manoeuvred themselves into an impasse following a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of the associations and associations at the Élysée in Paris on Thursday and also listened to their complaints.
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75% levy on income of more than €1 million per year, which all firms in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side has also remained firm.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be through, according to Jean-Pierre Louvel, head of the Association of Professional Clubs Clubs (UCPF).
The matches in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 scheduled between th November and 2 December are therefore cancelled.
Gechingen: No absolute Protection Possible
" We want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning stage " " mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens c information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the Municipal Hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and submit ideas.
He made it clear:' final decisions shall be taken by the members of the local council'.
The floods that Gechingen hit unprepared on 15 May 2009 were a dramatic event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, according to Häußler.
A river basin investigation had been commissioned with the neighbouring community of AIDS, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
" The protection of as many cultivated plots as possible is the goal, " says Häußler.
The foundation is given to the planning of flooding, which are statistically expected every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In experts, this is called " HQ 100aClimate ".
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1 00-year flood.
" There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve relative improvement, " says Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100a climate, around 4 million euros have to be invested in in echingen, with the municipality anticipon national subsidies of around 70%.
However, Häußler pointed out that funding can only be provided if an overall concept is implemented.
For this, the community needs the participation of the citizens.
An elabororious planning and authorisation procedure must be completed.
At best, implementation ation can begin in 2016.
Among other things, the concept of protection, which was already presented to the local council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the influlow of the river Irm from the Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Amongst other things, questions have been asked as to why more dams and reservoirs are not planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner from the commissioned engineering firm Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needs the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired objective overall.
In addition, it is necessary to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Forest Forest CorCorbe.
There was resentment among those living dering the Algate, who, even with normal thunderstorms, repeatedly suffer from overload of the channel network.
The problem is well known in administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for canal systems are different than for flood prevention and that this should not be confused.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way as to cope with with two to three years of rain events.
Larasing the sesechannels would devour millions.
Seriwoinjured after Clisions
On early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a head-on collision on the state road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police closed the road completely, but were unable to say much about the accident at first.
However, there are various testimony that should first be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old steker of a VW Golf travve towards Revensdorf and that the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
The two vehicles collided, with the woman so heavily trapped that it took the fire brigade barely half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The real cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
Both injured came to nearby hospitals.
The track was closed for about two hours.
He could be called the stoyevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a God seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and narratives also have something serious.
Amazling the kinship in the exterior: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoevsky is to be understood with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, one reads reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet who is true at home.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with its 118 narratives distributes Zweithousand.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, obsession with security, and the belief that he been chosen.
Dick had divine God, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, had added drugs to his brain.
He realised, early on, that the computers are divin.
He wrote a computer theology and asking what distinguishes a human being from a machine, the Creator from his creation.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The " Minority Report " dates back to 1956 and exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
The principle of " pre-crime ", " pre-crime ", is being developed here, which is what has become more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Thick's world, which alarmalarmresembles ours, mutants looking to the future - and the police are gaining out.
" We grend individuals who have not broken any law, " says the head of the authority.
'We grab them even before they can commit a violent crime'.
And: " In our society there are no serious criminals, but we have a criminal centre full of pesudo criminals ".
They assume that the worst will happen and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Thick ’ s narrative looks like the blueprint for the anti-terrorist laws and the NSA ’ s eavesdropping.
Anticipating the attack: that is how Obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice work.
But Thick ’ s story is not over.
The head of police complains that there is no longer a separation of powers, that the military controls everyday life - and what remains of the state.
Then the monitor himself will be monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system rotates through.
It is perfect, but it lies.
It invents its own preconditions.
Not only do errors and victims accept in, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it combats.
Read Philip K. Dick means always constantly getting closer to the truth.
The ate ate to testify Merkel in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the late case of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Attor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in Russia in person, reported the agency Interfax.
Previously, member of the Green federal ag Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations are intensiforcing corporate paranoia because of state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On the orders of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Interior Intelligence Service, he should photograph the umbrella of the US Foreign Office, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the USA and the German State Department in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US did not use any of foreign espionage “ “ stesteal trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profits. ”
But since Edward Snowden, the former employee member became whistleblowers, began publishing his fillings of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders have no longer been sure whether they can take the director at their word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency spspon Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought paranoia to a new high for government surveillance.
The camel ’ s back caused the revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone was been urred, perhaps for ten decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then management are certainly potential objectives.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“ Germany must wake up, ” explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US is now almost as great a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such a survey published in July by EY.
But Snowden ’ s documents leaked have provided no evidence that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and that it should reduce its dependence on the US.
Businesses companies are sceptical about this.
It has been suggested in the Bundestag that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and reopen them slowly...
“ That is not how it works, ” says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If we had wanted a strong European IT industry, they should not have been allowed to die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except except the IT industry.
Yet the reach and technical refinement of US spying authorities exposed by Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China.
A major change is happening in cloud computing, because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurisdiction there there and therefore therefore potentially risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, following revelations about US data mining activities at Prism, about 10% of non-US-based members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy CEO of SAP, says, “ We see a new question from customers that did not exist a year ago – it is: where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that they will physiphysically this area of law? ”
Many German business leaders argue that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore must therefore be guarded at all costs.
It is no surprise that industrial espionage is taking place.
This has always been the case.
“ It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed with the current discussion, ” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate governance does not usually boast about the countermeasures that has been taken, because that benefits attackers.
Large ge-companies have long told people that it is not advisable to take a free USB stick at a trade fair or leave a laptop unattended in the hotel room, to put it mildly.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the Board of Management of car manufacturer Audi, says that it has been part of the practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as eavcpping devices.
Germany ’ s BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
“ Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorised access, ” warns the BVT in a report.
The US warns its own companies against industrial espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February placed France, Russia, and Israel second behind China in two of the countries used to obtain economic data for hacking.
A member of the board of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then “ the French are the worst. ”
Bernard Squarcini, a former head of France ’ s DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month saying: “ The intelligence services know very well that even if all countries work together in the fight against terror, they spy on their allies. ”
Hechingen: Messe provides answers to wedding questions.
" Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery man can undertake, " said the philosopher choen Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding can be successful were given by a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Important providers around a wedding were represented.
One trend: the retro look has been appeared.
This starts, for example, with the wedding clothes.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In the front, the often ruulurated emembroiy clothes are closed, often with a veil, but at the back they go down the back and often end up in a tow.
However, the spirits are vorce, as Stefanie Koch of the Modehaus Kleidermüller emphasizes.
In men, the suit with waistcoat and plastron dominates, but cream or brown combinations can also be chosen.
Important is the selection of the, has been explained.

Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teenager ’ s parents, whose body was found in a rolled Ringermat in his high school ggym, are convinced that their son has been murdered, said the family ’ s lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, USA, was found on January 11 in a upright mat behind the gallery in the SCulture Hall.
The Sheriff investigators of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, doubdoubted the 17-year-old ’ s family.
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered, ” explained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
They would never have thought he died in the way the sheriff concluded.
“ They believe that is no logic in violating the laws of physics as well as common sense, ” Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be covered up in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“ Her son went to school to learn and came back in a body bag, ” he comments.
US Treassecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into Johnson ’ s death, because a number of important questions remain not been resolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
That is what Moore explained at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, in whatever direction they lead.
My aim is to find out the truth.
“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation, ” he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy meant that Johnson died as a result of “ position-driven suffocation. ”
But a second autopsy had caused another cause of death, according to arguore.
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed, ” he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson ’ s death, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff Authority was not immediately prepared to comment at our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to to release all the surveillance videos inspected by the investigators.
The teenager ’ s parents said they hoped that the video recordings would show indicate how he died.
CDC Publish Allergic delines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for the handling of children's food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines to issued by the US government, as the number of children subject to school with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among faculty and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin in stock – EpiPen car injection is most commonly used – to counter a potentially lethal hypersensitivity reaction.
State legislators have recently amended rules to enable schools to keep Epinephrin in stock more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, ‘ It feels like something is pressing on my tongue ’, ‘ My tongue feels like a hair is on it ’ or ‘ My tongue craingling ’.
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ Gender indeterminate ”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with ambiguous genitals.
Newborn babies are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender gender such such children, but may indicate indetermindeterminate ’ or ‘ unstipulated ’ on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to remove pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding operations for allocing gender among newborn babies and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
One intersexual person said, according to the BBC years later, “ I am neither man nor woman. ”
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutiland full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is born every year as either boys nor girls.
They belong to the intersexual, a group diagnosed with as Sexsexual differentiation Disorder ” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles), or unusually developed genitals.
Valais Simpson was perhaps intersexual.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most US experts recommend that the best available information be used to assign gender if a provision is not possible, rather than wait for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding for surgery, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “ sounds like a good cause. ”
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention, but most children they do not, ” he said.
You can assign a gender without an operation and then wait and see how identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity at all are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it is happening.
It is like the secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission stated that intersexual people must be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defines both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them.
These characteristics were reflected in in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hairs, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosomstructures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in working life, as well as of the level of harassment, violence and prejudicrime.
Young inconsistent with the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female, or “ third sex ” on official documents.
In June, Australians s Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ genderless ” person, after a court granted a “ undefined ” gender status for their life.
In addition to M and W, German identity cards will in future have a third allocation, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according a reported in France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to “ gender theory ” to be removed from school books.
The US website Catholic Online has also opposed German law on the grounds that “ if the world is dragged into a new state where gender gender a choice, but sexual activity activity not, we ort two other pillars of civilization. ”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Baby Zone that she would better babies to be assigned a sex at birth.
“ Being a parent is already stressful enough even without further restrictions, especially if you don ’ t know your child ’ s sex, ” she said the parents ’ website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sex parts have been called hermaphrodites after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Only ten years ago, medicine regarded the gender as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being doubt question, now that we know how complex gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex they assign.
“ In the mid-twentieth century, this was was called a “ psychiatric emergency, ” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, the was not the psychichirist who was called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of treating children with ambiguous genitals stems from Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender was formable.
He coined the term “ gender identity, ” arguing that social and environmental impulses – as parents educup a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones, coining whether a person considers himself male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “ John / Joan, ” his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated during a botched circumcision to castrthe the child and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion, which it was not, ” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990 ’ s, with the Internet of the Internet, vors vors of these genually operations became public that were “ unhappy with the outcome. ”
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genital.
Doctors were not clear whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis, were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“ I knew I was not a girl, ” he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should be given a vaginal plastic.
But, been depressed and knowing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical files.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilised when I was born – and nobody ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals.
After learning the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation has made it infertile.
Today he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to ensure that intersexual people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of CaliforCalifora-based Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that German law may “ encourage standing and stigmatisation. ”
“ Many activists worry that Germany German decision could may parents to make quick decisions and algn “ “ not fixed, ” the child, ” she declared.
We fear that favencourages intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait for.
But we do not yet know what effect the law will have, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law because “ it allows adults to be recognized as the third sex. ”
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender, ” she explained.
German law is about assignbution at birth.
This is not a fight to which young children to to forced at this stage.
Once they are up, they can decide on their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast diologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law “ empowers ” both parents and children.
Katie, daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Due to the receptor fective of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatc c.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“ The law gives room for parents, so they don t have to rush into decisions, ” Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do various tests and sort things out, thus giving them time before writing “ male ” or “ female. ”
In this way, everything is fine – you pull up up the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy parental happiness.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that can no longer be undone.
“ This includes children in the decision and remoates the fear that ros parents for believing they are not doing the right thing, ” she explained.
In the end, it is the child who decides on the gender that suits him better – and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to decide for choices.
Unknown injure Girls by Soting out the Car
Unknown people injinjured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt during shots from a car.
The perpetrators of Genthin GenGenhad probably fired an air pressure weapon at a group of children on Thursday evening.
The police in Burg told this this.
The girl had been slightly injured on the left calade.
Rescue workers took the girl to hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses watseen two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke down.
They then drove them away.
The criminal police criminal police, they investigated on Friday.
To date, the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet halloween night.
Officials were only called twice to children to be thrown, throwing them against house facades.
Since the house owners recognized this in good time and removed the egg residues immediately, no material damage should probably have been caused.
Furthermore, some New Year ’ s Eve bulets have probably been lit in the city area, but no material damage has been done here either.
A resident in the Bishop Friendor's Pil reported that his car was wrapped with knoop paper and his raclist apertures were stolen.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found found his cyclist aphtures in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to take any action.
Living with a future perspective
Actually Waltraud Ries lives wonderdream.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of greenery, an old tree population, nice neighbours and not too much traffic.
It is only a few minutes by public transport from the city.
" Hopefully you are not afraid of spiders? " asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new flat for my husband and me for some time.
However, you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern that no not be able to cope master the many steps to the house and the home in old age, she explains.
Moreover, since a meniscus operation, the the fiffifties has experienced first-hand what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicaps.
She recently published a book on the subject'' Happily in old age - which form of housing is the best for me?'
'Our flat is the best example of what is not even possible in old age,' she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the duplex apartment more than 20 years ago, it was simply a beautiful apartment immersed in greenery.
Today, at the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
She also knows, however, that she is one of the few people to deal with the issue of' housing in old age.
Most people displace out as long as possible.
Old always become only the others, " she says smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great will we worry.
'Then it can be too late,' Ries es.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined housing in old age.
" But which form of residence you choose is always an individual decision, " she explains.
D i e solution is not available for age.
Even those who can afford retirement retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they might also fall ill.
And:' Without a good knowledge of the national language, you can also unite in Dolce Vita,' the author of the specialized book gives permission to resgrate.
Among their models you will find classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the frequently cited pensioner ers.
In old age, everyone has their own ticks and cks.
'For me, such a a shared flat not be nothing,' she says a wink of an eye.
Certainly not like a student dorbathroom with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
" In old age, you simply need your retreat rooms,' says Ries.
The author of the book does not want to exclude that a community of senior citizens can still work.
But this must be different from that in the classic student secondary A.
And sometimes you just want one's calm, " she believes.
She is not alone in this opinion, at least in the capital's capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own homes as long as they can,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the civic service life at the age of the capital of capital.
Your office advises people on the topic of' becoming older'.
That is why older people in particular would often accept inconveniences and restrictions only to be able to stay in their familiar environment, and that is also the experience of the Foundation WarentTest.
Today, there are many possibilities to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who are involved in the age reconstruction of their house or flat to obtain thorough information first and not to hire the first best craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental flat, one or two things can be realized, and if it is only the increase in toilet seats, the interior designer clarifies matters.
But it is not always possible to transform design the existing flat according to the age and thus without barriers, however beautiful it may be.
Waltraud Ries had to experience this experience.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, which would also be paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the much greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, she horrified more than before the spider at her home door.
The US WWant to to ute ute Snowden
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence official Edward Snowden.
He continues to be accused of passing passed ununauthorised secret information.
So he has to face criminal proceedings in the US, said State State spokesperson Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Nor would Snowden statements by Snowden change that.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the US to to continue to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that current statements were those of a Member of parliament, not those of a German member of the government.
Intelligence service lellers Edward Snowden is generally ready to talk to German authorities.
First of all, however, he wants his to be clarified.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the US in an unaddressed letter that Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the federal government, the Bundestag, and general federal lawyer.
According to a translation circulated by current, the letter has the following wording:
To the Compporents
I have been asked to write to you concerning your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and used to be contracted or direct employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
While working in these institutions, I have witnessed systematic violations of the government's my law, which led me to act through moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I have been subjected to serious and persistent incitement that forcing me to leave my family and my home.
I live live in exile and enjoy the temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of comprehensive surveillance that is accountable to no one as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at previously covert abuse of public confidence.
The benefits to society from these insights are becoming increasingly clear and, at the same time, the risks taken have been significantly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a truof loyalty and seeks to criminalise and prosect political expression.
Nevertheless, to tell the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this deplniable attitude.
I hope that, once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in sibly sibly clarifying the facts regarding what is said in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and lawfully.
I look forward to a meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation has been clarified and I thank you for your efforts to respect the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies fies by Hans-Christian Ströbele.

Report: Obama campaign thought considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers secreconsidered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 campaign, according to The New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 campaign, Double Down: Game Change 2012. ”
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, which reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had held “ extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011, ” find out whether it looks better for Obama ’ ’ dwindling hope of re-election if he drop bedes.
According to Jonathan Martin, The Times ’ s national correspondent, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of senior campaign and White House staff, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact on poll values to exchange former Secretary of State Clinton for Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly kept secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley, Obama ’ s former campaign leader, Jim Messina, and former White House chief advisers, David Axelrod, and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change.
Double down claims that Daley had been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden, despite their “ close personal personal, ” before before finally ting against such a move, after data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances. ”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“ I said a whole range of things to consider, and that was one of them, ” Daley explained to the magazine.
It is important to remember that the President had terrible survey figures at the time, so we thought, ‘ For God ’ s sake, what are we doing? ’
While Daley described the investigations as “ due diligence, ” Martin told CNN ’ s Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a move would paying off at the ballot box.
“ There ’ t t much money is spent spent on surveys focus focus groups in campaigns unless you think seriously about something, ” Martin explained on AC360.
But it is not clear whether Obama knew his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential change.
Although Daley declared that he did not think the president was “ aware ” of the possible change, the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was “ possible ” for Obama to know about it.
Martin added that double down did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political explorations of Obama ’ s reached reached.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was unaware about the investigation into whether bedes should be dropped in the election.
“ Possible, ” Martin replied.
What will happen to my address on the way?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Has the design of the Internet service e-mail been technically implemented in the of the e-mail service, to the traditional mail?
In the conception of early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
That is why the basic technical protocols have not taken attention to creating a solid foundation for the exchange of letters that is safe.
As a result, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user sends a mail " Anna " to " Benni ", are the computers of the two directly connected?
Anna's e-mail program or browser will first send the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if you has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni is using.
On the route, the mail can run via many other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can call the content from his provider.
Are conventional e-mails be read on their way through the net?
Most mails mails be read several times by software robots along the way.
For the sender's provider, it is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
Provider also check whether it is a annoying and unsolicited spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have any more task?
On systems such as GMail, the robot also calculects the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate by GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can provide appropriate links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading a mail is low.
In theory, however, this can be done.
In companies administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mails.
The law enforcement authorities and the secret services also have legal means to intercept or receive e-mails.
There are also there possible illegal spspying.
Is it possible to protect emails against reading?
Encryption according to the OpenPGP standard can effectively encrypt an email against reading.
With a lot of technical effort, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even easy to identify who communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the e-mail market in Germany?
Among the mainly privately used mailboxes, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role role, according to an investigation by Convios Consulting in August 2013.
While Yahoo-Mail ’ s shares had recently fallen, GMail from Google has increased significantly.
Mother locked red in the forest and receives a pension
When his aged mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and care benefits.
In order to be able to continue to pension pension and benefits, a 67-year-old Wolfsburg buried his dead mother in the forest following police investigations.
First, he covered up the deaths of the 89-year-olds, and then he collected the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old is answer for fraud, as one spokesman said on Friday.
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected as early as May: at that time it was striking that the dependent mother mother no longer longer needed medicines.
The pensionator told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to officials, they found it further.
It emerged that the two had lived in a common home for more than 15 years and that he had last cared for it.
Finally, the 67-year-old admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an subsidid no evidence evidence of a capital crime.
Feel like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first bright ice in the dark using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine life and created a gtreat out of it.
He came the idea after reading research into jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to produce the luminous protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, the pH value in the protein and triggering the luminaire.
Chris explains that the ice cream react to the warmth in your mouth and shines – so the more you lick, the briter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, says: “ The product is unbelievable, but still in a very early production phase, so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds. ”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH rises and the ice shup.
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to us to launch it on Halloween, because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever produced, because the alellum is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about £140.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, famous for for unusual unusual ours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, ‘ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream ’.
This is in itself impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals als make up ice cream cream but but suspect suspect we find a way to do it.
The cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by by Chinese scientists
After six days of play, TSV Morsum is still una point in the Association Handball League.
It is precisely now that the team of Ingo Ehlers will face the derby against TSV Daverden tomorrow, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts again for us.
" I hope that will finally have our head free, " Ehlers is cautiously optimistic.
With the exception of the permanently wounded Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his complete board at his disposal.
Like us, Daverden is relies on speed play.
We must therefore keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, we need to increase the level of cover, which has recently left a far but certain impression.
Daverden ’ s coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course course a house number.
But that is why we are far from being the favorite, because everything can always happen in the derby.
However, Panitz now wants to add up in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be absent.
This is why the A-boy Joost Windßuß, who is active with a double right to play at the A-Youth Bundesliga HC Bremen, is celebrating his season debut.
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Figures
When I was small, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and disguise us for the neighbourhood.
Today I have become a halloween muffler.
Over the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home, and I will probably probably do so this year either.
But, according to the statistics, I am a black sheep as regards Halloween.
The majority of Americans – $158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and decorations, says the US Retailers Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every time Halloween is the trend values.
Costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate items are the last cry.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothing, they can now also body seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead and I bet the Dafpunk space singners will make it into the instagrram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my surprise, were not alone.
Indeed, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of ‘ hot dogs. ”
With regard to sweets, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, says The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, slippers, candies and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Department of Commerce, who travel through the neighborhoods saying “ sweetness or sour. ”
In fact, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and, let us decude ourselves – eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is sugar-sweet CandCorn, yet 15 million kilograms of them are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweectionery manufacturers.
That is about nine billion grains of man.
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses in which it spits.
They have great names such as ‘ Terror Behind the Walls ’ (which is in real real prison), ‘ Howl-O-Scream ’ and ‘ The House of Shock ’.
Indeed, there are 1,200 officially recognised spuHhouses in the United States that are earning 500 500 in revenue, according to America Haunts, including the wonderful photos on which you pee into your pusers and then put friends on Facebook, where you won ’ t get rid of them again, and then the guy you ’ re on with leave a comment like “ nice facial expression. ”
But let us finally come to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and carving a pumpkin lamp is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from a very young age.
Fortunately, the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend only began last year, thanks to pinterest, so most of us grew up carcarving the pumpkin together, not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin seeds, which is slowly rotting in the front garden, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score right, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something nice from their 921 kg pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmbrecht: Rescue rescue charred corbodies
The fire brigade had to leave to Helmbrechts on late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches the night to Friday fire.
The rescue services have a charred body out of the house.
Rescue workers found a charred body in a three-family house in case of a fire in Helmbrecht.
Whether a inhabitant is not yet unclear, as one police spokesman said in Bayreusaid.
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already out of a window.
The emergency forces went into the flat and found the body in a room.
This and another room were completely fire.
The entire ground floor has been damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
For the time being, the building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany ’ s largest state church has an offensive charter to promote the profession of pastor.
Background is a possible lack of parishes: the Evangelic-Lutheran Landeskirche Hannover expects that the number of currently around 1,800 pastors to be halved by 2030 according to the current situation.
For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily routine for yourself.
For the first time, the National Church commissioned a pastpastor with castles on a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study theology after graduaccalaureate.
Bures attributes this to the process of de-ecasisation: " God's voice is quiet, the world is loud ".
The profession here is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my calendar and I can focus my priorities where important to me.
Pastors, as pastors, could be very close to humans.
They earned as much as teachers and could could make living from it.
True, more will be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer.
This suits today ’ s young people, who are concerned not only with careers, but also with inner-filled work.
According to the State Church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors currently retire every year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a study of theology start their victariat.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas, such as the resin, Emsland or endland, it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Among other things, castles want to organise study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology is broad education.
You can even become a president of Germany.

Fire brigade called to save a bitch strpped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock cky montory in a quarry.
Cockerspaniel bitRuRuhad ran away after a minor road accident.
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her predicament.
Fire fighters took down on the rock face and saved the dog from certain death
The fire brigade succeeded in bringing a bitch to safety that was stuck on a 15-metre high lead in a rock wall.
The nine-month old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby ran away after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone for three before before being saved from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 to whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and thank West YorYorshire Fire and Rescue Service re-fighters.
They had desperately looked for her missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when she died after the small road accident in the quarry.
At about 14: 15 on Wednesday, a walker carrying out his dog, watthe strstrRuby by on the 15-metre high helet in the quarry.
The technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed the spot and ed down to save Ruby, which was then transported upwards in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said, “ She was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the rock face – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her salvation – she was like stiff frozen.
But now it is doing well.
She then eaten a few dog cakes.
That was quite an unusual task.
The fact that the dog has been discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, the specialist in the technical rescue team, said, “ Ruby had a huge fortunluck. ”
There was a possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but he found nothing other than exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “ Watwatch the rescue was frightening. ”
I could not believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them in their arms.
The veterinarian said that if exhaustion had become too great and collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The fire fighters have done a great job.
What they have done was really courageous.
We are simply so grateful and each one of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “ We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up. ”
The fire fighters were great.
I can hardly believe where it was.
Mick Jagger explains that he never higed Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the Pop star said she had worked as a background singer on Jagger ’ s 2004 song “ Old Habits Die Hard ”.
Perry said that she had dinner with the Altrocker, and that “ he begged me when I was 18. ”
She added, “ That was a long time ago, and he was very nice to me. ”
In a statement, one JagJag’ s representative, 70, said on Thursday that he “ categorically ies that he had ever sought an approach with Katy Perry. ”
The representative added, “ She may have confused him with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at this year ’ s Rolling-Stones tour.
Their new album “ Prism ” was immediately ked number 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European Unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new story of terror to independence.
This time we are being warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This is the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the Hadrian Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the possible economic benefits that of increase freedom to travel throughout the rest of Europe, but this was not feature in the headlines, as expected.
Nor has any one mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it more advantageable to them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continuing disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in exchange for what we really want from the Scots.
So not really a story.
And one that has come so important over the years that it already resembles a fossil: for the first time, I heard ‘ independence means passport control ’ duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is being lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why expect an independent Scotland expected to dance to the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for Brussels Brussels, especially now?
That is the real European news: the great post-war-war plan to unify Europe has stalled.
The European project has officially died with the euro crisis.
Across the EU, parties are gaining ground that are anti-EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to win almost five million votes in the September s federal election, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
But the current economic crisis is proving to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket into which the national economies are forced by holding to the single currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro ’ s crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was the only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pegged its members at exchange rates that beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to leave.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis vis Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European problem of productivity.
As a result of the “ green ” energy guidelines imposed by Brussels – a code for subsididisFrench and German energy companies companies at expense expense consumers consumers European industry is pays twice as much for electricity and four times for gas as as the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage roll in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being marginalised by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is rising, especially in France, the EU ’ s former cheerleader.
After the war, France ’ s political elite saw the EU EU a a vehicle for containing Germany and raising Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has its own economic economic, which is what the battered French economy struggling with.
The result: Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing, anti-EU EU Front Front just just won a post-election election, the ruling socialists in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that right-wing divide will automatically benefit the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newfound popularity among white working-class French?
It wants to use next year's EU EU elections to forge an anti-EU, anti-currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is perfectly possible – then such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
This is the point to would like want to up: in the not too distant future, growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the “ Europe of (sovereign) nations ” favorGeneral de General favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold stuck to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the United States.
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately the) Less-England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can put up where.
I suspect Scotland could do very well in a looser European grouping if we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same and maintaining our economic independence.
Remarkably, the SNP government in Scotland is the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe, and won a spectacular majority in 2011, rejecting the proposed (and made) cuts, for which Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem-coalition were to able.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now only to get impose austerity policies from Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Becting grown Up Quicker
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach adolescence rather than their white peers, as research shows.
Physical Changes does not mean directly mean adolescence
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that epidemic obesity trigers early adolescence.
The trend towards early adolescence is less severe among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialized in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried when her daughter grows breasts and shamhair at the age of seven or eight?
At this week ’ annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endococrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no sign that puberty is occurring quickly, ” explained Kapwiwitz.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, shame and armpits hair, as well as body od, can be seen in girls earlier.
However, there has only been a slight shift in the age of the menarche (occurrence of the first bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“ When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years until the menarche, ” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “ Early Puberty in Girls: The essential counselor for dealing with this frequently occurring problem. ”
Time is the closest test of how puberty progresses.
There is debatabout what is indeed the beginning of adolescence, but it is ‘ ‘ mature ’ for breast enlargement to be accompanied by a surge in growth of eight years ago.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
With faster progress, tests by an endironologist may be displayed to eliminate serious problems such as tumours or cyysts.
There are treatments for delaying early menstruation and repaveranother consequence consequence: premature aging aging, which can ultimately lead to slowment ing growth and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, the speed of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication, but he admits: “ Suppressing adolescence can alleviate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings of being different from their peers. ”
The other major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side, ” said Kaplowitz.
“ It was a shock, ” remembers a woman whose daughter got her days days at ten.
Although there were the first signs and we had talking about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many extensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones would be caused in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls in the past, come to adolescence.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the obesity epidemic.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 of girls aged between six and nine, establishing a between body fat fat and adpuberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that have played.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early adolescence seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have grown facface and shame hair before, the trend towards full-previous adolescty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and shamhair is widespread even among babies and toddlers.
" We need to be careful about identifying the the true set set adolescence, ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their atrician cian advice on how to talk to their child.
“ This can mean that you have to have a conversation sooner than expected, ” says Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs sooner than expected.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over the width of seats in the face of large orders.
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers about the breadth of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, which sets the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The argument revolves around the width of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines strive the most, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
This week, Airbus called for an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the archrival val eing eing that it is for the airlines to decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competcompeting to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-distance l ots and are awaiting record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How back of the aircraft is designed – particularly whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial for the economic economic results that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design is supposed to deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernised “ 777X ” has 406 people in tourist class seats that are more than 17 inches wide and allowing for ten per row.
Airbus states that the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 people in 18 inch seats in the tourist class, out of nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share lessons about technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Airbus is now appeing directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to complete the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could mark the start of a new ad war, showing donors a picture of three people squeezed in a restaurant, with the title: “ Would you accept that? ”
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats rower than regional turbo bo ps, ” says Airbus Sales Director John Leahy.
As dietary habits change, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970 ’ s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance travel, and by the end of the century, the weight of the average male American increased by 10% aged 40-49, according to the US Department of Health data.
According to US health statistics, the waist size of the average male American in the twenty-first century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that its rival adheres to a 1950s seating concept, when the average volume of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies has been carried out to show that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing denies Airbus ’ figures on the size of the seats and says that it is not to the manufacturers of manufacturers to decide how airlines strike the balance between air fares and facilities.
The company also declares that, according to research, the experience on the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
‘ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility to do what they believe they need in order to succeed, ’ explains Boeing ’ s cabin expert Kent Craver.
They do not want us to dictate them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
It is about more elbow freedom for passengers, but it is increasingly an issue for manufacturers that can have an impact on turnover.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least USD 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a major impact on the US or European export record.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to be 20% more efficient per headquarters in their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 35-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
The 77Boeing's statements results partly depend on the 777X, with its ten seats per series, with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than those of currently used machines with 10 seats per row.
“ Boeing therefore sques more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products, ” says Kevin Keniston, Head of PassComfort at at European Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for a ghter arrangement, which could accompanied by cheaper fares.
“ Eighteen inches of seats would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of of, Airbus ’ s range is driven by the 777 threat, ” says Mary Kirby, expert in cabin facilities, founder, and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world ’ s travelling jet sellers even carry their yto cks to measure the institution in the competition.
Even if they promote comfort, all manufacturers manufacturers also offer highly condensed jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a ten-seater A350, but says that it has not yet sold one.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of greater cabin adaptability and offered wide isor seats for some aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that calls for a new industry standard are likely to vanporate, but could distract attention from the wave of 777X sales.
A New Anti-nicotine vaccine could destroy the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could to protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further experiments are needed before human testing, which can take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good.
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to quit trying out all the methods available on the market, but have seen that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches, ” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells that then produce a permanent stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt down the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice administwere given nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
By contrast, mice without vaccination would have taken a time out, ” researchers declared, a sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccinines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often in order to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, by turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if safe, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
It is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“ They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them rid of their habit, ” he explains.
British scientists have said that the results are interesting, but at the same time warned that further research is needed.
Tripodi dendenied to have been influenced by Obeid
An investigation is being launched against the former Minister of the atory Party, Joe Tripodi of New South Wales, by the state corruption body.
The former NSW minister denies that he had amended the maritime lease rules at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had covert holdings in three land in state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigations into whether Obeid influenced various state ministers to extend lease contracts at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without tender after they expired in August 2005.
Now we are being investigated on the charge that Tripodi knew of Obeid ’ s hidden interest in land after Tripodi ’ s former Deputy Chief of Lynne Ashpole testified on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for lease contracts.
The tenants were opposed to this and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies on the Circular Quay, which contributed $2.5 million annually to the Obeids, were renewed without public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Port from February 2006 to November 2009, originally declared out in favour of public tenders.
But he denied to make the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a transformation of the government ’ s lease rules.
A telephone letter submitted to the ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who moved to the Ministry of Port after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
“ Was the issue raised in these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease arrangements? ” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“ No ” replied Tripodi.
I cannot remember what was discussed, but it definitely was not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter are attacking targets in targets, official sources sources say
Israeli fighter planes would have attacked a target in Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a senior official told Fox News.
The official did not explain what the objective was, but said that it was at least one thing.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already launched air strikes on rocket supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 47 visas could be subjected to “ authenticity tests ”
The government is considering a “ authenticity test ” for 447-visa foreign workers as part of enhanced measures.
If the test were to be introduced, it would be used on a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for bringing family and friends into Australia.
A government proposal for discussion was published today, the former laboratory depP Maxine McKew condemcondemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers, they could be perceived as an insult by Australia ’ s neighbors.
“ Loud statements like “ foreigners should stand back, ” and “ Australians hire first, ” are a very unpleasant relapse in times when unions are demanding a protected labor market, ” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this has meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region steed an echo of this historic artifact, that would not surprise me.
The proposal for a discussion outlines 12 measures once devised by former immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who visited Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on smuggling in human beings, has implemented five of the recommended amendments and the others are being considered.
If the ‘ authenticity ’ criterion is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked to see whether ‘ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally associated with the holder or relevant person of the supporting company ’.
Firms could also be obliged to account for the number of 447 visa holders after, in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually stopped hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died from a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island by refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father ’ s death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study has announced by the British Government to increase the benefits for Scotland of the HS2 rail project.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to establish high-speed links between Scotland and North North of England from the very beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the ‘ ‘ will bring Britain closer together ’.
The Scottish Minister for Transport, Keith Brown, has said that he is very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed Highit between London and Northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for northern England and Scotland.
These include the possibility of a travel journey of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: ‘ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route that brings the Britain and its cities closer together ’.
We are moving sing with HS2 because it has enormous advantages.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented, “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland. ”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to make a ‘ unequivocal vocal commitment to Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said, “ The high-speed rail link has enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time, Scotland ’ s economic power also provides an argument for fast rail links across the UK. ”
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that will benefit everyone and complement complement the Glasgoow-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British ministers next year and deciding on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Australian passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to ease the rules on such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read, watch, or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases if they are in “ flight mode. ”
Passengers are already allowed to do so during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books on take-off and landing.
Australian companies are monitoring the decision that US US airlines will have an enormous amount of work to implement, but do not have immediate plans to change their rules.
The Air TraffControl Authority (CASA) also stated that the announcement would be looked at, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases remain in Australia.
“ CASA does not currently have any specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft, ” stated.
The issue is governed by provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held discussions with CASA about extending the use of his WiFi entertainment system on flights and said that he is open to change, but that need to be initiated by the legislature.
“ We would welcome a review of CASA ’ s of electronic devices, because because we are that that would improve improve customer ’ s experience after offering (wireless entertainment) during the flight, ” said one spokesman.
Qantas said that we would stick to the current rules for the time being.
“ Our current guidelines stipulate electronic electronic equipment not be used at startuoff and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that, ” the company company.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will certainly look carefully at the FAA decision and at the reasons for it.
The impact of the decision on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and customer instruction.
“ Once an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all levels, ” announced the FAA.
In rare cases when visibility is poor, the crew crew instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment should be stored safely under the seat or in the seat partments at take-off and landing.
In front of the area against Schalke, BVB followers with lacaires had caused ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced tough consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the ultras reacted with a silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic that was presented to the viewer until shortly before the starting wn of the Bundesliga match between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the heard were the guest fans with their songs.
The South Grandstand, on the other hand, where the most loyal of the most faithful - and loudest - BVB fans, initially presented itself extraordinarily quiet: no songs, no battle calls.
The platform of the capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint cheering, remained unoccupied.
And at the front of the gallery there was a large flag in the gallery elled' section on the prohibition of stadium'.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller was the first first BVB player to take enter, as always, sparkfire short-term jubers.
When his team colleagues followed, there was loud singing and scarves blowing - but by no means everywhere.
Nothing was in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Grandstand.
The fact that stadium speakers Norbert Dickel again the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause a stiast.
Only five minutes before the koff did the Capo clb his pedestal - and the hitherto almost palpable with tension eruped in a loud cry when the thickle challenged the mood on the slopes in the stadium as usual.
Finally, as always, it was the turn of the South Grandstand - and finally, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the meeting signal from the South Grandstand came with the loud call for " Derysieger stands up ", everything was again as always.
The silence before was probably a response to what has happened in recent days.
Immediately before the quarter ter by at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB trailers had travred light missiles into the audience and into the square - almost almost goalkeeper met Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was started late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had subsequently received the leaders of the Ultras in Dortmund in his office - and one believes Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
" There will be massive cutbacks for the entire ultra-tra movement, " announced the BVB-boss on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the ultras from choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.
'That is what I banned,' he said.
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras have been shown various ways of punishing - until Tuesday they have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BB B will establish a penalty by the end of next week.
" This will be decisive, " Winssaid.
It is interesting to to what the reactions in the South gallery will be.
Pfandhouses are booming in Singapore as the crisis reaches in the middle class
In a deposit house in Singapore ’ s Bendemeer shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga changes a golden braet, a ring, and a pair of earrings to pay their daughters ’ s school fees.
“ My husband and I have just bought a house, all all my money in it, ” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earned $3,000 Singapore Singapore (about €1,730) each month as administrative contributator and her husband works, monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
Indeed, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it changed, it became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore stock Exchange this week.
Vasting jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsafe bank loan.
Typically, deposit dges in Singapore demand an effective 17% annual interest rate, just above the 15.4% required by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, deposit houses offer the advantage that they do not require a review of creditworthiness or proof of income, which is why loans are possible more quickly than with banks.
As a result, millions of people in the region turn to deposit homes as families feel the pressure of rising rising cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit from loose fiscal policies in the developed economies, lower- and middle-income families look for ghomes to make for the difference in a faltering economies.
This week, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly due by rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
The Agency estimates that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list, with 80% of GDP, an increase of 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged out from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a drop in consumer demand.
“ In the end, this means that, as costs rise, middle-middle to bottom (income income)) will try to supplement their income wherever possible, ” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have exacerbated the trend to mortdge of personal items, as people use the opportunity to turn the family ’ s jewellery into cash.
In Singapore, about 70% of the pledged objects in the 200 deposit houses of the city state are gold.
People say to themselves, “ The price of gold looks good, let us pledge grandmother ’ s gold chain and bring it back next month. ”
The largest Thai Pfandhouse operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% increase in its customers in recent months.
The growth in deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax Managing Director.
The company finances this with 60% of Singapore ’ s $66 million that it IPpublic this week in Singapore.
While some lenders have caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that deposit dges would only offer offer lower interest rates than other lenders, but do not directly increase debt directly.
“ Customers borrow objects that they already own, and the liquefy of personal valuables does not increase household debt, ” she explains.
The mortgage brief business is increasingly socially accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Nor are not all people who use ggage in financial difficulty.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax branches to mortdge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60% of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all strata of life come to us.
“ These include wealthy people who borrow for business or investment in the short short run or small small who have to bridge ccash flow bottlenecks, ” says Yeah.
Sometimes they simply need money very quickly.
NSA retritracts data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service behvelle Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany shed light on the increasingly explosive NSA spheres.
According portrathe Green federal Board member Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence official would testify to a German public prosecutor's office or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine " Panorama ".
Bailout of Australia ’ s $325 million for Tasimanan Health
Australia ’ s government insists on the tough conditions associated associated with the $325 Australian Australian bailout out TT’ ’ s health care to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
German Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging island state population, a higher rate of chronic disease, and systemic restrictions.
Funding for a period of four years was decided following government consultations with independent Tasmanan deputy Andrew Wilkie.
“ The government has put together an emergency rescue package,, in our view, addresses the unique challenges the state, ” said Plibersek today.
The $35 million package includes $31 million in emergency aid for electoral benefits.
A further 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and grey artreatments, are intended to eliminate residues.
There is also money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care after in-patient stays, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of an electronic recording system of health data in local hospitals.
“ These investments are in line with the ideas that clinic ics affected have told to are the best way to improve the Tasmanan health system, ” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability by the Tasmanan Government.
The state would have to maintain the current level of financing in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional money was spent.
A three-partite commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if “ it were not accompanied by real reforms that put the Tmanman public health-care system on a more sustainable course. ”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to the request for urgent assistance he first first to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system off the care list, ” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these elections will largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But the opposition spokesman for health, Peter Dutton, believes that today ’ s announcement is only a ‘ paster solution..
“ We are there today because the laboratory government has deducted $430 million from the health system, ” he told ABC TV.
It is not acceptable for a state government to take nearly half a billion dollars of the system and insert the Commonwealth wealth 300 million and then pretend that this is good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on extra bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, one monitoring group said
Syria had destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and latgas gas munitions declared the the ChemChemWeapons Monitoring Group on Thursday, while there were serious clashes in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances alleged to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed soon three years ago since the civil war began war.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came the day before the date
1 November, which organisation Damascus organisation based in The Hague, set set up to destroy or ‘ inoperational ’ all the for for producing chemical weapons, including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is, in fact, the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all chemical chemical Syria by mid-2014.
Destruction the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to start to destroy existing weapons and stocks.
It is suspected that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting was taking place in the city of Safira on Thursday, when experts say that there is a chemical weapons production facility and stockfacilities facilities, as indicated by the UKbased Syrian Human Observatory.
The activist group, which uting the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, declared on Thursday that 20,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government, 29,954 of them were part of President Bashar Assad ’ s army, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated estimated deaths in this conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated.
The conflict has forced some two million people to escape the country.
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have links with al-Qaeda groups.
The Centre said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not specify any details.
The fighting underscores the danger posed by chemical-weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its poisonous arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which coworking closely with the United Nations, the team is “ now convinced that it has seen and has the destruction of all the important production production / fillillfacilities mentioned by Syria. ”
That is why ‘ no further inspection activities are currently planned ’.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of checks and had visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
Due to safety concerns it was not possible to visit two facilities, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPWC declared that, according to Syrian statement, the two sites had “ been abandoned... and that the objects of the chemical-weapons programme there had been transferred to other institutions inspected. ”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will have to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“ I salute the bravery and courage that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever out by this organisation, ” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting a secession of Shia Islam in this civil war against Assad ad s s government and its security forces, to which many members of the Alawites belong.
Looking regards further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there was a major explosion on Wednesday in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Anger JuJument for Bali Bombbers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angry at the sentence for the last of the instigators to be tried because they believed that Umar Patek should be shot under civil law.
Patek, who fled for almost ten years as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
If suspended were suspended, he could be dismissed after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
It was also guilty in a number of terrorist-related charges, including a wave of explosiattacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor ’ s office had called for a life sentence, even if she could have requested the death penalty for the man called called a masterly bomber, also known as the ‘ demolition man ’ ”
The decision evoused painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his fellow conspirators almost ten years ago.
Figgling with tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“ He should be presented with a firing squad, ” Corteen teen to AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not get any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when, shortly after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002, a massive bomb exploded in a small parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded an explosive-filled backpack.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times while hanging on a life-support system.
Hughes said that Patek earned the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Yemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas, and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.
It is is that this guy should be given the death penalty before everyone else.
Keep him alive – no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand on trial.
He eleved almost a decade of arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the hearing, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had pointed out that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden to rebuild the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“ He didn ’ t stand up, ” Corteen teen.
Until recently, he showed no remorance for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict passed before the tenth anniversary of this year's attack, which is being celebrated with commemoration ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“ There will be many tears this year, ” said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but cannot make mobile calls).
Travengers can now listen to their electronic equipment from departure to landing to read, work, play, music, use to watch films, but not by mobile phones, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented ended on the respective airline, explained FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated air crew manutraining manumanuand and the storage storage rules in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA has stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon, ” FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not allowed to restake e-them until the aircraft reaches three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When they landlanding, passengers must turn them off again and must not take them again before the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the equipment at take-off, landing and roller, said the FAA.
Most new commercial aircraft and other airplanes that have been converted for the use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Association of Professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
“ If the new regime is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline to this regard – both sides will benefit, ” Glading commented.
Frankly, we are tired of having to a watchdog on this issue.
However, Internet connections for browsing, sharing e-mails, text messages or downloading data less than three kilometres remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight.
So still no “ Words With Friends, ” resembling the Scrabble online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines in the public because he refused to shut off the device while the aircraft was parked at the gate.
And heavier equipment, such as laptops, must continue to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight also remain prohibited.
Regulatory competence lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at stare-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, national safety expert on CBS News said that mobile phones are still considered a risk.
“ Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause faults in navigation devices, but also because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt transmitter poles, ” says Rosenker.
An industry ’ s consultvisory committee set up by the FAA to examine this issue last month recommended that the government allow wider use of personal electronic equipment.
In recent years, pressure pressure the FAA to ease restrictions on use has increased.
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of appliances has become ubiquitous.
Some studies mention that up to a third of passengers forgets or ignoring the device switched off.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966, after reports of disruption to navigation and communications devices by passenger guided FM radios became known, which were the latest trend in technology at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA in such a way that they do not mind electronic interference.
Airines have been providing Wi-Fi with passengers for several years when the altitude is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more susceptible to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for increasing greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives, as HuHuta ta.
Today ’ s electronic devices generally emit much less than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal radiation if you roll over.
But when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Advocfavour of relaxing passenger restrictions on passenger use of equipment are Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but were unable to identify any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk involved in using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the equipment disturbance was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members have said that there are only a few reports from pilots speaking of equipment disting aircraft systems, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended to the FAA that ots allow pilallowed to order passengers to be shut off in instrument landings in poor visibility conditions.
A group in the travel industry welcomed the amendments and called them a sensible adaptation for travellers who are now extensively equipped with technology.
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with security, ” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Vogel was released by air recuance service from North Sea Bolling insel.
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue rescue service, which had been exhausted on a North Sea rig, was released back into nature.
The water rall was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was poped by the Scottish Animal Protection Organisation SPCA to its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said, “ This rp was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, held ted by strong winds over the North Sea. ”
It seems that the exhausted bird sought refuge on the dririg.
He added: ‘ He could no longer fly any flying, so we were contacted with the request for help ’.
When they were released, the water ral was fit and healthy.
Is Europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the aim of bringing the economy to the table and defining what those who create prosperity and work in Britain want to change change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives, roughly roughly the UK ’ s corporate sizes, sectors, and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want governments to favor new trade links with countries like China, India, and Brazil, rather than stin the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
In their view that asked on certain statutory issues – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, because companies said that the costs of Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trading zone – even 40% of large companies that which are traditionally most pro-European agreed.
After all, and this is probably the most, our consultation with economic leaders showed that a large majority wants Britain to take a course towards amending the agreement, a trade-based relationship with the EU, not politics.
This insight, found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the of action back to Britain.
The matters is high – a change the agreement and better conditions for Britain, 16 16, would lead to a change of opinion in favor of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: poll shows that the British economy is behind his plan renegotiotiate Britain ’ s conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect renegotiation to a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible, and increasingly necessary, as the eurozone moves toward closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey show, what greater attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels Brussels approach to regulation means for businesses.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls the pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
Construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom's Board of Directors.
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone: construction on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun, ” said Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to provide greater diversity on Russia's export routes through Europe.
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of Russia ’ s gas is stored in Europe, creates an increased risk on conventional routes, as officials say.
Miller said that the direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated forever forever eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the whole project comes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries is to begin on the planned route for the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: two YMCA staff accused of accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged of child sexual offences before accusations were brought elled childd-nurer Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
But, in the opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA declared that “ the organization had never been to with an incident of sexual child abuse. ”
Managing Director Phillip Hare was consulted about one case in which one YMCA employee had been accused of child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted of abusing children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, that he was aware of the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA ’ s opening statement to the Commission was also impaccurate in claiming that “ there had been external reviews of the YMCA that ing the YMCA as at the forefront of child safety..
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it received received the lowest lowest rating of four possible ones in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management had failed “ from me down ” to hihire Lord, rather to ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted earlier this year for sexual offences committed against 12 boys during his two years of work for the YMCA.
He has been sentenced to at least six years in prison.
But Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that had prevented staff from reporting Lords ’ violations of children ’ s safety.
The staff said that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, carcared for them privately as a babysitter, let them sit on his lap, told one that he loloved it, and let children play on his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for training on child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the head of child, Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior eriords at YMCA Caringbah, was “ very intimidating and nearby for most of the time. ”
The CEO said that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, which is why they would not have reported him.
Hare explained that he had informed the Board of Directors of YMCA NSW of his view that the lesson that the organization must learn from the Jonathan Lord incident “ does not concern reporting ” by employees, and the Board of Directors has agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign non-disclosure obligations shortly after the allegations was taken by the YMCA ’ s MM's children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said this this prevent contamination contamination of the evidence but which had been ‘ over-zealous ’ and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children during the time Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, explained Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, told the Commission.
He explained that there have been “ serious problems ” in recruiting, checking, training, training, and supervising employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said that he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening to mark the fifth anniversary of his leaving office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as leader, Blair has largely avoided speaking on British politics, and has mostly limited his comments to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Quartet of peacemers in the Middle East.
When asked whether he would like to return to Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London as saying ‘ Yes, safe, but that is unlikely to happen, so... ’

But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The knee, which is not even in the kindergarten and took his first steps only a few months ago, and his Shetland pony Toffee dured loosely through the three rounds and won first prize – leaving leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of the same size, have been praised for their performance, behaviour and style at the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had put on his plate hat in a aueky angle and led the two-year-old tea through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural ability to deal with the pony, well above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his performance and personality.
Fenton received Toffee last March as a present for his third birthday and had since been practiced with the Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “ Fenton and Toffee are a great man. ”
They had to fight the whole field of participants and went off the square with gold trophy and rosette.
It was only the second time he had taken part in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Completely foreigners in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been practiing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, “ The entire audience was like electrified, and everyone fired and applauded him. ”
He ran on sand along the entire length of the arena and, although looking looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares of.
As it started,, won ’ t be long before he is on the “ Horse of the Year ” show – and I am sure he will do well.
As one annual show spokesman said, “ Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony. ”
Together they are a great team.
The jurors judged Fenton and Toffee for how well they would have done and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They take care to work good between pony and the guide – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fenton's sweet clothing played their part to making this really fit perfect occasion.
The Chinese Newspapers is to be “ reformed ’ ” Calling
A Chinese newspaper calling on the front page for the release of a reporter accused of defamation is to reformed reformed declared a press regulator.
The Guangzhou New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a semi-state firm.
Now the New Express is undergoing “ comprehensive certification, ” the regulator declared.
The “ Rectification Order ” came from the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film, and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several accurate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“ The editorial management of the Neue Express was disordered, ” the regulator announced in a statement.
She said that it was decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter licence. ”
In addition, “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to undertake a complete reconstruction of the Neue Express and recommended that it identify the relevant responsible at the Neue Express and immediately check the management team of the Neue Express..
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and backed backed his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television, admitting that he had published false reports for payment.
“ In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence, ” he told the state news channel CCTV.
I did so primarily because I was looking for money and glory.
I have realised that I have done the the wrong thing.
Following Chen ’ s apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page and said that the reports had not been checked correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still being routinely enforced, despite an change in the law earlier this year in which the authorities were banned from forcing someone to accuse themselves.
Discovers drug tunnels with their own rail between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railways, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 x 90 centimetres tunnel as as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigag pattern of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspspicuous warehouses in the area, makes it easier to hide drug-laden lorries.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unnoticed, as the authorities said.
When discovery was discovered, tunnel tunnel eight eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to the Court's records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of owning and selling marijuana and cocaine.
They face the threat of onment of between ten years years and life if a guilty is dict.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of purrigup channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, posing the challenge for the drug cartels of how to quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a 640 metmetre passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residence in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love.
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two year old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken about the separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, which was to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, " Life sometimes sometimes not exactly exactly as we plan or hope ".
Kerr and he still loved themselves, emphasized the 36-year-old.
'We will support each other and love them as parents of Flynn'.
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
According to encyclopveganism is subordinate to vegetarianism, but it differs from it in a considerable way.
While vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream creams, ice cream, or a strong Edam, these delicacies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the meat and fish abandonment, the vegan disins from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one might wonder, but on closer examination, the vegan food world is remarkimaginative.
" Bread spreads are very popular, " explains Ute Henkelmann, owner of the local Reformist House, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor is also happy to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years, born native New Zealand alanders has been living vegan, finding (almost) everything he needs to life life everything Lampertheim.
At the turn of the century the next step was and and became a vegan.
" Convicth came not only because of nutrition, but also because of the choice of footwear, " says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realised that there are also in other everyday issues without animal products.
Primarily, vegan is an ethic.
" I don't want animals to die for me, " ProcProctor about the maxim of vegans, which extends to all consumption patterns.
Instead of mourning burgers, stirring eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, and enthusiasm increased.
" It's a double bonus, " ProcProctor today, " in fact, his vegan is not a renunciation, not an asceticism, it is an asset.
And it was precisely these conditions that caused some well-well-intentioned attempts to fail.
" The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking, " Proctor compares.
And applies:' Certain are not asanchated to the animal'.
It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
" You can also create the same effect in other ways, " the vegan explains.
Proctor brings to a barbecue festival with eggplants, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages.
It takes care of a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste hearty.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, that is legitimate.
" It should taste, but it should not just be reduced to animal food, " Proctor said.
He did not suffered any damage to health, to the extent of eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me there was a positive aspect to the changeover.
I do not absorany foreign cholesterol and have an increased proportion of vitamin.
There are high-performance athletes who only feed vegan.
" My blood values are excellent, I am often checked in, " Proctor tells.
In particular, many critics of veganism warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
" Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is doubtful whether the vitamin B12 content in the meat you you bought in cooling chest is high, " Proctor finds.
Vegegans can also also me the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
" My B12 values are fine, " he explains.
Proctor does not have to go down the long way road for food food.
After all, staple foods are available everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
I will find everything I need on the ground.
Only time and then I buy something special.
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is as we know this is the case with " ordinary " finished products ".
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed.
" There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small tricks you can achieve good, if not partly better, results, " says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with his vegan cheese cake Proctor was able to amaze his parthers-in-law.
Family festivals give the vegan a new spice.
That is dynamic ism. if you vote together, it has a new significance.
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves, " Proctor says.
Of course, he has already been scepsceptical.
Do you not like my meal any more?
" Am I to feel bad now because I drink milk? " - on such questions you have to act as a vegan with sensitivity.
" I do not reject the people, I am part of that society, " Proctor does not want to use enclavvein.
And more closely, the everyday world does not seem as veganous as suspected - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as is commonly believed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are found everywhere!
" Many der shops offer Falafel, or even a vegetarian yuka, " Proctor says.
In a pizzeria he gives fts to pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly getting adapt for this.
'When I started feeding vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult', the New Zealanders can find a development:' You have to talk to the people, make them aware of it'.
" If there are enough requests, they may be inclined to supplement the menu, " he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the compartment in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan meal on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of them.
'Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, and in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,' Proctor notes.
" If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible from the outset, " ProcProctor.
However, purchasing vegan products may be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially when one learns to understand that animal additives can also be present as colducers in peanuts, one seem to be quickly losing the courage by adherence with ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: " Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients added, food as well as detergents.
" Gradually develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have pay attention to, " It's sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble, " Proctor knows.
Veganism, it is an important moral finger that beats awareness.
He may not quite succeed in abandon one's habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question their habits.

British Police are issue Assange with an Extradition Resolution
The British police have today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and sought asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard has declared that the 40-year-old Australian has been sent a “ invitation to face render, ” urging him to appear in a police station, and, if he fails to comply, he threatens threatened with arrest.
Assange is threatened extradition to Sweden for charges of a sexual offence after exhauexhauhis possibilities under British law since the Supreme Court refused to object to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had “ made an invitation to a 40-year-old man to face a police station at a time we chose, ” one spokesman said.
He continues to violthe conditions of his release on bail.
The message made no comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears that he will be extradited by Sweden to the United States, accused of of espionage after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic news on WikiWikiLeaks ’ ure website.

Tax on Foreign Hwners against London ’ s Speculative Bble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, to impose a 7% stamp tax in the 2012 budget on housing costing more than £2 million, and annual fees on buyers who hold housing as a company, not as individuals.
Already, the revenue from the stamp tax on housing in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which was GBP 708 million in the 2012 / 13 year, exceed the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the NorEast, north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber region put together.
Cook said, “ After the increases in stamp taxes on high-price housing and the introduction of legislation legislation to evvent them, it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is too low taxed, regardless of the impact of the outdated local tax system. ”
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying or preventing owners from buying property in London, ” he added.
First-class properties – the top 5-10% of the housing market by price – in London ’ s wealthy southwest belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, have become more expensive, a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London grew evenevenly of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market, ” where the souwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%), and the east (6.5%) experienced an upuptrend, according to Savills s.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the connection between a dog ’ s tail and its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wwwith the tail more to the right (from the dog ’ s point of view), while for nervous dogs it was the the left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said, “ Man is well known that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions. ”
Here we have tried to look at this for other species.
He also noticed that in dogs, as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for left-wing movement, and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral sforests of their fellow species, researchers supervised the animals as they watched films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of four-legged animals and analysed the behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving one direction direction the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “ We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate didistractive aspects, and we have thus been able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right. ”
When the animals saw an otherwise expressive dog move the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail propensity was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog waving), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
He is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience which movements they should and should not be worry about.
He said, “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and swallowelling with the tail in one direction is more with friendly behaviour, and the right side produces less friendly behaviour, you rereact on the basis of these experiences. ”
Researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could provide a better understanding of the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, an expert in Dog behaviour and guest schollowship at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine whether was important for dogs on the left and right.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when it is a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria, Canada, said that “ Dogs approach a robot dog dog when when “ tail wings ” on the left, not on the right, rather than restless – just the other way around than in the Italian study. ”
He says that differences differences stem from the the that that dogs in the various dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help he explained.
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for various purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception, ” Bradjw said.
But since their behaviour is easy to recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.

Pope Francis Appoints the First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will convene new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and it is they who elect a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men to eventually help choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
But a cardinal of the age of 80 can no longer take part in the Pope ’ s election – compared to a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals. ”
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that there would be a meeting of all all cardinals als before holding the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the consistency.
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the consistency in February order to plan other meetings requiring the participation of cardinfrom from around the world around the world, ” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of electoral cardinals is likely to have fallen by February.
He said that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as he needs to restore the number of cardinals to vote back to 120 120, and many many cardinals over 80 as he likes.
Next year's consistency is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero says.
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe, and in of Italy in particular.
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance, ” he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they have a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, established by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world charged with finding ways of reforming the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided on by himself.
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him, ” Valero said.
He said that it was “ quite possible ” for Francis to seek advice cardinals dinals.
So far, however, we have not been in this situation – this is all completely new.
Valero said that the bishops from large places would typically be called cardinals, but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we don ’ t know who he is appointing. ”
GM is calling back new pickup pressure in the US to repair the seat rest.
General Motors recall nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup pressure 2014 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest, according to the US vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
Some of the cars may experience a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front backrest.
That is why they do not comply with the federal guidelines on vehicle safety in head restraints.
“ When you to the vehicle from the back, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the ants, thus an increased risk of injury, ” read the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1st and September 10th.
The delivery of GM shocks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
Due to the 16-day government shutdown, the NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra pressures, which were newly developed for the model model year, increased by 20% in the first months of the year, GM explained on Friday.

GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4% to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The Cry of Despair from an Obama voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts, thwarted by the Republican blockade tactics.
The politics of blockade does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone strikes.
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 campaign were a sad reminder of what could could done
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I read a reading reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I thought would stir me up and restore hope during the gloomy second year of my medical studies.
It is “ The Audacity to Win, and describes Barack Obama ’ s memoirs in the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish with my patient scripts in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and took a speech's breath away.
The election became a landslide victory, with news spokesmen to ating the historic significance of this moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on its way to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had 82% approval ratings.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a evil awakening, like being being taken out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Something has changed in the years since I first voted.
But it is simply not I could imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act on health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I agree that the party political blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But, having defended the Obama administration against colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have ended with trying to explain it.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The republican policy of blockade cannot explain why foreign foreign foreign leaders be allowed to interept, or the killing of innocent children by overseas drones.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers who disclose government misconduct are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and spending limits are being bypassed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report that states that the White House ’ s efforts to silence the media are the ‘ ‘ aggressive … since the Nixon Government ’.
More recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know whether that is what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood, at the age of 18, that the government might contradict the political campaigns preceded it?
Obviously, the Office of Deputies is not a predictable course of action, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre charactershaping public debate.
However, when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that is what bothers me most.
I re-for Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative; he seemed to be unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope we have heard about for so long.
But, as Obama ’ s approval ratings fall to less than 45% this week, this book has made it the harder to return to 2008.
It awires ens the longdesire for the many promises that have evaporated.
This week, I read a section in the book describing how Obama suffered a severe loss against Clinton in Pennsylvania ’ s primaries.
In a meeting with the election workers after the decision, he told his staff had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
“ I want us to find our magic, ” he said.
We must remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr President, and I could not agree more with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on parental.
The billionaire and MP, Clive Palmer, says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interests in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, engaged in a judicial dispute about pay $6 million to a carbon tax, claimed when he wanted to sweep aside questions as to whether it was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, are important in deciding whether to cut or cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott's daughters would benefit personally from the law.
“ He is in a major conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she is on holiday, ” said mer mer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes ahead after the recount.
Palmer called for a review of the vote-counting process so that it can take place more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“ We need a better system, ” he said.
Why should we not have a system where you enter, entering data into a computer, choosing immediately and then have the result at 6: 30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils in marking the ballot papers.
Do we use them because we can then wipe out the results if you do not like them?
Harmonoting with pencils these days is unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission examined the options for an electronic election and has recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, declared that his policy includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and that he will take his new post “ very seriously. ”
A public office is about serving the public.
“ We are striving for any reward but history, namely that we can serve this community at a critical time, ” he said.

UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma declared that was was ating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently working on allegations that bankers have agreed on currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has stirmoled traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year it has been under pressure, because low currency volatility restricts speculators ’ chances.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders do not this is is necessarily true.
A leading trader observed that, despite the enormous daily volume of foreign-exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of banks ’ own own platforms by platforms means that “ you can influence the market with very low ticket prices. ”
The news came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it had terminmissed a trader in its London Exchange Traded Fundations Office this week, having causing a loss of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed and cooperates with the relevant authorities.
“ We are sure that the trader acted on his own and that the matter is contained, ” Credit Suisse said.
Pted the Fence on the Bechtle Plot
A group of the citizens' initiative " Swiss Wiese " has embellished the fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
It also cleaned ed and widened its footpath, according to a press release.
The planned cover of the crumbling house at the back of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, as the site threatens to slip.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the the, had denied the beautification with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the BI's action, a banner with the message' we were in favour' was put up.
However, this did not disther the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative' action.
Their motto on the big poster was' We are against building ruins'.
In doing so, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the gigantic project one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the " construction site ", it became clear that some citizens believe that many will do the city's project will be better, although quite a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city deldelthese answers further, says the BI.
As we have heard, the public statements of the mayor also have an impact.
In May, at the local council meeting said that he feared the end of the thermal baths if the population would vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the citizens' decision.
Some therefore seem downright frightened, others see it as a' crude attempt at blackmail' against the population, according to the BI's press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers.
Rangnick Scents for Schiris: Don't lack SwalwalKing
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the " bulls " was disappointed by the referees.
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the swallow king category, " he protected the two offensive swirrates at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest reason for Rangnik's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3 3-0 versus Bigdena last Sunday, during which the Senegalese was victim with an alleged acting - but it was not, as the TV pictures showed.
" A blating wrong decision, " Rnick said, calling referee Harkam " completely overstretched. "
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and size coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German compatriot:' I would have behaved in the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation'.
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague with his colleague after the skirmish.
I do not know why.
" For I am the one who was insulted, " the 46-year-old stressed.
In view of its success, however, Rangnick was a hymn of praise.
" There are only two words for this: really good, " he said.
There is not much to with.
The way in which the team plays is particularly impressive.
Let this continue.
There will be little change in management during the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
" Except one player approaches with the desire to leave the club, " Rangnick made clear.
The Supreme Court affirms Obama ’ s Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court decided ruled that the health-care law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five votes four votes, judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy chose it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages law, and also considered that the health-care Act ’ stipulated that states should either extend the conditions for access to Medicaid or otherwise otherwise cancel all state Medicaid subsidies was not unconstitutional restrictive.
The case had been brought against the law by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the eventchallchallenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian Place is GimirmirrLight
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village shed light on their gloomy valley.
Due to the low sunlight, Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord Valley, usually sinks into the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 metres in height, a dream of the century came true on Wednesday.
" Finally! " was sened mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony on TV2.
Some inhabitants of the valley got ked with sun loungers, others set up sunglasses for safety.
Up to now, sun-hungry people have had to take a cable car to a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to use radiation of mirrors into the valley.
However, this basic idea has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the project worth SEK 5 million (around EUR 615 000).
For several years now, a similar construction has provided winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine resort of Viganella.
Post scarcely empty on Sundays
" Many citizens will not have noticed noticed that the red dots for Sunday people are still on various post boxes in the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find out that emptying no longer takes place on Sundays and holidays, " says the FDP.
A request from the FDP has confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, emptied is only only in front of the post building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether Sunday days will still be place in Hofheim und Rosengarten will not be answered in the answer to the German Free Democratic Democratic Party ’ s question.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the German Free Democratic Party (FFDP), Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to press on this.
Sunday days are an important postal service, especially for appointment mail.
'Despite the increase in the price of letters in January 2013, this undertaking radically and unacceptably pinning them'.
Thomas Bittner, leader of the Liberal group and city association, supports his group colleagues:' What annoys me is the fact that empvactimes times are being secretly changed or even deleted'.
The post office is miles away from being being close to the citizens.
" At least the mailboxes in the districts Neuschloß und Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays, " says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
The core city, also, to fellow citizens, non-mobile ones, should be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday sleots on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the City Parliament whether the city council is planning talks with the post office on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
To his knowledge, however, there is also a Sunday artist in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out in favour of privatisation.
" Then decisions will be taken elsewhere, " Maier said.
Frankfurt Park Fare set to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become much more expensive.
The magistrate of the city advises this morning on a presentation by traffic decorant Stefan Majer (Green).
Consequently, parking charges are to be increased by 50%.
For this, however, it is not to raise prices, but to reduce the time interval of clocks and automatic ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the Municip' Assembly will then have to decide.
The ail Committee of the Chamber of Commerce of Frankfurt does not consider this this is' a good idea'.
The room was very small and the bathroom was very small.
The transport club Germany believes that an increase after two decades is' entirely appropriate and in fact long overdue'.
Public transport will also be more expensive.

The Gönniers struextremely difficult with the tough and placed premikes.
On several occasions, they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard necleanly over the middle of the net and were not there to defend defend the block.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the Freuous cities in all respects.
In view of this overwhelming and playdetermining achievement, the third sentence was won somewhat bit lax and sluggish at the 3: 0 final score (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).

TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Friends City stood each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a fierccompetitive two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and point points, when taking the ball; in passports, too, precision was sometimes in short supply; and in some critical scenes, the overzealousness prevented the view of possible point gains.
In this powerful very balanced encounter, however, in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto, the great commitment commitment and commitment of both teams was consistently right.
Carintening Day at the Small English Hut
On the fifth day of care in the succession to the Natura 2000 project of Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.

Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grass ppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest land.
You need these free links to species conservation.
Tribukait said that she did not fail to stand for for planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not only fit seamlessly into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity to achieve sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised UNESCO status and thus a continuous complement to what has been achieved with the Life project as well as previous care days for the future.
After these various explanations, the area manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten beforehand and the forestry tractor would be called up if necessary.

Did you think that travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be opposing ing trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and expects record income from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects adjusted annual pre-tax profits of between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 million and $315 million in its previous forecast.

As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre made 8% profit in the first half of the year and made a strong start in the second half of the year, particularly in the Australian and British private sectors.
“ Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some are well on the way to record year income before interest and taxes, ” he explained.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically among our strongest sources of results.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, balancing a slightly weaker market for business trips.
Things went similarly well for Flight Centre ’ s leisure business in the UK, while business customers also spent less.

Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling elling and grammar.
In courses on English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a nineteenth-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The exam also includes “ unseen texts ” to encourage more wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be disfted.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to take an own GCSE exam for language, and there be strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education will publish the new English and mathematics curricula – the first subjects that have been radically transformed.
Other core areas will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Supervisory Authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less price work.
In a speech this summer,, Education Education Michael Gove said that “ there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence, ” stressing that the GCSEs would become “ more challenging, ambitious, and stricter. ”
Studies show that English schools spend less time spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year, or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
By contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to allow more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that comprehensive maths testing, combined with a greater weighting of skills in rankings – is likely to encourage schools to spend more hours.
The curriculum places more attention on “ real life problems, ” including financial mathematics.

Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend treating hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000.
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to be him as the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his exceptional work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his sick father lose again lose consciousness and traveltravel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, Cameroon's capital.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain and causing a haematoma would affect him for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, ” says Georges Bwelle.
We would have released him from Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to receive the treatment they had.
“ It ’ s not easy, ” comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, yet you are not the first.
There are a great many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
In the United States, on the other hand, relations are a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most cameroons could not afford to visit.
Two in the country ’ s five people live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country ’ s health spending is private.
“ The only problem they have is poverty, ” Bwelle says.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his compatriots suffer in the wave made he decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME which travels to rural areas at weekends and provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his voluntary group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into minibuses and use snow-medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
Not everything always runs smoothly.
On more than one occasion they have had to push vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive they are received like heroes: a feast, singing and dance, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care really is a cause for celebration and wave – with its wide smile and boundless energy – is to at the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team starts examating hundreds of patients.
“ We treat 500 people per trip, ” says welle said.
You come from a 60 kilometre radius of the village – and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for school but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team runs simple operations with local anaesthesia.
Operoperations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the operation, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next bour.
The lighting for the operation and the disinfection equipment is supplied by the group of group so so Bft and and his volunteers until the early the morning on Sunday.
It's a strenuous effort, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“ They are drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work, ” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will go back to the city, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year, and knows that its work makes a huge difference to the people it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a frature he received now allows him to work again.
“ This changes the future of my family, ” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in hospital hospital BBwelle works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60% of his non-profit work, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“ I really don ’ t know when he ’ s sleeping, ” says Katie O ’ Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and voluntevolunteworks in Bwell ’ s group.
He is always either in hospital temptrying to raise money for the organisation so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical students and sing students like O'Malley ley who come from the US and Europe and support Bwave, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience they would never get at home.
" We can be involved in operations where we help to drain blood or consider the instruments to be Dr. Bwelle, " explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon and often bring donated medical material.
Once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle will take care of the accommodation, transport and instruction.
" He's without doubt a hero, " says O'Malley.
He deates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no bounds.
Almost permanent work is not a burden for Bwelle.
Helping others to live a happier life, thereby fulfilling a promise he made to his father, gives him great pleasure.
“ I ’ m so happy to do this work, ” says Bwelle.
And I am thinking of my father.
I hope he will see what I do.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellent in the Fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel " The Old Man and the Sea ", is Horst Janson cut to his body.
Janson is himself an old rabare in his profession, acting.
No one can deleive eive the old man Santiago while fishing.
The two simply complement each other magnificently.
One almost thinks one can see the folds in the neck of the old man to whom the fishing boy Manolo refers.
If Santiago sits tired of life bowed on the chair, that is true with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is a characteristic role that Janson plays excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man, who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against fish through his knowledge and also his will.
Janson is largely on stage as a single actor.
He managed to focus the audience ’ s attention so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that spectators forget that the sea is made up only blue bottles of water.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance he brings the active scene into light: the hut of Santiago, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings Cuba ’ s feeling of life with her songs and magnificent voice.
The four musicians play Cuba ’ s rhythm and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
A seal from the Roman has is preserved at a length of about 120 metres below Cologne.
Visitors to Cologne cannot pass around the cathedral.
The two towers rise about 157 metres into the sky, making it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two delicate church towers would suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for his guided tours is the service centre of Köln-Tourismus directly at the Dom.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: " We start in the underground garage, " says Schulze.
In the seventies, the fathers of the city wanted a city that was their car, therefore therefore, of the remains of the old city wall, only that was not too large remained.
Today, most users of the multi-storey car park are rushing past the Roman remains and only park off their cars.
However, if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal grids in the Ddeck D2.
About five metre high ruins can be seen ruins made of hand-sized stones.
" They are remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century B.D., " Schulze says.
Before it comes back to light, Schulze lets the participants on the upper level take a gliglimpse into a dark 15 metre deep shaft.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticeable.
The next stop of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants descend into the depth.
We are witnessing the seat of once the most powerful man north of the Alps, the preacher of CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ", which in plain English means " City of Roman Law and the City of the Agrippinensans, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar " for the imperial cult ".
And the pretorium is the former governor palace, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
A tunnel access to the Roman sewage canal leads from anteroom of the exhibition, which has been preserved here at a length of about 120 metres.
" You can walk along a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you like, " Schulze encourages the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After collecting the key at the checkoffice, he leads the group to a 16 metre deep walkin shaft.
" We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath, " he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to obtain the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing.
To this day, at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different levels of water can be seen by changing changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe becomes part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square, for which construction is due to begin shortly.
However, it will take a few years to be completed.
leg almost hacked off: Repof of Rocker Process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is being reopened after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous injury injury and damage damage to property two 30-year olds has begun before the Frankfurt District Court (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety measures.
The defendants remain silent at the the start.
They were said to have been active in the rocker scene and one of the bandidos at the time.
The public prosecutor's office accuses them of having stablown and beaten in three men in a car in June 2009, together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured, and a man almost lost his leg.
Vicvictims are said to have belonged of the competing group of Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a senior member from Berlin.
It seemed to be preceded by a chase with several cars.
According to the charge that this was about rebattles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been acquitted in initial trial at the beginning of 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not been proved that the men were indeed involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice overturned the judgment after the revision of the Public Prosecutor's Office and rejected it to the District Court for renegotiation.
One of the defendants is currently in execution for another crime.
At the beginning, the main focus was to reconstruct the procedures during the Tatnight.
As a witness, the Commissioner investigating at the time was invited.
The focus was on mobile phone conversations between the accused and other people who had intercepapped by the police.
What is difficult is that rockers almost always abide by a law that looks to them in court, not testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had packed.
Public Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office of Frankfurt (Oder) said on request that new traces have emerged since the last trial.
Elemore days of negotiation are scheduled for the trial.
The disposable Society Does Not Think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good good, but at some it goes home.
The only thing is that hunger is noticeable the people's bellies on the front-passenger and back seats.
Of course, some cocktails or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What could be more obvious than chiling to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a little detail?
I admit that I will be happy to be there when it comes to fast-food late or early in the morning.
A few fries, colcol, a burburger and then not as if from home and in bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangs are apparent.
After all, what should you miss is regularly throw your fast-food bags out of the car window?!
Especially at weekends, there are discarded paper bags at the roadof and in parking parks.
'Why?' I wonder.
Are people too doof to take the bags home or back until the next trash bin?
It is not just the case that the paper spoils the landscape.
Bags have already concealed transport facilities such as safety barriers, causing accidents.
But what is said' disposable society' does not think about, it probably does not even know what that word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evening, especially with more with more than people in a car, you know what a back bench can look like after busy night: clothing, bottles and other rubbish come up up.
A few bags would not make up more or less any at - unlike the road, where no one wants to trample around on the food ftovers of others.
I can already see the day when when towns and communities will become too stupid - and the fast-food chains will have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Obama ’ s Withdrawdown in Health Policy
After strong criticism, President Obama backed drew yesterday on his oft-repeated, clear promise: “ If you like your health insurance, you can keep it. ”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurer received a letter of dismissal, the Republicans have accused the president in recent days of deceived the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relative perspective his original promise.
“ They can keep the vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance, ” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on redundancies, Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price, or more than than predicted.
“ You will get a better offer, ” he said.
The government found it hardly surprising that the 5% of the population who have themselves taken out insurance would have to look for a different rate, because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“ I would like to say directly to these Americans: they deserve better, ” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House of entatives ’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, declared that the launch of the online platform has been “ misyerable ” since October.
“ I am as frustrated and angry as anyone else, ” she said.
I am determined to regain your confidence.
This statement by an angry Sebelius about an adviser behind her at yesterday ’ s House of Representatives hearing was received following a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long of Missouri over whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly besithe ed why the “ architect ” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced governsponsorsponsorinsurance to take out her own tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm the attack on Syria ’ s air base
An American official who wanted to remain anonymous told to the news caster CNN on Thursday that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air base in Latakia, Syria, the day before.
The target was' rockets and related equipment', which the Israeli Government feared had been destined the Lebanese Hezbollah, according according to CNN.
The Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab station Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that base base in port port of of akia had been been shdown from Wednesday Thursday Thursday night, holding the Israelis responsible for this.
Israeli television station Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, which Russian S-125 125 Neva missiles and a SA-3 missiles, which, according Channel Channel 2, have 35 kilometres in range and warheads can transport up to 70 kilograms.
Unure, the government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not safe.
In any case, one spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said:' We are not commenting on these reports'.
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried earlier, partly successfully, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a' red line' followed by a military response.
John Kerry states in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has “ gone unduly too far. ”
John Kerry indicated with an unexpected admission a sofening of America ’ s defensive stance to its surveillance programs by saying that espionage has “ gone unreasonably too far ” in certain cases.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching to “ autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of the whistle blolower Edward Snowden about the NSA ’ s spying activities became public.
The leaked information has left the US government into a diplomatic storault of indignation from its allies.
In a speech broadcast by video connection at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said, “ There is no doubt that the President and I and others in the learned about a number of things that were place quasian autopilot, simply there was the ability to do so, which goes back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, to September 11 th. ”
He was became the first senior member of the US administration to admit that US espionage had crossa line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: ‘ In some cases it has gone unduly too far ’.
The President is determined to clarify matters and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one must feel that abuses are taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not comaffected in this process.
But Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force for good, and that many lives were saved saved its surveillance.
He added, “ We are facing a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves up. ”
There is radical extremism in the world obsessed with killing, blowing up people and attacking governments.
So what happen if we were able to intercept and stop it before it happened?
We have indeed prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we learned beforehand about such plans.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to allay concerns about America ’ s alleged espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in counter-terrorism effort, as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats not to participate in anti-terrorist organisations because of the frustration with monitoring by the National Security Agency.
“ It is very important for US national security interests for Europeans to remain on board in our joint efforts against terrorism, ” said Murphy, who sits in the Senate for the first time the first time and and as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger at the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have weighed down relations with some US allies, although the head of the intelligence this week has stated that the reports are incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents from Snowden that the NSA had monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national secret services, James Clapper, defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared that this was customary on both sides.
In all the turoil, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the Congressional trip to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other Members involved are due to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some “ serious words. ”
He said that European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they themselves have used for years.
“ While we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones spy, ” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is about to travel to the Middle East and Poland at the weekend to address resentment about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance.

Australian appeals Prisail in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for wrongly claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, aled against the sentence and released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June of making a false after after ing to the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped them in the morning on Sunday 10 June, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had come at her hotel safely after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The police in Phuket interroated Bamford for two days until they admitted that they invented the story.
Until the trial she was in police custody on the ground.
Bamford has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-level detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Rubgy League player in Australia who has approached the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help from his daughter.
Tunks told to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about his daughter ’ s well-being and wanted to have her back in Australia.
“ We are, of course, very concerned, but we hope that she will be back at home as soon as possible, ” Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is a deposit of 50,000 Baht at large.
Australian reports read that in the meantime she is going on holiday in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The Court said that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned warned that appeal appeal could lead to to imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that, following the recent murder of Michelle Smith's travel clerk in Phuket, Thailand may try to improve its nised tourist image, thus a acquittal.
