Gutach: More Safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres away: the new B 33-pedestrian light has into operation at the village parking place on Tuesday in Gutach - in view of the older town hall lamps.
Two plants so close to each other: a intention or a turtle?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's mayor yesterday.
" The City Hall lamp was installed at that time because it secures the way to school, " Eckert explained yesterday.
The small traffic lights protects both cycliclists and bus passengers as well as mountain residents.
The plant officially in operation yesterday is important for the intersection of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ‘ Grub ‹.
" With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to be produced for their safety ", says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Office of the Council of Offenburg.
" According to current measurements, about 12 000 vehicles pass through Gutach on the B33 33 33 a day, about 10 percent of which are covered by heavy goods traffic, " stresses Arnold.
Therefore the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: " Safety simply simple here ", according to Arnold.
The first time the the city began in Berlin in the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. After the end of the the Berlin. But at about the end of the 19th century, the construction of the began at the beginning of the end of the (second half of) the the early 20th century (in the middle of the century).
According to Arnold, everything has been tested before at the location of the traffic light posts: " By means of of a wooden transporter, which is been equipped with long long long wooden triks, which are specially loaded for us, we we have worked out whether these vehicles can leave from the SulSulzbach weg onto the B 33 without tricking the traffic traffic lights ".
The traffic light itself, worth around EUR 15 000, is " the most modern system currently on the market, " explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly so that car lights can be easily recognized by drivers even, for example, in low sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian moves the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free comes immediately green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor verifies whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
" If a group or handicap people go across the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will get safely over the road, " said ArnArnold.
Of course, the driver must be involved here as a partner and watch the track.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly were the traffic lights for pedestrians green, an upper class vehicle smoked through - in shining red.
Josef Winkler has written the hardship of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The Carinthian poet often described the disasters of his Catholic village children - the spethlessness, the incincation to brute violence and brute sexuality, the hardity and helplessness.
The Büchner Prize winner is known especially known as a prosaauthor, and theatre texts are rare even in his work. He is also known the the the of the Büchner ((the the) ()).
Collage from prose texts written by Gerhard Fresacher therefore together a collage of prose texts for his performance " Wetterleuchten " auf der Zunspitze (Zungenspitze), which is now to be seen in Garage X on Peter's Square.
The theatre maker also, for example, combines elements from the autobiographical novel " Der Leibeigene " (1987) with prosaminiatures from " LeiLeichnam, seine Familie auernd " (2003).
On the largely unresolved stage - important test point: a water-shaped sofa on which it is probably copied and masturbated - eight-member ensemble hangles through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text.
The 70-minute performance abosses the template with a abundance of rainy cases, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms.
The actresses in particular are involved in the sometimes somewhat dubious scenic implementations.
They are hard touched, dipped with the head under water, with their evening robes to the wall.
Gripped in cellellophan or thider, they push them on dangerously high sticks through the staging, either monologize them loudly or lie completely silent grounded on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly communicates in this hard way.
The best moments have the evening when it is sung - the range ranges from Deep Purple to folk song.
Only at the end does the overturned performance come to quiet, and Winkler ’ s almost absurd humor flashes.
A black box in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining Highway system, and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that finds space on the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record each kilometre driven and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to review the outdated system of financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertaries have allied with environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres travelled – and possibly, where they have been driven – and then use information to calculate tax mohumes.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But, while Congress cannot agree, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how to switch over the next ten years to a system where driver pays per mile driven.
Thousands of car drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which have been equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is, in fact, a must for our country.
“ It is nothing that we will possibly use, ” said Hasan Ikkhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record miles miles for all California car drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed by taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is bankrupt.
But America no longer tastes as much as it used to do.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians, at high fuel prices, do not dare to raise the tax by just one cent.
“ gasoline tax is simply not sustainable, ” said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a middle-based payment system.
“ This is the most sensible alternative in the long term, ” he said.
bureaucrats call it as a mile-based user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea respopular with urban liberals, because the tax could, for example, could be used to influence driving behavior to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust.
California ’ s planners are counting on the system in developing strategies to achieve the federal state ’ s ambitious targets on climate change change.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that this is the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also eager to have drivers pay after the distance returned.
“ This is not a tax disappears in a black hole, ” explains Adrian Moore, Vice President for Guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers who, in a report in 2011, asked Congress to move toward milele-based accounting.
The US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, which would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to the concerns of rural parliamentarians who represent people who often have to travel many miles to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several states and large cities are nevertheless moving in this direction.
The most committed is Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 riders for the country ’ s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay mileage fees to the state instead of the oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with lorries.
And the I-95 coalition, comprising includes transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not universal.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, car drivers were skeptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements.
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem, ” explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategic and Outcome Management at Nevada's Ministry of Transport.
People did not want.
When the test started, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into sophisticated surveillance devices. ”
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology with which the state to measure the kilometres travelled, but not exactly when and where.
According to Khan, this would also reassure the public.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not initially intervene to help states tax car drivers.
Rather, it was to take root in an emerging market for insurance insurance, where drivers would pay based on miles.
But the equipment she has tested are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
“ People are more willing to participate when their speed and locations are not recorded, ” said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Considerable mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this.
In Oregon, planners experiment with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose a equipment at all and instead they pay a flat fee based on the average miles operated by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a mistrust public by providing the equipment with more functions than the few.
In New York City, transport officials want to develop a tax device that can also pay parking fees, pay insurance only for kilometres travelled, and speed collection data from other vehicles in real time to enable drivers to avoid congestion.
“ Drivers would be motivated by the added value of the benefits that the system offers to participate, ” says in a city planning document.
However, some transport planners are wondering whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction exercise.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said that Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual charge could be imposed on car drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol so that they also pay a fair share.
" There is no reason for an operation when an aspirin is sufficient, " explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do, hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small Team Beats Wacker
The volunteer fire brigade performed her husband ’ s test with colours, despite a lack of staff.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
In his training course, the departdepartment commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate Feder in Burgberger Straße.
A short circuit is to be established there in the time of sawing.
Two people were wounded by the resulting fire and the smoking development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After Hans Kammerer ’ s first examination of the situation, two respiratory carriers of the defense were prepared to enter the building.
After a short time it managed to find the first person and get into the open.
The second person had to wear.
This was not so easy as a narrow staircase to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it.
In addition, there were also electric machines for the processing of wood.
The first extinguishing attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was conducted via a flood hydrante about 100 meters away.
It was now possible to design three extinguishing attacks.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also worked in the exercise to show what is to be done with few available staff.
In case of emergency, support is provided by the Königsfeld daily intervention group.
The commander was satisfied with the way the exercise was carried out.
Connecting universities and firms
During his visit to Breisgauau High Black Forest, Land President Guido Wolf also found information in TiTititisee Neustadt about where tomorrow's s workers come from.
At the High Black Forest Forest Support Centre, he worked with the senior school leaders of vocational schools, the district ymnasium and the chairs of the parents' board to address this important question.
" Education is an important location factor, " stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project High Black Forest Education Centre.
Wolf was impressed by all the model projects in the field of training.
Since 2011, a successful cooperation has been established between the Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and BerufsBerufsschulzentrum in the Wälderstadt.
He also praised the family friendliness of the district.
" It is important not to look only at the family phase but also, due to demographic change, also the phase for the caring of loved ones, " Wolf explained.
He also said that more and more employees were taking care of the care and care of their loved ones.
" Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to employment relations, " said Wolf.
But no one can afford to lose a skilled workforce, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
" The person who has already experienced the benefits of the region during his studies, who often often presertains the regional economy with his acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to the strengthening of the region, was convinced by the President of the country.
It is only if sufficient training places were offered that the need for a skilled workforce could also be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its favourable location in the south-west of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
Furthermore, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made for the development of local public transport.
" Keep persisting, and ensure that public transport gets better, " he said to the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
The Kaul family (Kaul) has been inviting the Dietinger elderly to coffee, cake and then a body for 15 years.
In the past, elderly elderly were run in the rest centre.
This afternoon is now taking place in St. Josef ’ s nursing home.
The home dwellers looked forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle performed popular melodies with her father Karl Kimmir.
The over 100 year old natural stone wall, the delimitation of the old school courtyard before the renovation to the Kirchstraße, will again be set again on the rehabilitation costs plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the kilbig, during the first works of the reconstruction of the front school, a small tangular wall was built for the stabilization and static relief of the over one hundred year old natural stone wall with Balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the Office of National Monuments is to be included in the planning process and to create a plan for the restoration of the old wall.
This calls for costs to be calculated by experts experts which will then be put on the table to the Community Council to decide and decide on how to proceed.
A decision on this will probably be taken next year.
After the rehabilitation, paving and planting of the old school ’ s courtyard within the two wings of the school, built in 1912, the limitation wall of the school in need of restoration must be be from scratground and placed on new foundations in the foreseeable future.
The historic one hundred year old wall of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstraße is mainly caused by damage to water and frost, since there is no existing drainage, needs to rebuilt and has an arch's tendency forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones show weather damage, but the wall is not currently vulnerable to collapse.
A standproof wall is a prerequisite for a school yard used by students, which has been done by the current mounting work.
Initially, school schooling was even planned even in 2008 / 2009, but high unplanned expenditures brought a shift.
The National Monument Office will say an important word in the historic refurbishment of the school wall, which has already been used even for film recordings.
Should specifications come from this page, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the monument protectors.
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school, which are now taught in a well-reconstructed old school building with new Aula, will soon be able to use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir will receive jazz training in Stuttgart.
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now become involved in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
" I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart, " said Özdemir the " Stuttgarter Nachrichten ".
Jazz and classical belong together at the jazz location of Stuttgart.
Özdemir Ödemdemir, who is in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate in the German federal elections on 22 September, is thus contradicting the Green / Red state government.
Based on an expert study, this is forces a reorganization of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, among others, the course of Jazz and Pop to be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
US frontier:' super tunnel' discovered for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the US, investigators have discovered and shut down a' super-tunnel' for drug smuggling.
As US customs authorities reported, the over 500 metre long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail tracks and ventilation equipment.
Three suspects were therefore arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated.
According to the data, the tunnel had not yet been put into use.
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig through under the radar, " said the Attorney of the US District of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference ahead of a warehouse in San Diego, where an end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Duffy said to the drug gangs:' If you go on to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money'.
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in a permanent battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77th 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by Experts
Due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction lasted about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building located 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 metres into the depth to the actual entrance of the tunnel.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimetres.
It would also have been able to promote illegal immigration in the direction of the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine union.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened with the maximum penalty of life imprisonment, as officials have said.
Eight such tunnels had been discovered since 2006, as stated at the press conference in San Diego.
However, it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction.
Normally, cocaine is being smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the " despair " of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, Bill Sherman said of the DEA drug search in San Diego.
They would do everything they can to get to the United States.
It was said that no details has been given about the detainees; at least one is Mexicicans.
They must count on prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 Geisinger ’ s Year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first mention of documents is drawing ever closer.
When the year ends in more than eight weeks, the anniversary year is approaching.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794.
A document mentioning both places was produced in churches.
On 15 March, there is to be an official official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen does not have a hall, this preloff event will take place, in the place where both were first mentioned about 1250 ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
In the context of the anniversary, several events are planned, both in Geisingen and in Kirchen-Hausen.
Kirchen-Hausen wird im Juli einem Festchenende vom 18 bis Juli 20 die 1250.
Celebrating return.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
At this festival weekend there is also the Church -Hausener Kirchenfest.
Rudolf Barth, director of city music, has written an order position for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On June 21 together with the Sonnwendof the Black Forest Association, on July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This is finished and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
A new chronicle will also be released during the Geisinger ’ s City Jubilee.
" It is to become a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about today's s ssinging, which just consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen, " says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today ’ s violosinging also celebrates its 2014 birthday; in 1974 today ’ s spatialization was carried out with the unigregations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on November 21 or 22, at the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also another year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, Harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years and on March 29 has the festival banquet and then celebrate the district music festival from May 1 to May 4.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and will celebrate this on May 10, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and will celebrate this at the Well well Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in 764 in a gift document owned by the monastery of St. Gallen.
The document was produced in churches, which was then the place of the court.
In other words both municipalities are mentioned in the same document.
The reason is to celebrate this 1250 year in 2014, in addition to the shape of the the parish it is also 40 years ago.
The Council is targeting tracks
Is the' Am Hirschen' railway crossing to be reextensively, in order to increase road safety?
Yes, the local councils decided.
For this purpose, Schiltach must provide EUR 220 000.
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway in the next year.
In particular, the safety of railway crossings is to be increased - throughout nationGermany, there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the communities agree to the reconstruction, they have to contribute with a third in the costs, while the rest share the railways and the Confederation.
Schiltach ’ s city builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the pecpeculiarities of the Bahcrossing of Am Hirschen.
There the city also plans to build a reserve at the height of the tunnel munde to the west of the railway line.
Larger vehicles, for example, those transporting long timber, could also stand in counter traffic without having to block the tracks.
Greeks therefore proposed that a necessary supporting wall be constructed so that the city could widen the subsequent road in time to ensure smooth traffic flow.
This was controversial controversial in the local council, because some councils questioned about the need for road proliferation: Thomas Kipp, in saying,, summed up the mood of the critics:' Do we have to take so much money into the because of so few vehicles?'
Mayor Thomas Haas objected that the railway " Hirschen " crossing is regularly used for transporting Langholts.
Even wood from the " Kuhbach bach " area is partly transported via this route, because the vehicles are up to 20 metres long would not be able to use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn there into the main road.
Moreover, the route served as a transfer for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed.
Since it should be expected that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels need to be renovated and reconstructed, as is the case at present in Wolfach, the railway crossing " Am " Hirschen " could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to have an investigation into the cost of the planned expansion of the road.
Despite this the majority agreed to the reconstruction of the railway crossing with the condition that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city could extend the following road in the direction of " Bahnhofstraße " to approximately 5.5 meters for meeting traffic.
However, the reconstruction of the railway crossing at Gerberei Trautwein could cause a quite different problem concerning access to the rapidly rising " Geroltzhäuser Weg ".
The administration had had the railway's conversion plans examined by the engineering office Breinlinger because it had doubts about whether the planned connection to the Geroltzhäuser Wegs was easily possible.
The investigation concluded that it should not be ruled out that road inclination could lead to longer vehicles being locked up.
The city, in turn, bears responsibility for this as a road-load carrier.
The rebuilding could, therefore, lead to conflicts of liability.
Since both wood removal and bending worked in the current state of construction, one should not agree to rebuild the railway crossing, Haas argued.
Also, the risk of a collision of the train, with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than on the other railway crossings, because it is directly next to the middle stop point to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the central railway station should be slowed down so that there is no risk of collision.
A majority of people were refused to the reconstruction of this railway crossing because the city of Schiltach ach would have to' up' the problem of suspended vehicles, according to the councils, because the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction has been completed.
The panel regards the conversions at the railway crossings " Vor Heubach " and " Vor Kuhbach " as unproblematic, for which crossing agreements have already been made with rail.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions.
Far planets, waves of gravity, or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to launch over the next few years.
30 suggestions have been selected and five are still in the race.
Far.
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets in other stars.
No one knows whether there are lives on at least some of them.
The choice is difficult: should you search for waves of gravitation?
Or explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or look for the earth-like planets and perhaps discover extra-alien life?
These questions are being asked by the leaders of the European Space Agency Esa.
For their " Cosmic Vision " programme they are seeking ideas for two major space projects that will to a decisive advance in research.
The budget for such " L missions " is about one billion euros.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were under discussion, five of which have now been closely selected.
Many bodies examine the proposals and catch up with researchers.
A final decision is to be taken in the next few days by the scientific programme committee.
The Esa has selected four major questions to find answers to the missions of the " Cosmic Vision " programme launched in 2007.
What are the conditions for planets and life?
The precise processes involved in creating stars from large gas clouds - and thus the emergence of planets that circle these stars - are still in proverbial darkness.
A large, infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can life arise there?
To investigate this question, in 2017 we will launch the Cheops space teltelescope, which will examine 500 known planetary systems closer to our vicinity.
But the possibilities are limited. Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map earth-like planets, even analyzing the composition of their atmospheres, looking for " biomarkers ": gases regarded as indicators of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately shed light on the conditions for the creation of life.
The magnetic activity of a star plays an important role and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle particle radiation that it emates with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined in an exemplary manner.
With the Solar Orbiter, the Esa has already approved a M-class mission to this issue (where the budget is about half a billion euros).
The probe is to start in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to the explorer.
They want to find out the role that the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this, the Esa provides for the first of the total three L missions of the " Cosmic Vision " programme.
The probe " Juice " (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to journey in 2022.
Eight years later, she reached Jupiter and was supposed to investigate the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
Worldspace offers many opportunities to study the matter under extreme conditions to examine whether the laws of nature that we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could show the physicists the way to a new theory, under which they can unite all the known laws of nature.
How did the universe evolve, and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos emerged from the big bang.
In addition to common matter consisting comprising stars, planets, and creatures like us, there is dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and cluster galaxies together, and Dark energy whose action accelerates the expansion of the universe.
So far, researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first moments of second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are.
With Euclid, the Esa has already approved an M mission, due to be launched in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions on the nature of Dark matter and Dark energy.
Whoever Race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many of the experts " E-Lisa ", the best chances of approval as an L-based mission have a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Physicists mean changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago.
To date, they have not been proved.
Elisa could succeed, scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides for a two or three probe detector stationed in space.
Unlike plants on the Earth, it could also detect gravitvitational waves created by the big bang, thereby providing new insights into the emergence of the cosmos.
Four other proposals compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " which is intended to explore black holes, " Icy's Planets ", another mission to the outer solar planets, " Prism ", a mission to measure the cosmic background, and the " Exoplanet's Finder ", to detect and investigate earth-like planet.
Proposals for the return of samples from Mars, research into the moon, Venus and asteroids and solar physics have already been rejected.
Snowden agrees to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence service's whistleblower, has declared that he is prepared to travel to Berlin and tell the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers to their activities.
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin by Ströbele on Friday, wrote: “ Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissent as a message of loyalty and seeks to help criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment in which no defense is possible. ”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
Snowden wrote in Snowden that he was convinced the international community's support could convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The US Department of Justice's prosecution includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Minister for Home Affairs, Hans-Peter Friedrich, said to time online: ‘ If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible. ’
US-US-German relations are plagued by claims that the NSA has interception ed Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of the parliamentary committee ’ s secret services, said that one should take the opportunity now to hear Snowden as a witness, if possible, “ without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US. ”
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists when he visited Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden, he leaves the country cannot return to Russia.
When Snowden says in Germany, he needs to have an assurance that he is “ safe, ” according says the honourable Member.
In his letter, Snowden declared that he was exposed to a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that had expelled him from his homeland.
It was, however,, touched, by the global response to “ my act of political expression. ”
Citizens around the world, and senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a public achievement.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities, “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ”.
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to request up to USD 100 from passengers holding hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand baggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if it in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep all whole can.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat and small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said that you will calculate $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 for travellers who paid only at the gate.
Front spokesman Kate O'Malley said that the fee of $100 is intended to move travellers to take care of payment in advance.
“ We don ’ t want to calculate this sum, ” she explained.
In 2008, airlines began charging charges for the first and second items of baggage.
Passengers trying to circumvent them have therefore thrown as much as possible into hand baggage, meaning that baggage bags above the seat are often overfilled.
Charges are one way of persuading passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money.
It is about Frontier's most loyal customers, who would have clearly stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a compartment above the seat.
Passengers who purchase their tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a piece of baggage at the Frontier boarding gate, but the next person has to pay $100 for a similar piece of baggage.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they came to the gate.
The new hand baggage fee from Frontier will only take effect in the summer; there is not yet an exact date.
Passengers often vaccinate about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines are happy to use them.
They argue that baggage transport should cost money and passengers should pay this service if they wish it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, have left fingers of charges for hand baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand baggage three years ago and later Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air, declared by the airline advisant, Jay Sorensen, who is following the additional charges closely.
In a report of December 2011, he estimated that Spirit hand baggage charges USD 50 million a year.
Sorensen, once once a leader at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the platform when passengers were facing the company ’ s unusual hand baggage charge.
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth I experienced in my career in aviation, ” he said.
I expected to see teeth craashing and handtangible discussions at the boarding gate.
“ The plane was full, ” he explained, “ and boarding was like lubricated. ”
Frontier also follows Spirit on the $2, required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice would keep all the whole can and that coffee would be filled free of charge.
Water remains free.
US Airways briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed it seven months later after passengers had complained and no other large company had followed suit.
Frontiers's move to impose hand baggage charges if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the most recent initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to encourage passengers to buy them directly rather than through an online travel agency.
But Frontier has gone furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, miles were again reduced to 25% of the route.
An air journey with Frontier over 1000 miles booked with a third party provider will therefore bring customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when purchasing directly on the Frontier Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal base in Denver, but business is contracting and the company is losing money.
Revenues fell by 9%, and flight capacity shrank by nearly 13% in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings, Inc.
Republic has tried to bring Frontier's finances under the control of the sale of society.
Words come from the Bible
More than 40 women visited the women's last breakfast this year in the Protestant church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the town hall was' proverb words from the Bible' and' words from the middle ages'.
Zita Köhler, the Chairman of the Church Municipal Council, referred to the biblical verwords in a speech after breakfast.
" Proverwords contain life directions, rules or warnings, " she explained.
She compared several proverwords with the corresponding bible places, and explained the meaning.
She called proverb like: wooden eyes is vigilant, as scales fall from the eyes, cast an eye on someone who gives himself to the Lord in sleep, wash his hands innoinnocent.
On several occasions, the speaker also advised her listeners what proverb it was.
The church parish wife Christel von Dehner adopted the words of the Middle Ages: all good three things are three, making blue, and aling things up.
She explained the importance and origin of what she called' bridges to the past'.
In conclusion, a raffle was raffled.
The prizes were covered on a table table and were humorously rewritten before they were given to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round, there was also mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unkilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry started startetheute at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unqualified people in the industry are to be qualified as skilled workers for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
" New is that the six-month courses end with degrees, " said Carmen Wiechechert of Neubrandenburg Employment Agency.
The benefits are varied: this would not make the participants unemployed, the firms would be well-trained workers, who were becoming increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project is supported by the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Catering Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA says that an “ internal error, ” not hackers, is to blame for the website crash.
The shadowy National Security Agency declared on late Friday that a mistake has paralyzed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as has been claimed online.
“ NSA.gov was unreachable for several hours this night because an internal error occurred during a planned update, ” explained the sponage agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be remedied this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is not true.
Online server trackers noticed early trackers that the NSA website was unreachable for at least six hours and this is still not for some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that its sensitive sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised.
Secret information is not at risk, according to the speaker.
At least one group of hackackers claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
For such attacks, the target website will be flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple, and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, whose nickname was No Such Agency, is now in the bright light of the public, faces heavy criticism of the revelations announced in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusionformer NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over intelligence fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of targeted cycle operation.
The number of people without jobs declined slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota is better at 3.1% than last previous year and is also better than in September, " we would have hoped for more, " says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy director of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far reacted gently when it comes to recruitment.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is " " We have hardly any professionals in the crafts, in health care and the care of the elderly ".
Due to the annual season, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been launched since September.
The winter season begins in the middle of December.

Bombardier ’ s loss of profits following a fall in supplies and orders
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer, Bombardier Inc., reported a 15% decline in net profit on Thursday after it had come under pressure from declining orders and deliveries for third quarter aircraft and contract problems in the railway sector.
The new Montreal Montreal Bombardier did not publish test data for his brand-new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any information as to whether the aircraft could go into commercial use according to the ambitious timetable next September.
So far only three more launches on the maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago, which makes it difficult to question whether the test phase is running as planned.
The results fell short of the forecasts and led to a price fall of more than 8% on the Toronto stock exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating from “ outperform ” to “ sector perform on Thursday so that the stock had limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
“ Although weaker deliveries were expected to be expected for aircraft, we are clearly disappointed by the margins in the transport sector, ” said Doerksen sen a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries if the aircraft test programme progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment, currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew first in September after months of delays.
But so far binding orders orders are moderate for CSeries at 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to see whether the company ’ s claims about the fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new jet jet aircraft are correct.
At the moment there are a total of 403 orders and pledges from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve his target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
The company ’ s management also gave assurance to analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was included in the schedule.
“ The test aircraft has no longer remained on the ground than expected, ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that ground tests and software updates were scheduled to be place during the life of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer is planning differently.
We have decided to make a first flight and then to attach a review period, which is what we have done.
This happens throughout the flight programme.
The second out of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest shortly after, the company said.
However, analysts remain sceptical about whether the first customer is able to operate a CSeries aircraft operational 12 months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier explained that it reviewed the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“ The slow progress of the flight test – although it obviously corresponds to Bombardi ’ s internal planning – confirms our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015, ” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, at the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share of $172 million or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents.
Sales fell slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
Net orders decreased from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order book in the aerospace sector was $32.9 billion on 30 September, and was thus unchanged compared to 31 December.
“ In the aerospace sector, results were within our targets, but low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing, ” said Beaudoin.
Revenues in the aerospace sector fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have increased by just under 11% to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on September 30, and thus increased slightly slightly compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the area of transport has been affected by settlement problems for some major contracts.
According to the company ’ s management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In Thursday's aftertrading, the bardi's share decreased by 8.5%, and was $4.83 Canadian dollars after being announced that Google Financial CEO Patrick Pichette will change to the Board.
Brazil ’ Embraer SA, the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier ’ s closest rival, reported a 10% decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday.

Cocae-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must be put in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information to sub-world size Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer was afraid that his covert drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of major police investigation for afraid that his secret drug addiction could be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided sub-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into his activities in the drug trade after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
Criminals ’ praise as a “ first class ” lawyer nicknamed “ Bash ” was arrested in his house in 2011 after police monitored Scarcarborough, whom he represented in a previous drug case.
Officials saw Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn (Lancashire), while he was with colleagues at a dinner at the bar.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet, and credit cards.
Over an eight month period between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were monitored by the police at the time of a major investigation into the heroin cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and £200,000 in cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be publicised.
Today DDitta, working for the Forbes Soliclicitors firm in Blackburn, was found guilty and sentted at the Liverpool ol Crown wn Court following a three-week trial in two charges for obstruction ting justice.
He admitted ownership of cocaine at an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found in their investigation into Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house where drugs were placed under the lawyer's bin bin with a purity of 60% in a black golf glove.
Shortly after supplying the drugs, Scarborborough regularly called Ditta who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
The court revealed that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after Class A tests discovered Class A drugs in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocacaine, saying that he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that that her discussion was to “ lawyers ’ secrecy. ”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and he was taken a hair sample.
During police interrogation, he stated that, both at his private address and in the workplace, an office and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
Court revealed that he had called on key players in drug trafficking, some of those whom he had previously represented, for significant arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you are not breaking the law. ”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker who supplies drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these people.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He was forward to the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta rejected any wrongs and asserclaimed, “ If I were a very corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to give information to Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours but do it immediately. ”
But, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead from the police in Lancashire said, “ Mr. Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal the moment he started to purchase drugs from organized criminals. ”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organised crime, who instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and public confidence and confidence.
Ditta evaded that trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and imppediment, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that nobody can escape the arm of the law.
We find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison, guilty of conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five others involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself, where he claimed that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the end of the celebrations of its 160-anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will enframe two religious services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life ", which fascinated the audience in spring spring this year Liederkranz will, at the end of the anniversary year will enrich two religious services with the performance of the German trade fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair in St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. at church service in the St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Gesänge zur Feier des Feier des heiliges Opfers der Messe ", D 872, is a spiritual music work by the composer Franz Schubert dating from 1826 and was regarded as almost revolutionary at the time of birth.
The exhibition is performed in the context of religious services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied on the organ by the brass group of the members of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi.
Haslach – Skepticism is softening in confidence
The 2015 elections to the parish council council will bring fundamental changes in, for example, the Hashalach (SE) spiritual care unit.
There will then only be one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Indeed, the fundamental decisions of the diocesese can no longer be, and it is up to the parish councils to implement as satisfactorily as possible.
It became particularly clear during the day: skepticism about the new is hesitant but increasingly less confident.
The extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the maritime team range from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council.
Regional dekan Georg Schmitt explained, by means of a presentation, the reclassified guidelines for the spiritual care units in the archdiocese of Freiburg.
Subsequently, the SE of Haslach, as a parish community, will in future form a body of public law that will into the rights and duties of the hitherto six individual church communities.
There will only be a common parish council and a board of foundations, in which the pastor Kraft is represented.
At least two elected members should be represented from each parish, in six parishes, so-called so-called community teams are formed on site.
In future, their task will be to promote church life in the village.
There was then a considerable need for discussion about the finances of the individual parish parish.
The new features mean that accumulated funds will be kept in the parishes.
By contrast, liabilities pass to the entire community.
There have been major concerns, particularly with regard to the major planned investments, the commitment of which will hit all the fares.
" Even in the past, investment was only invested in projects that could be managed by the individual parish alone, ", relatified Haslach ’ s parish president, Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chair of the board in the board of the welfare unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They set themselves a task in 2006 to' become one, to stay five' and found out that it is not that easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher unit of care unit then decided to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council, as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The work will be finalised in further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six fora next spring.
In the end the parish parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the welfare unit which was approved by a clear majority.
Electricity becomes more expensive in Pfullendorf
The citizens of Pfullendorfs must prepare for higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to SÜDKURIER, a four-headed Pfulllendorfer family will from 70 to 90 additional costs per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This levy is refixed every year in October by the four operators of the major power routes.
These estimate the additional costs arising from the change of energy, which they can impose through a levy over the price of electricity.
Pfullendorf city works form the last link in this chain.
The Energy Company ’ s Supervisory Board had even based its predictions on a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the actual figures would have to be calculated before the city works next week could inform their customers about the exact increase in the price.
" We expect to increase 1 cent plus x, " says bias, although the number will be more close to 2 cents.
Amplight on continual red: Pay attention to Waiting
Sometimes, a traffic light simply does not turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should we do, then - driving at red?
If a concerned has waited long enough for a red traffic light and the intersection is free, he can go on, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad ".
The waiting time, however, must be' reasonable', which can be interpreted in different ways from case to case.
Becker advises to stay for at least five minutes before it is assumed that the traffic lights are malfunction.
If you continue the journey in spite of red light, however, you must be aware that they are fully responsible for an accident.
Those who tolerate for less than five minutes may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision by the Highland Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes of continuous red a driver had ignored the traffic lights and had to answer responsibility for a negligent red light breach.
The traffic light was not broken, but jumped to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but the fine was not.
The Community Council welcomes a sound budget
Whenever local council meetings discuss the budget, mayor Ralph Gerster has laugh well.
The municipal bakery in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not been known with the administration since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be regarded as a complete success.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund pointed out, the administrative budget was about EUR 1 million higher than was planned, at around EUR 7.6 million.
The surplus of the administrative budget would also be around EUR 1 million above the approach, at around EUR 1.8 million.
The surplus is mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the community ’ s share of income tax.
The wealth budget, too, was again markedly higher than the planned values.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million proposed last year, it was EUR 2.5 million.
" This is essentially due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget ", says Rothmund.
Since fewer investments were made than planned in the 2012 financial year, reserve allocation has also been higher.
In total, the overall reserve has been increased by around EUR 2.1 million to the current total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
" Such a work is not simply shaken out of the sleeve, " Gerster praised with regard to the annual accounts.
He and the local councils were obviously pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but these good figures could soon be costly for the citizens.
Due to its good financial position, the community could do without high leverage in the past.
According to Gerster, however, this in turn has often reduced subsidies from the country.
There are prerequisites for these subsidies from various compensatory levels.
Among other things, the cities and communities applying for grants must have certain leverage.
" We have to look at the issue of leverage, because there are investments investments we like to see subsidies for in the coming years, " GerGerster announced this this.

Kenya ’ s press outraged by the controversial Media Law
‘ We are in a worrying situation and one may ask: what does Parliament prevent Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow? ’, was read in the newspaper that regards the draft law as unconstitutional.
“ The law is draconian and criminal and we reject it, ” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya ’ s most prestigious independent radio and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased because it is an extended arm of government, ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy.
“ I hope the President stens to us and we appeal on him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament, ” he said.
According to The Star, the new law effectively “ “ effectively effectively a stranglehold on the media. ” The Standard writes that democracy, and freedom of speech in Kenya have “ suffered a severe blow, ” describing the draft as “ draconian. ”
The adoption of the law is one of a series of measures to strengthen national security following the armed Islamist attacks on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
The Kenyan media took bed the authorities ’ wrath by publishing shots of the security cameras showing how units sent to the scene were allegedly robbed by the luxurious shopping mall.
Political chief David Kimaiyo responded to interrogation by appointing two journalists and a leading media representative, even though the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry.
The new law allows media houses to punish up to 20 million of Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “ a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankrupt. ”
Moreover, the newspaper believes these measures could have a devastating impact on what it describes as Kenya ’ s “ vibrant blogosphere. ”
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
“ No one will ever experience, ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at the nation, who describes the Kenyan media as a crucial factor of control in public life.
“ Leave politicians to themselves, lead the country into bankruptcy and bring us back to the time of hunters and collectors, ” he said.
Kenya ’ s legislators have previously incited public anger.
In May, they agreed to reverse the cuts imposed by the National uneration Commission and reinstate their defective salaries of around 532,000 ,000 chillings duty-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream for the FC
Despite the importance for the city and the football club, the official inauguration ceremony for the Kunstras sports ground lost nothing despite the cold weather and the rain.
Everyone all wished for a more pleasant party last Saturday, but Peter Peter did not want to play it.
This was the oversight of all those who came without a umbrella or who were unable to keep such one for any reason.
This was done to the musicians who framed the festivities, as well as to many speakers.
So FC Chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of fulfilling a dream, was never made either.
His thanks were due primarily to mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the local council, the companies involved and the association members who took in.
Especially especially Lothar Ho, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty pensioners laid 400 square metres of pavestones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by MEP Karl Rombach.
Further greetings went to the urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South German football association, Kuno Kayan and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office who announced a donation to the club's youth department.
Mayor, Klumpp, remembered that recurring wether-related influences in the spring and autumn put to the original lawn site so it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first thoughts on solving the problem when it was to build a third place on the grounds of the football club or at the primary school on the Salinensee.
Both have been rejected again.
Six years ago, ideas were raised about setting up an artificial grass grass sports ground, which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were made two years ago, when the FC took over the cabinet in hertlerent, promised a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for construction ting the place and when the country approved funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the local Council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 at the total cost of EUR 560 000, compumped up Klumpp.
The construction of the Kunstrasenplatz, measuring 68 times 108 metres, took place on June 4.
During the over three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic metre of earth were taken away, half of which was used to build a Dirt bike track.

On the subject of transport, which is not included on the agenda this Friday, the SPD has med its' no' to car tolls demanded by the CSU.
A vignette was a " flat rate for multiple driving and is thus ecologically counterproductive " explained the SPD negotiator on the subject of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There were threatened with divergent traffic on rural roads, which are already focal points for accidents.
Moreover, from Pronold's perspective, the introduction of a toll for all cars would only be a first step.
" There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later stage, " he said.

An overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan nutrition requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk, and dairy products.
Pumped tofu with plant flag, for example, is a quarker substitution.
The Vegetarian Confederation also describes as the World Year's Day on November 1.
On the occasion of World Day on 1 November, the Vegetarian Confederation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, replacing yoghurt with soyyoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Beatable plant frame replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also vegetable alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
There are also 50 grams of an apple or a tablespoon ground linen seeds plus three tablespoons of water.
Loocker are dough instead of egg for example with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of thickness and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But 50 grams of soyyoghurt or silk ofu can also serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800 000 people in Germany are eating vegan, in other words purely plantant.
New York sleeps
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest high school met the large American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight we went to BroBrooklyn Bridge, walking distance to the heart of the city, Manhattan.
It already offered a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in evening light.
The time shift left the students on their feet almost 24 hours, but faithful to the motto " The City Not Sleep " the day was decided at Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, the Statue of Liberty was reached on the second day by a ferry and was catached on foot.
It then went to Wall Street financial center for the memorial of September 11.

The group of horn bands of the hunting group Westfalen, led by BriBrigitte Kluth, plays on choirs (nature in in mood mood) following old, originally French melodies.
The blades wear riding clothing because they mainly accompany musically ririders, horses and dog deodydes on trawls.
The solemn fair will take place on Sunday, 3rd of November, at 11.30 am.
The newly designed opening shines with a new café.
One thing that invites you to linger and come back.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to Lexicon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon expressed in the feeling we have already experienced or seen a new situation.
In case case visiting the cafe of the same name at the top stop in the district town of Kleve, within walking distance of the Rhine-Waal University, it does not have to remain the pure " Déjà Vu feeling.
The aim of the café with its beautiful name is precisely that: to make a real stay unforgetable not only in mind, but also permanently by hand.
Because it is fun and simply beautiful.
A look into the interior at Opke 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at once.
The ultra-modern, but not cool café-ambience looks like a place to feel at ease.
Here the team spoils the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner with various coffee or cocktail variants by Daniel Büttner.
In addition, there are delicious cakes or individually selected fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves before the opening of the charming cafe at the Opschlag as gastronomrestaurants: they led the " Art Lounge " in Kranenburg.
From the move to Kleve, the friendly café lovers are hoping for more audiences from Kleve to the opschlag.
Last but not least, through the university.
" We do not have a specific target group " says Daniel Büttner.
Instead, the two want to address young students as well as senior citizens and all age classes in between.
Speaking of cafe lovers.
The friendly couple of owners stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot blower yourself in a wide variety of variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the express fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
" To do a baguette - that is my thing ", she explains to the NRZ.
Two events have already taken place in the bright cafe.
Better to say one.
After all, the port festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit ited from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
" Beautiful, successful and funny ", the two 33-year-olds found.
But it is not everyone's business.
Perhaps that is why Daniel Büttner is not a great fan of event evenings: " You can't get everyone right'.
And with an event I always address those who are interested in the special event.
That is why events will be the exception for us.
" We want to disrupt normal operation as little as possible ".
In other words, Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful surroundings at the opening ke in Kleve.
The road, which is becoming more and more developed into a piece of gastronomy.
To the delight of many Klevers, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus the Café Déjà Vu.

UN proclaims New Poverty Goals
The United Nations is now starting to develop a series of new objectives designed to replace the Millennium Development Goals to combat poverty, announced 12 years ago.
Ahead up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit that began in Rio de Janeiro this evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals that expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document adopted at the summit by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated at the summit in the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests. ”
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to begin a process that aims to reconcile universal, sustainable development goals, ” he said.
“ These goals will build on our progress in the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the member states to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals, which are built on the success of the Millennium Goals. ”
Although the SG AchAchim / Baden has been without victory for four days days, the Handball Oberligist is still in good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves absolutely no doubt about this.
Everyone continues to be fully motivated.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
" Because I don't know what such a victory tastes like, " Malmon expects a experience of success from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third League reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet pulled out trees, Malmon raises the pointing finger in advance with a warning.
Many players have still trained myself in the A-youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
" Moreover, we have to wait if there will be reinforcement from the first, " explains the SG Coach.
To finally get back to the track track, the Malmon team must at least rate increase up compared to the previous performances.
Above all, the last problem was enormous in the cover work and the switching game.
The use of opportunities also definitely needs to be improved.
So I hope that my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president of Mozambique, to agree to calls for peace at a rare public demonstration.
“ We want peace again, we want stability, ” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt bearing the label “ We call for security ” in Portuguese, and which she has joined the crowd on the independence square of the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-led Rhodesia and later South Africa ’ s apartheid government, in effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts find the country unlikely to revert to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have disturbed foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of vast gas reserves off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring US investment of more than $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Italian Eni, and Anadarko over the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo Party has been the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by on 17 October attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghof Renamos.
The incursions on the former rebels, which escalated when government forces attacked Renama bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group ’ s leader, explained RenRenamos ’ spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organisation of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
In response to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a “ loser, ” who wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government. ”
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
However, the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted in the words that Renamo is giving the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT, so he meant that Frelimo no longer respect the agreement.
“ Our vision is to reopen negotiations and do so seriously, ” said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties did little to resolve the tensions fueled by a number of clashes this year.
“ We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are ump their heads together, ” says Joseph Hanlon, leclecturer at Open University and an expert in Mozambiambique.
None of them is good in negotiation and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pressing for electoral reform, has already said that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos's election success has shrunk since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM) founded by a former Renama member, will likely improve in elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy.
“ He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up presidency, ” said Mazanga.
Renamo ’ s capabilities is not clear, but it has made troublesome attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South link.
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but home is Beira, using the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously in asking whether Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique, ” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of abductions.
“ People think that the government and president are responsible for the future of the country and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems, ” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people simply wanted stability.
“ No interest in Renamo and Frelimo, they simply want peace and useable roads again, ” he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ role models for life, ” an author says.
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks, ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
But many of the myths are “ far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools, ” so Crossley-Holland argued for a “ careful selection ” of works of old age.
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America, ” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that those who are “ overly didactic ” among authors and teachers would have “ completely shut off ” children, because the messages would be “ subliminal ” in entertaining stories.
Crossley Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon as author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Valley, said: “ You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background. ”
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children lies in the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
It must be subliminal, through which history has revealed and not explained.
This is the old story of showing rather than counting.
Hansjakob returns to Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob took his retirement retirement in Haslach; on Sunday, his last years came alive in the " Freihof ".

Haslach ’ s mayor Heinz WinWinkler gave himself the honour of granting the honorary citizen, who made his announcement in behalf of the then official holder, Hätch, together with a part of the local city council.
Their waiting was followed by the Tri-King singer who led Hansjakob to say: " Oh as good, there are youth memories alive to my own Trikal time ".
With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentage children with their loud " Heraus, Heraus ".
Hansjakob expressed his criticism of the Official Church at the time, as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
He found his place of rest in the hometown, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten.
" A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever, " he said at the end of the scene game.
There was much applause and much praise from the audience for the performance.

Shrill Piepsen Disrupts dwellers
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the shelf.
The company has several iron in the fire at the site.
Apart the carbonate port, Rhenus Midgard uses, among other things, wind plant logistics.
Black shims the coal on the storage area in front of the dikes.
Spread two massive blue half-shake and back-chargers here or load the coal as required.
With every movement of the handling equipment, a shriwarning sound blows over the ground.
" The signals serve safety and are required by law, " says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, with unfavourable standing wind, this is widely heard - and there have been some complaints from the town of town already.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old person.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quiet with technical measures.
He continues to count on an open dialogue with his neighbours.
Matthias Schrell still has a few things in front of the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on carbonate transport for power plants and is one of Europe's biggest in this sector.
Thanks to the extended width of 18.5 metres in front of the terminal, capesize-bulk carriers can now be processed here.
" This year we want to crack the 3 million ton mark at the envelope, " says Schrell.
In addition to the local Eon power station, imported coal is going to inland power stations.
When the GDF Suez power station goes to the grid, no more than 5 million tonnes of carbonisation annually would be realistic.
The three ship-loaders on the bridge and the second line of transport could create up to 10 million.

Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variable artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre at Broadway, Broadway, began to tell the crowd about direct jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays's innovation has been expanded, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of CarolCarolines stand-up institution, the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“ Most of these headliners began at Carolines and then became ever more successful until they were eventually known to perform in a club, ” said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year ’ s event features appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “ Stand Up for Heroes ”, an annual music and comedy benefit event for army fans in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The world of comedy has also grown with the festival.
A number of the comedians attending the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as programmes on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic ically y fantasy Football series “ The League ” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast both “ Saturday Night Live ” and “ Parks and Recreation ”, although she is best known for her viral video series “ Marcel the Shell with Shoes On ”.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic racial centfocused W. Kaumau Bell) are products out of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest magnets of visitors to the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a TV entitled “ Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg ” at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
" The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work, " said Steinberg.
He told me that when he is here, he sometimes goes through the lanley between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all of my money, then I may live here.
Iran Satisfied with the Nuclear NegotiProcess
A week before the next nuclear meeting, Iran is satisfied with the five UN veto powers and Germany is satisfied with the negotiation process.
" After years, there is now an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Energy Agency to resolve the the differences that exist in recent years, " Foreign Minister Mohammed Dashawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that both sides will end up with a solution.
Uruguay Drama: Killing Playrooms with Machete
Two children admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 years old boys invited their victims to go on bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they met the 11-year old on Tuesday and threw the body into a fountain, reported the newspaper " El País " on Thursday.
They would then have played soccer in front of their homes in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found on the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
The alibi was to tell a five-year half-sister of the young man who had taken her with her that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the daily routine in front of the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the eleven year old.
As a reason, the elderly called, among others, a rivalry in the football match.
He was provisionally admitted to a psychiatric youth institution.
Pimps in Jail
The Regional Court Konstance stance has sentenced a 33-year-old year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in jail for exploitative trafficking in human human beings, ppimping, a threat, insulting and dangerous corporly injury.
The former German military soldier, who worked as a dooror after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial.
So in five five cases he has met women via Internet or telephone contacts, whom he sent after a few weeks against their will.
Resistance he used to break with violence and threats.
He retained the income of women, some of whom worked for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undermined women's contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
The first part of the war was fought by the end of both the end of the end of the war, and the end of Iraq was destroyed at the end of the war.
In court, the accused initially claimed that he suffered from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert suggested grave doubts about mental constraint and thus limited debt, the 333-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to hear any of the injured women.
As a Crio official reported, after an initial announcement made by telephone monitoring measures, at least four more cases of exploitative people-trafficking could be identified.
The talks that were heard were marked by great aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women discovered blue spots on the whole body, has not made any statement to this day.
It is a question of' a completely broken personality', who considers violence and exploitation in it to be normal.
The defendant regretted how he behaved yesterday.
" He separated himself from these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after detention, " he said.
The price of oil continues to give up to USD 96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference wood for deliveries in December had fallen in electronic commerce in Europe in the late morning on the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, representing a price drop of 5.8% in October.
The large supply of raw oil has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The US Energy Department declared on Wednesday that US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supply increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was evidence of increased demand from two reports of increased activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This suggests a continued recovery of China ’ s economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8% in the third quarter, after reaching the lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil from the Brent, a reference value for international crude de oil also used by US refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel.
The Court is blocking the NYPD ’ s Stop and Risk Decision
A Federal Appeal Court in the US on Thursday blocked the order of a judge who called for changes to the stop and risk (“ stop stop ”) of the New York Police Department, and dised the judge from the case.
The 2nd US Appeal Court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin were suspended until an appeal to the city was decided.
The judge ruled in the August that the city was violating the Constitution with the way in which the holding and questioning programme was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the ordered remedies, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its directive and the relevant training programme.
The Court of Appeal on Tuesday heard the arguments for the requested suspension.
The appeal report asserout that the judge had to be released from the case, because she she breached the code of conduct for US judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she responded publicly to the court ’ s criticism.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were unappropriately targeting black and Latin American men with the Stop and Risk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision and ordered a pilot programme with body-supported cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to terminate the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were re-released by the police police.
An oral negotiation on the appeal of the city is planned after March 14, 2014.
The stop and risk tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights advocates.
Checks of this kind have existed in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of the partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time level of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, an action was brought by four men belonging to all minorities that developed into a collective lawsuit.
Advocates of changes to the NYPD's stop and risk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and more effective police force, and influence the way other police presiidents use the scheme.
Opponents believe that the changes would cushion the police morality but not crime; nor would money wasted or solve the broader problem of a police that is under pressure after thousands of jobs were lost in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop and risk-practice, which is constitutional, but only reform the way in which controls are implemented by NYPD.
The Happiness of Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that achieves only dreaming camels.
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association " Helfende Hände ".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which has already had considerable successes.
The first chairman, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajedj hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and the gynaaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on the ground on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the interventions were shown on a large screen, so the guests of the anniversary event could get an idea of the aforementioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former federal border vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former Nagold of Nagold, proposed to provide this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, plans to play an advisory role with the association.
In 2008, the Zimmerehei Schleeh from Baiersbronn set up the hospital station in Socogim, an Elendsviertel on the outskirts of the capital, in a record time of almost a week.
Henne also mentioned a new Mother-Child Hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be egrationalized in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, says Henne, for example deprivation against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was impossible to make as many trips as planned, but many medical professionals came to Germany to host here in various areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, as in March of this year, medical equipment, medicines, association material, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles being converted to a mobile brick hall, and describing the experiences experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association during their trip to Mauritania.
He described his personal motives as his work on auditing as a young MEP.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a popular budget.
Fuchtel also stressed that the global economy also demands global human love.
Nor should it be borne in mind that Africa is nearer than some think.
It is not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check tips.
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “ telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip about an affair of then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in the Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special advisor ” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire private detaire to hack Pawlly's voice emails and prosecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court learned.
“ According to the prosecutor, Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, is nobody standing in front of people ’ homes and hopes to catch them on fresh action, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their response, ” Edis explained.
He said that NotW uses three procedures for researching stories investigatively: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the monitoring, it cannot be otherwise.
What about the first?
Does he know phone hacking?
He denies that, but we say, “ And whether he knew about it. ”
Rumours about a Clarkes affair were first picked up by NotW ’ s feature editors when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was said, “ Do not waste your time, it is associated with Charles. ”
A band with voice emails from their phone on at least three occasions was seiured in Mulcaires apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as " projects ".
During the time the research ran, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking them for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Pawlby movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail saying: “ I have a story that we want to publish tomorrow, which I would like to discuss with Charles. ”
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story have followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman because of an affair, when he himself liated to the co-accused Rebekah of Brooks who was married.
Coulson and Brooks dispute to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted telephone hacking.
In protest against the planned Reichensteuer, the French football will, in fact, go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting will come to an end without results.
In the conflict over the wealth tax, the government and the professional football in France have manoeuvred themselves into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
Although President François Hollande received club and association representatives and heard their complaints on Thursday at the Élysée Palace in Paris.
However, he refused to spare t football from the planned 75% levy on income of more than EUR 1 million per year, which all the country ’ s companies would pay for two years from 2014.
The other side, too, remained tough.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be carried through, telling the club's chief association of professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The match days of Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, scheduled between November 29th and 2nd December, fall out.
Gechingen: Total Protection
" We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning early on ", mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens c information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the measures that were planned, to ask questions, express concerns and submit ideas.
Häußler made it clear:' The final decisions are taken by the members of the municipal council'.
The floods that hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009, unprepared, had been a major event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, according to Häußler.
A river area survey was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
" The protection of as many plots as possible is the goal, " says Häußler.
The planning of the protection is planned against a flooding that can be expected, according to German Meteological Service statistically every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In professional circles, this is referred to as " HQ 100aKlima ".
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 were equivalent to 1000 years of flooding.
" There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement ", says Häußler.
In order to achieve the HQ 100aClimate protection, around EUR 4 million will have to be invested in Gechingen, and the municipality can count on a state grant of around 70 percent.
However, Häußler pointed out that support will only exist if an overall concept is implemented.
For this, the community needs the participation of the citizens.
An extensive planning and approval procedure needs to be carried out.
In the best case, implementation can be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was presented in the Local Council last week (we reported), makes provision for local measures in the inflow of the Irish river from the Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants took the opportunity to raise their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and retention basins were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, technical planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all presented measures in order to achieve the desired goal.
Moreover, the most economical solution is to be found, according to Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Discontent prevailed among residents on the altor, who repeatedly suffer from overload of the channel network, even during normal ththunder rain.
The problem is known in administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems were different than for flood protection, and this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be dealt with.
Larger the sewage channels would devour millions.
Serious injured after Clash
On Friday early afternoon, on the provincial road 44 near Revensdorf, two car drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but initially could not say much about the outcome of the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that need to be evaluated in the first place.
It is clear that the 19-year-old steer of a VW golf went to Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collapsed, with the woman being so heavily trapped that the fire department took just under half an hour to get her out of the vehicle scrap.
The real cause of the accident was at first left unresolved.
Both of these accidents went to nearby hospitals.
The track remained fully locked for about two hours.
He could be called the US Dostoyevsky.
Philip K. Dick was a sefiner of God, a metaphysician, his novels and narratives also have something serious.
Apuzzing the kinship in the exterior: the stibling eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski ’ s massive oeuvre can be understood as the founder and apologet of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who is something in his own home.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with its 118 narratives distributes Zweitausendeins.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress combined with paranoia, security madness, and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of John ’ s revelation and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, drugs had been added to his brains.
He realized, early on, that the computers are divinity.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a human from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That is the Blade Runner problem.
Killing.
Master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now a particularly significant one.
The " Minority Report " dates from 1956, exuating the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
The principle of' pre-crime' is being developed,' pre-crime', in other words, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In a thick world that is rifingly like ours, mutants look to the future - and the police are taking.
" We capture individuals who have not violated any law, " says the head of the authority.
" We snap them before they can commit a violent crime.
And: " There are no serious criminals in our society, for which we have a criminal camp full of pesudo criminals " and read streams of time.
They assume that something things is wrong and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Thick narrative looks like the blueprint for the anti-terrorist laws and the witapping of the NSA.
Anticipating the attack: This is the way that Obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dicick's story is not yet over.
The head of the police complains that there is no longer a separation of powers, that the military controls day-to-everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor himself will be supervised and transferred to a future crime.
The system rotates.
It is perfect, but it lies.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Not only does it take on mistakes and victims, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger that it is fighting against.
Reading Philip K. Dick means coming closer to the truth.
Spears about Merkel in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also comment on his Russian asylum in the US late affair surrounding German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Bar utor could either ask questions in writing or also meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, reported the agency Interfax.
Before viously, Hans-Christian Ströbele, who was the first German politician, met Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations heighten corporate paranoia on account of state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt / Main, the financial capital of Germany.
instructed by the German Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Comunter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Internal Security Service, he should photograph the roof of the US foreign post, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of antennas and the action led to a exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US did not use opportunities for foreign espionage “ to steal foreign business secrets on behalf of US companies, so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profits. ”
But, since Edward Snowden, the former Whistleblower, began to publish his horn of US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director at the word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency spy the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud vendors, including Google and Yahoo, have corporate paranoia to a new peak for state surveillance.
The torrel overproduced the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone was wounded, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then corporate management will certainly also be potential goals.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
“ Germany must wake up, ” explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now posed almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, in a survey published by the consulting firm EY in July.
But the documents leaked through by Snowden have not no evidence that the US has transferred the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU should lack certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are sceptical here.
It was suggested in the Bundestag that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“ This is not how it works, ” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If we had wished for a strong European IT industry, then we should not have allowed it to extinct 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except for IT.
Nevertheless, the scope and technical sophistication of the US spy authorities exposed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest risk of spyage in China.
Cloud computing changes clcloud computing, because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurisdiction there and therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the ClCloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, more about 10% of non-US-based members, according to revelations about US data mining activities with Prism, rejected plans to use an American vendor.
Jim Snabe, deputy CEO of SAP, says this: “ We see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago – it says: where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that they physically remain in this legal space? ”
Many German business leaders take the view that the latest reports simply confirm what what already knew anyway, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be guarded at all costs.
It is no surprise that economic espionage is taking place.
That has always been the case.
“ It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally as a result of the current discussion, ” says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy us in commercial and industrial terms, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
They do not usually boast about the countermeasures they have taken, because this brings benefits to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been persuaded that the inclusion of a free USB sticks at a fair or the unattended vised leaving of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of Audi AuAudi, says that it has been standard practice practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a meeting of directors, so that they cannot be used as intercapping devices.
The German BVT advises managers to use simple prepaid mobile phones when they travel abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid mobile phones are thrown away afterwards.
There is a concern, however, that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niche.
“ Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, the staff and the financial resources in order to protect business secrets effectively against unauthorised access, ” warns the BVT in a report.
The US warns its own firms of economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia, and Israel were ranked behind China behind two of the countries used to obtain economic data from hacking.
A member of the board of directors of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, “ the French are the worst. ”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence service DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month: “ The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even when operating in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies. ”

The investigators of the Lowndes County Sheriff ’ s crew concluded that Johnson had died in a tragic accident, but this was no doubt to the 17-year-old family.
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered, ” said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
They had never believed that he had died as the Sheriff had concluded.
“ They believe that it has no logic to violate the laws of physics as well as common sense, ” said Crump.
Instead, they are convinced that the truth is being covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“ Her son went to school to learn and came back in the body bag, ” he comments.
US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death because a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What caused death?
Is his death attributable to a crime?
Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction.
My aim is to find out the truth.
“ I take the view that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation, ” he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy suggested that Johnson died of the consequences of “ position-related suffocation. ”
A second autopsy, however, caused a different cause, according to Moore.
“ There are a number of questions to be answered or confirmed, ” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation relating to Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff Authority was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities must release all the surveillance videos checked by the investigators.
The teenager's parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained information on how he died.
CDC publish allergy policies for schools
On Wednesday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines that the US government has issued, as the number of schoolschool children with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools designed to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff, and how to deal with children, showing allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have an epepephrhrine – the epiPen brand car injection is most commonly used – to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
State legislators recently amended the rules to make schools easier to hold epinephrine.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “ It feels like something is ses on my tongue ”, “ My tongue feels as if a hair lies on it, ” or “ My tongue tongue cribles ”.
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ gender indeterminate ”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with unambiguous genitals.
Newborn are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents will no longer have to declare sex for such children, but will be able to state “ indefinite ” or “ not determined ” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to remove the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on newborn sexual assignment operations and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to the BBC, an intersexual person said years later, ‘ I am neither man nor woman. ’
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children every year is not born as a boy or a girl.
They belong among intersexual, a group diagnosed “ sex differentiation problems ” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or tesusers), or unusually developed genitals.
Valais ’ s Simpson was possibly intersexual.
Understanding gender identification is still not very developed, but most experts in the US advise to use the best available information on gender assignment if a provision is not possible and not wait for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding, if any, on an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “ soundde after a good thing. ”
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but that does not apply to most children, ” he said.
You can make a gender assignment without an operation and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity at all is not very accurate.
No one knows why.
It is like the secret why people are homosexual.
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender, because their status is not gender--based, but is due by their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically defines both at the same time, or not clearly, as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hairs, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice criticism.
Non-gender-identical boys now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to declare male, female, or “ third sex ” on official documents.
In June, Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ gender-” person after a court granted the lifelong retention of “ undefined ” gender status.
Besides M and W German cards will have a third allocation, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, including a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French deputies from the strictly Catholic country had signed a petition that the “ gender theory ” was to be removed from school books.
The US Catholic Online website has also spoken against German law on the grounds that “ if the world is dragged into new states, where gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twiort two other pillars of civilization. ”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she would be better to give babies a sex at birth.
“ Parental life is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your own child, ” she told the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female parts of the sexes have been called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Just ten years ago, medicine regarded gender as something to be eradicated and then rebuilt.
But the ethical foundations of an operation operation are now questioned after knowing how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex they assigned.
“ One, psychiatric emergency, was called in the middle of the 20th century, ” Drescher said.
When such a child was born you called not the psychirist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of treatment of children with unambiguous genitals is back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that the sex was formable.
He shaped the concept of “ gender identity ” and argued that social and environmental incentives – as parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones, shaping it whether a person sees himself as male or female.
But in a 1966 case called “ John / Joan, ” his theories became controversial.
He instructed the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off during a botched circumcision, to castrate the child and also to remove his trousers and then raise him as a girl.
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of transformation, but it was not, ” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
The age of 38, however,,, and in the case of the war,,, he was the victim of of the incident, in which he commit suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practise this model.
But, in the 1990 ’ s, with the Internet, survivors of these gender operations came public, who are “ not happy with the outcome. ”
Jim Bruce, Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear whether he had a big clitoris or small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man.
So his external organ and the testicle were surgically removed shortly after 1976 birth and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
“ I knew I was not a girl, ” he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
He should receive vaginal plastic at the age of 18.
But, being depressive and knowing that something was wrong, he demanded his medical files.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born – and none of them has ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to the male identity, received testosteron injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation has made it infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to make intersexual people perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, CEO of California ’ s Advocates for Informed Choice legal group, cares that German law can “ discourage stamping and stigmatization. ”
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and “ assign ” the child, not defined, ” she explained.
We fear that this favours intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we do not yet know what effect the law will have, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law, because “ it allows adults to be recognized as the third gender. ”
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender, ” she explained.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this time.
When they are adult, they can choose their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation problem and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law “ authoripowered ” ” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete android resistance.
Katie developed female characteristics because of the recipe defect of the target cells for testosterone.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in children's psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother mother.
“ The law gives room to parents, leaving them not hurry to make decisions, ” said Baratz.
It gives them time to make different tests and clarify things, thus giving them time before writing “ male ” or “ female. ”
In this way everything is fine – you pull the child big and you love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness.
And you do not have to rush an operation that cannot be undo.
“ This includes children in the decision and eliminated the fear that drives parents because they think they would not do the right thing, ” she explained.
In the end, the child decides on the sex that is better suited to him – and that is wonderful.
This will put children in a position to make the decision themselves.
Unknown people injure girls from Car
Unknown people have injured a twelve years old at Schüssen from Anhalt in Saxony-Anhalt.
On Thursday evening, the perpetrators had presumably fired with an air pressure weapon on a group of children.
That informed the police in Burg.
The girl had been slightly wounded on the left Wade.
Rescue workers brought the girl to hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators were also shocked at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
They then drove away from it.
The criminal police are investigating, as was said on Friday.
Until now the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were only called twice to be icy children who threw them against house facades.
Since homeowners recognized this in good time, and removed the remains of the egg straight away, no material damage should have been caused either.
The city is located by the west side of the river, on the west side of the river river.. It is located at the the end of the, at at the end of all the city, and is located at the end of the city centre.
A resident of the bishop of Friendor Way reported that his car was wrapped with cloppaper and his Radzier blinds were wasted.
But the man all found his Radzierblenden der once again in the immediate vicinity until the police arrived, so the police did not have to act further.
Living with the Future
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives in dreamy.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes by public transport.
" You are hopefully not afraid of spiders? " asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not a spspider phobia, but a concern that she cannot cope with the many stairs steps to the house and apartment in old age, she explains.
Moreover, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifties have experienced for herself what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap.
A book she has published recently on the subject of' Happily living in old age - Which form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what does not possible in old age' begins to tell her.
When she moved to the maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today at mid-fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks about it differently.
However, she knows that she is one of the few people to deal with the issue of living in old age.
Most people crowd it out as long as possible.
Only the others get old,' she says she smiles.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you give yourself some thought.
'But then it can also be too late', says Ries.
In her book the interior designer presents 17 housing models for a self-determined living in old age.
'Which form of residence you choose, however, is always an individual decision,' she explains.
D i e solution does not exist for the age.
Even those who can afford the retirement rect in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also become ill.
And:' Without good knowledge of the national language, you also unite in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist book author gives expulsion willing to consider.
Among their models you will find classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often-cited Rentner-WG.
In old age everyone has their ticks and masks.
'For me such a community of housing would be nothing,' she says with a eye wink.
Not at all like in a student WG with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
'In old age you will also need your retreat areas', according to Ries.
The book author does not want to rule out that a community of senior citizens can still work.
However, this would have to be different from what happened in the classic Studenten-WG.
And sometimes you just want your tranquility,' she believes.
It is not alone in this opinion, at least in the country's capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as it goes' is also the experience of Theresa esa huts, the head of the civil service life at the age of the state capital.
Your department advises people on the subject of becoming elders.
That is why older people in particular would often accept inconveniences and restrictions only in order to stay in their familiar environment, which is also the experience of Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many possibilities to design the house or the apartment without any barriers.
Ries recommends that everyone involved in the reconstruction of their house or apartment according to age age be thoroughly informed first and not to hire the first craftsmen.
Today there are also specialists for age-appropriate rebuilding.
Even in the rental apartment, one or two things can be realized, and if it is only the increase in toilet seats, the interior explains the interior designer.
But the existing apartment cannot always be redesigned according to the age and thus therefore free of barriers, even if it is still so beautiful.
Waltraud had to experience Waltraud Ries.
The apartment was able to install a stairlift, which would also paved with stairs all the way to the living door.
She will search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving move, she grays more than in front of the spider on her living door.
The US wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence worker Edward Snowden.
He is still accused of illegally transmitting secret information.
So he has had to face criminal proceedings in the US, in Washington said the US State Department spokesman, Jennifer Psaki.
Snowden ’ s recent statements would not change that either.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Green politician Hans-Christian, Ströbele appealed to the US not to threaten him with any further punishment.
Psaki emphasized that current statements were those of a parliamentarian and not a member of the German government.
The intelligence student Edward Snowden is generally prepared to contact the German authorities.
First, however, he wants to make his situation clear.
The former NSA employee wanted by the USA has made this clear in an unaddressed addressed letter that Green Minister Hans-Christian, Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwaron to the Federal Government, Bundestag and Federal Adsecutor.
According to a translation circulated by Ströbele, the letter reads as follows:
To the Permanents
I have been asked to write to you about your enquiry into mass monitoring.
I am Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contraccontracted or through direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
During my work in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government which prompted me of a moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent hunt that forced me to leave my family and my country.
I am currently in exile and enjoy the temporary asylum that the Russian Federation is granting to me in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, and also senior officials - including the United States - have regarded the revelations of a system of all-embracing surveillance that is accountable to anyone as a public service.
These spyon revelations inspired many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the once covert abuse of public confidence.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear and, at the same time, the acquired risks have been visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a trustword and seeks to criminalize and accuse political expression.
Yet speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will adopt this detrimental stance.
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and in accordance with the law in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to talking with you in your country, as soon as the situation has been clarified, and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects all of us.
Edward Snowden bears witness to Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a Private Purchaser
“ The building is in good hands, ” says Winterlingen ’ s mayor Michael Maier.
The commune sold the former kindergarten in the Gartenstraße to a private person.
The municipal council agreed to the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a " reasonable " price.
" The Municipality is atisfactory, " says Maier.
EUR 100 000 had been earmarked in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is quite right that Winterlingen handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and therefore no longer have to pay for the entertainment of the house how to heat, look at the garden and clear the sidewalk.
" This effort is now gone, " Maier ier is delighted.

Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 campaign, says the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign, “ Double Down: Game Change 2012. ”
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had carried out “ extensive group meetings and surveys in late 2011, to find out whether Obama ’ s waning hope of re-election looks better off to drop bees.
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times ’ national correspondent, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of senior officials in the campaign and the White House, notably the White White White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the polling values of replacing former Secretary of State Clinton with Vice-President.
The potential change was a tightly kept secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley, Obama ’ s former campaign leader, Jim Messina, and the senior White House adviser, David Axelrod, and David Plouffe – were aware of the envisaged change.
Double Down claims that Daley has at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite their “ close, personal relationship, ” before finally deciding against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not decisisignificantly improve Obama ’ s chances. ”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“ I said a whole range of things to be considered, and that was one of them, ” Daley told the magazine.
One must remember that the President had terrible survey values then, so we thought, “ For God's sake, what are we doing? ”
While Daley described the investigation as “ due diligence, ” Martin said to CNN's Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the re-election election campaign to determine whether such a train pays off in terms of the ballot box.
“ Camps do not spend so much money on surveys and focus groups if you do not think something about seriously, ” Martin explained on AC360.
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his former boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew known.
Martin added that “ double down ” provided no definitive answer to the question of whether the political explorations had reached Obama ’ s desk.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought that Obama did not know about the investigations into whether Biden should be dropped in the elections.
“ Possibly, ” Martin replied.
What is going on with my email on the way?
After all, e-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
In the design of the Internet service, was e-mail technically implemented letter secrecy, as with conventional mail?
The priority in designing early Internet services was to make communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not taken any care to create a stable basis for an audio-proof exchange of correspondence.
Therefore, a traditional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If the user " Anna " sends an email to " Benni ", are the computers of the two directly connected?
The e-mail program or browser of Anna will first send the mail to your service provider's mail server.
For example, if it has a Gmail account would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the route the mail can run via many other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to its provider.
Are traditional emails read on their way through the net?
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the way.
The sender ’ s provider usually checks whether the mail performrunning a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
The providers also check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail, which is immediately deleted or is at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems like GMail, the robot also detects the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display appropriate links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails with?
The likelihood of unauthorized people reading mail is very low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and the secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or read e-mails.
Then there are possible illegal spying operations.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from being read?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard an email can be effectively encrypted against co-reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of e-mail communication, so that it is not even easy to identify who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes, according to an investigation by the Convios Consulting of August 2013.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had recently decreased, Gmail from Google could increase significantly.
Mother Hidden in the Forest and Rent
When his prayed mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He committed the dead in a forest - and continued to receive their pension and nursing ance.
In order to be able to collect pension and foster allowfurther, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother after an investigation by the police in the forest.
First, he covered up the death of the 89-year-olds, then he took the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
As a result, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: at that time it was out that medicines were no longer needed for the mother in need of care.
The investigators told the pensioner that his mother had gone to Spain.
Because officials found this odd, they continued to find out.
It came out that the two had been living in a shared flat for more than 15 years, and that he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old had finally admitted the death of his mother.
An obsession, according to the police, showed no evidence of a capital crime.
Are you looking for ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice shining in the dark, using torments.
Charlie Francis exploited the fluorescent properties of the marine creatures and created a bright leak.
The idea came to him after reading a research paper on torture, and persuading Chinese scientists to artificially produce the shining protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when eating, thereby raising the pH value in the protein and triggering the luminination.
Chris explains that the ice reacts to the warmth in the mouth – so the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream Me I ’ DelDelicious company, says, “ The product is unbelievable but still at a very early production stage, so you get two grams of it for ££200. ”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value rises and the ice shines.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal for us to market it to Halloween, because it has this wonderful light effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made because the crystal luminaire is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes more delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, ‘ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream ’.
This is impossible in itself because of the breakruption of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I suspect we will find a way to achieve it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a torall artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
TSV Morsum, after six days of the match, is still without any point in the Handball League.
Right now, tomorrow, Ingo Ehlers' team will win the Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts for us.
" I hope that we will finally have our head free, " Ehler gives himself mildly optimistic.
He finally made his complete kader available, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme.
Daverden also, like us, uses tempo game.
We therefore need to keep our error rate low.
However, it is important to increase the cover, has recently left far from a safe impression.
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz presents itself in a much more relaxed atmosphere after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that ’ s why we are still far from being the favorite, because everything can always happen in the Derby.
However, Panitz now wants to follow up in Morsum to start a series.
Absent will be Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this purpose the A-youager Joost Windßuß, who is active with double playing rights at the A-youth federal league HC, Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Whoever is not hot in a game like this, should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Figures
When I was small, Halloween had a bit of magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today I became a Halloween Muffle.
In the last two years I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home, and I think I will not do so this year either.
But, according to the statistics, I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and decorations, according to the NRF.
One thing I am looking forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will amount to about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inirtivating inanimated objects are the last cry.
Women no longer need to dress themselves in sexy clothes; they can now also body seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As regards men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that the Daft-point space makers will make it into the instagrams this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect nothing is wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and, to my surprise, we were not alone.
Indeed, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
We are not impervious when it comes to candy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, slippers, candies and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Department of Commerce, who move through the quarters with the phrase of “ sweets or seeds. ”
In fact we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not deceive it.
The only thing we do not want to consume is sugarsweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweet Producers.
That is about nine billion corn grains.
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve.
Nothing is any more a part of Halloween than houses in which it is spuking.
They have great names such as ‘ Terror Behind the Walls ’ (which incidentally is in a real prison), ‘ Howl-O cream ’ and ‘ The House of Shock ’.
Indeed, America Haunts said that there are 1,200 officially recognized rush houses in the United States that generate $500 million proceeds, including some of the wonderful photos that you pink into your pants and then put your friends on Facebook, where you will not get rid of them and then leave one of the type you stand on a comment like “ a nice face expression. ”
But let us finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarius with the Great Pumpkin, when we were children, and the carving of a pumpkin blaf is like the decorating of the Christmas tree – something we have done from a small up.
Fortunately, the “ baby in pumpkin ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up with cutting the pumpkin kin, not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend $106 million on pumpkin, says the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin seeds, slowly rotpped in the front garden, probably come from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were this year.
If you want to score it right, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and pick something bad from their 921 kilogram pumpkin.
Helmbrake Housburn
The fire brigade had to step out on late Thursday evening in Helmbrecht.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches in the night to Friday fire.
The rescue forces hide a hidden corpse from the house.
Rescue workers found a chartered corpse in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrecht.
Whether it is an inhabitant is still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames already struck out of a window.
The staff went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burnt out completely.
The entire ground floor has been damaged.
All the other residents had not been at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
The building is no longer inhabitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has an open order to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible lack of pastors: the Evangelisch-Lutherische Landeskirche Hannover estimates that the number of its currently stands around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030.
For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily flow.
For the first time, the State Church commissioned a pastor on a full position to inspire young people for the theological study.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after abitation.
Bures go back to the process of secularfication: " God's voice is quiet, the world is loud ".
The profession should be characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my calendar and I can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors, as sailors, could be very close to the people.
They earned as much as teachers and could well live on it.
Of course, the free economy would pay more, but for that, theologians would have a secure employer.
This is true to today's young people, who are not just about career, but about inner work.
According to the State Church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, currently around 60 pastors retire each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a degree in theology are starting their viariat.
In sparsely populated outlying areas, such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to fill jobs in future.
Burographies want to organise study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
You can even become the President of Germany.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interiors include race seats and six-point belts as well as free intercom.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support for Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support up to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “ The Rally customers coming to Bowler have changed. ”
They are not all experienced racers, but people looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to open this way in partnership with Land Rover over and MSA and believe that the new format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the stress and the reality of Rally Raid.
We have really enjoyed to develop the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship.
There is also a training and test day at Defender Challenge in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called to rescue a bitch stranded 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky advance in a stone quarry.
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby ran away after a minor traffic accident.
Three days later a walker in the quarry discovered it in its miserable location.
Fire fighters dropped off on rock wall and saved the dog from safe death.
The fire brigade managed to bring a bitch into safety that was stranded on a 15 metre high advance in a rock wall.
The nine month old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived three days alone before she was saved from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 to whom dog belongs, came to Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately looked for their missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when she escaped the quarry after the small traffic accident.
At around 14: 15 on Wednesday, a walker who ran his dog watched the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter-high section in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station technical rescue team rushed up and sat down to rescue Rubys, then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, technical rescue team specialist, said, “ She was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff.
Now, however, it is doing well.
She then eaten a couple of dog cakes.
That was quite unusual.
The fact that the dog has been discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, the specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “ Ruby had a misfortune. ”
There was a possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to a veterinarian, who did not detect anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “ watching the rescue was frightening. ”
I couldn't believe that she was really at the top.
It was wonderful to keep them back in the arms.
The veterinarian said that if exhaustion had become too great and it collapsed, it would probably have collapsed.
The fire-fighters have done a great job.
What they have done has been really courageous.
We are just so thankful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “ We were afraid that it would fall down, but it stayed up. ”
The fire-fighters were great.
I can hardly believe where it was.
Mick Jagger says he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” from 2004.
Perry said that she had eaten the evening with the altrocker and that “ he begated me when I was 18 ”.
She added, ‘ That has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me ’.
In a statement, a representative Jaggers, 70, Thursday Thursday, said that he “ categorically denies that he had ever made any approaches with Katy Perry ”.
The representative added, “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the singers who performed this year ’ s Rolling Stony tour.
Their new album “ Prism ” immediately landed at number 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European Unbundling gives the Scots the Choice
A new day, a new terrible story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian wall.
Indeed, the Strathclye proposal highlighted the possible economic benefits that would bring greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this did not feature in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more favorable to them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continuing non-respect for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
So there is no story.
And one that has come in the years that it is already like a fossil: the first time I have heard the “ independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the continual repetition of this age-old history.
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance according to the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
That is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unify Europe has stalled.
The European project has officially died with the euro crisis.
Across the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw ard the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany – which was founded only this year – won nearly five million votes in the September ’ s federal election, thereby effectively expelling Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, together with the straitjacket into which the respective national economy is forced by adherence to the single currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro ’ s crisis has little to do with national governments creating excessive budget deficits – that was the case only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has padded its members on exchange rates, which are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to let that happen.
Without the possibility of a local currency depreciation, southern Europe finds itself at a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and monetary problems, there is a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the “ green ” energy policies imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice that for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage prescriations in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is rising, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to contain Germany and raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic economic policies on Europe the troubggling French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing, anti-EU, National Front has just won a crucial re-election, thereby putting the ruling socialists to third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division on the right would automatically bring benefits to the left.
What does Le Pen do with its renewed popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use next year's EU elections to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community monetary bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is very well possible – then for the first time, such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will come together to abolishing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something like the “ Europe of (sovereign) nations ” that General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may be stuck to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering with the United States.
But Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be in the Atlantic rain alone.
Where does Scotland stay with all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can get where.
I suspect that Scotland could do very well in a looser European union if we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing Norway the same and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, remarkably, the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe, and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due of the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Treasury Secretary, Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Demcoalition responsible.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now in order to have austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing Faster
Afro-american and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age peates, as studies show.
Physical Change Don ’ t Immedily Puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a catalyst of early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced among boys.
The former CNN correspondent, Pat Etheridge, is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grows breasts and shamhair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual paediatriatrics of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, paediatriatric endocologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and a new norm.
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – this is usually no sign that puberty is occurring fast, ” Kaplowitz explained.
Obviously development indicators, such as growing breasts, shame and axle hairs and body scent, are beginning to be seen among girls.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (occurrence of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“ When the development of breasts begins it takes at least two to three years for the Menarche, ” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “ Early Puberty ty in Girls: The essential advisor for dealing with this common problem ”.
Time is the most accurate test of puberty.
It is controversial about what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it must be “ premature ” if breast enlargement is accompanied by a surge in growth before eight years.
In most cases, the process slows or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor.
If things proceed more quickly, tests could be carried out by an endicronologist in order to eliminate serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and preventing any other consequence: premature aging of bones, which can lead to ultimate growth of growth and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reticent about drugs, but he admits: “ The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their being their age ents. ”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
“ They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side, ” Kaplowitz said.
“ It was a shock, ” a woman remembers whose daughter got her days with ten.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was emotionally unprepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones are the cause in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
Young people come to puberty in a similar way to girls earlier.
Kaplowitz believes that the most persuasive premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years of age, which establishes a correlation between body fat and the entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In that country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white-age colleagues.
There are different explanations for this.
Global early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: although boys have been growing facial of face and shame ever before, the trend towards a full-scale earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and shamhair is common even among babies and young children.
“ We need to be careful about how we identify the true beginning of puberty, " said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their paediatrician on how they should talk to their child.
“ This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected, ” said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who flourom early need the insurance, which the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than intended.
Jumo manufacturers are arguing over seating width in the face of large orders.
A dispute has emerged between leading aircraft manufacturers over the range of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the range of seats offered to passengers on long tourist class flights – not always those for which airlines are the most, but this designated space is the key to the claims of efficiency on the latest Airbus SAS Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus called for an industry standard this week requiring a tourist class seating width of at least 46 cm (18 inch), but the US arch-rival Boeing says that is what the airlines should decide.
The dispute is coming at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul pilers, and are expecting record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are nine or ten seat rows – is crucial to the stated economic outcomes that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design delivers.
Boeing claims its modernized “ 777X ” seats 406 people in tourist class seats, over 17 inch wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus says that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 passengers in 18 inch wide tourist class seats, with nine per series.
Aircraft giants often share goats about technical details through advertising in the trade press.
Airbus now calls to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to be in the race with more than 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new advertising war, with donors showing a picture in which three people squeezed in a restaurant, with the title: “ Would you accept that? ”
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats tighter than regional turbo props, ” says Airbus sales director John Leahy.
With a change in eating habits, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970 ’ s when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average male American increased between 40 and 49 years by 10%, according to US Health Department data.
According to the 21st century statistics, the average male American ’ s waist range is 100.8 cm, according to US health statistics.
Airbus says that its rival adhere to a 1950s seat concept, when the average body range of the freshly baped Jet Set ” was smaller.
Studies have been conducted, Airbus, showing that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53%.
Boeing denies Airbus figures on seat sizes and says it is not not the discretion of manufacturers to decide how the airlines strike the balance between flight tariffs and establishment.
The company also explains that according to studies, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of seats.
“ It really is about giving the airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe they need to be successful, ” explains Boeing ’ s cabin cabin expert Kent Craver.
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers it is about greater elelbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that can have an impact on sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least US $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20% more efficiency per seat efficiency in their latest two-engine long-range design than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing ’ s statements on the results are partly dependent on the 777X being compared to its ten per row compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than for machines with a series of ten seats currently used.
“ Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into its aircraft in order to make it more competitive to our products, ” says Kevin Keniston, leader of passenger comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full ten seats per row cabins in existing 777s indicated that many passengers chose to tighcloser arrangement, which could mean cheaper flight tariffs.
“ Eighteen inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777, ” says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin equipment, the founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers, from which the airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even contribute bandwidth to measure the equipment against the competition.
Even if they praise the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with highly condensed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a ten-seater A350 but, according to its own, it has not sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of increasing the adaptability of the cabins and offering wide seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that calls for a new industry standard may probably disappear but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotinine vaccine could eliminate the pleasure of smoking.
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from addiction for life.
Further tests will be needed prior to testing human humans, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good.
“ We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop by tried all the methods available on the market, but found that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches, ” said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to include genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain so a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained its normal level of activity.
But mice without vaccination would have taken “ time out, ” the researchers researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached her brain.
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower, because it transforms liver cells into anti-village factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if it is safe, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thereby preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“ They then know that when they start to smoke again, they no no longer enjoy pleasure because of the nicotine ine ine, and that helps them to abandon their habit, ” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but warned at the same time that further research was needed.
Tripodi denied being influenced by Obeid
An investigation is being launched by the state corruption supervision against former Laboratory Party Minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales.
The former NSW minister denies that he has amended the rules on maritime lease at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had covert holdings in three properties in a state-controlled country.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) broadextended on Friday its investigations into whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of ministers to extend rental contracts at the Circular Quay, where Obeids ran two restaurants and a café without a tender after they expired in August 2005.
Now it is being investigated for the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid ’ s hidden land interest in the wake of Tripodi ’ s former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole AshThursday.
In years of talks beginning in 2005, the government pushed for public tenders for rent contracts.
The guards were against it, and also wanted longer maturities.
In 2009, the lease contracts for companies at the Circular Quay, which donin $2.5 million a year to Obeids, were extended without public tender.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, originally called for public tenders.
But he refused to make the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pressed for a revision of the government ’ s lease arrangements.
A telephone note submitted to the ICAC showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi, and Steve Dunn, a senior civil official who had changed to the Port of Port after working in the Fisheries Authority under Obeid.
‘ Was the issue raised in these telephone talks the elaboration of the commercial lease arrangements?? ’, the Deputy Commissioner Anthony healy Tripodi asked.
“ No, ” Tripodi replied.
I do not remember what has been discussed, but that was definitely not the case.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes are attacking targets in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighters planes attacked a target on Thursday night in Syrian port of Latakia, confirmed a senior government official against Fox News.
The official did not explain what the objective was, but said that it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ Echtheitstest, ”
The government is considering an “ Echtheiness test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas through extended measures.
If the test were introduced, it would be used through a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for the migration of family and friends to Australia.
A proposal by the government has been published today after the former Laboratory Party MPs, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers, because they could be regarded as an insult by Australia's neighbors.
“ Loud statements like that foreigners should stand at the back ” and “ Australian first ” are a very unpleasant setback in times when trade unions demanded a protected labor market, ” she told the Australia India India Institute.
Historically, this meant that the white workforce should be protected – and if some in the region resrevile an echo of this historic artifact, that would not surprise me.
The proposal for discussion outlines 12 measures once envisaged by the former immigration minister, Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to discuss human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended amendments, and others are being considered.
If the ‘ authenticity criterion criterion ’ is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked to ascertain whether ‘ the application is genuine in those cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company ’.
Firms could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after, in the past, companies that wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after he arrived on the Christmas Island by carrying a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come to him with Australia has been taken after since his father ’ s father on Wednesday by an adult cousin, who was also on board.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to establish high-speed rail links between Scotland and the North of England as early as phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project' will bring Britain closer together'.
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After Phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and the North of England from £32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The UK Government in talks with Transport Scotland has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: ‘ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings the UK and its cities closer together ’.
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved by HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland. ”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown urged Carmichael to “ unequivocal ” promote Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said, “ The high-speed rail link has the potential of huge economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic strength also provides an argument for fast rail links across the UK. ”
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to deciding together on the next steps.
Electronic equipment regulations on aircraft remain provisionally in force in Australia
Australian passengers must continue to switch off off tablets and smartphones on starting and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read e-books, see, or play videos on their equipment when they are in “ flight mode ” during critical flight phases.
Passengers are already allowed during most of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they may not read their e-books when starting and landing.
Australian companies are monitoring the decision to which US airlines must do huge amounts of work, but have no immediate plans to change their rules.
The air traffic control authority CASA also stated that the announcement would be looked at, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment still apply at critical flight periods in Australia.
“ CASA does not currently have any specific regulations relating to the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft ”, has been announced.
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already had discussions with CASA about extending the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and declared that it is open to changes, but they need to be initiated by the legislator.
“ We would welcome a review of CASA ’ s approval of electronic equipment, because we believe that this would improve the customer experience experience after we offer (wireless entertainment) during flight, ” said a speaker.
Qantas said that they would stick with the current rules until further notice.
“ Our current guidelines state that electronic equipment may not be used at take-off and landing, and we do currently have no plans to change that, ” the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that are going to benefit passengers, and we will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
The decision has a different impact on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate the radio disruption caused by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programmes and customer training.
“ After an airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height, ” the FAA announced.
In rare cases, with poor visibility, the crew instructs passengers to switch off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be securely stored under the seat or in the subjects above the seats at take-off and landing.
In front of the Rederby against Schalke, BVB B trailers with light missiles had for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Prior to the Friday match of the Fußball-Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unfamiliar, almost penzy acoustic acoustic offering itself to the viewer just before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German Vice-Vice ster Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were the guests with their songs.
On the contrary, the southern gallery, where the most loyal faithful - and loudest - BVBB fans stand, presented itself first exceptionally arily quiet: no chants, no slaughter calls.
The pedestal of Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common control of beginner, remained unoccupied.
At the very front of the grandstand a big flag stood lonely, bearing the " section of stadium ban ".
Only as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player to enter the place, did short-short-term excitement.
When his team colleagues followed, there were loud vocals and wavering scarals - but far from being everywhere.
Nothing was raining in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern gallery.
Neither was no not mood by Norbert Dickel el listed the positive experiences of the last few days – Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, contract extension by Jürgen Klopp ’ s coach Jürgen Klopp.
Only five minutes before the start, the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension almost reached with hands came off in a very loud scream as usual retrieved the mood on the slopes of the stadium.
Finally, as always, the southern gallery was in turn - and finally as usual here was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call " Derbysiysieger is standing up " came with a fiff from the Southern stand, everything was again as usual.
The silence before was probably a response to what has happened over the last few days.
Directly to Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters who elled had fired light lights into the audience and and onto the square - hit almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzatzke subsequently received the heads of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and they believe Watzke ’ s words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement, " the BVB-Boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras a choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.
" I banned that, " he explained.
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnology.
Moreover, the Ultras have been presented with various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday, they now have time to opt for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will lay down a sanction by the end of next week.
" This will be drastic, " insured treasure.
We should be interested to see what the reactions will then be in the southern gallery.
Paving houses are booming in Singapore as the crisis has hit middle-class
In a deposit house in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga swaps a golden ripe, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay her daughters school fees.
“ My husband and I have just bought a house that put all my money in it, ” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earned $3,000 from Singapore (about €1,7730) as an administrative collaborant, and her husband worked every month, monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
Indeed, demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is growing – is so high that ValueMax, where it changed, this week became the third deposit house listed on the Sur ur stock exchange.
Puring jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhouses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just just above the 15.4% required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender, with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, deposit houses offer the advantage that there is no need to check creditworthiness or income records, which is why loans can be made more quickly than with banks.
That is why millions of people in the region are turning to pan homes after families feel the pressure from rising cost of living, and rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit, owing a loose fiscal policy in the developed economies, families with lower and middle-income are looking for pandhouses, order to for the difference in a faltering economy.
This week described the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly through rising mortgages, as a risk factor in the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the agency, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore have Asia ’ s highest budget debt relative to GDP.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, with an increase of 60% in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which came narrowly out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a fall in consumer demand.
“ In effect, this means that, with the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) are going to try to supplement their income wherever possible, ” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend to pledge personal items, as people take the opportunity to transform the family jewellery into cash.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items being treasured in the 200 complexes of the township are gold.
People say, “ The gold price looks good, let us pill grandmother ’ s gold chain and bring it back next month. ”
The largest Thai Pfandhouse operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% customer increase in its branches in recent months.
Pfandgrowth is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says YYeah Lee Ching, eeMax Managing CEO.
The company finances this with 60% of Singapore ’ s 66 million dollars it took on the Singapore stock exchange this week.
While some lenders were entered a crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that morthouses would not only provide lower interest rates than other lenders, but would not directly increase the debt.
“ Customers insult objects that they already possess, and the volatility of personal objects of personal value does not increase household debt, ” she explains.
The deposit bond business is increasingly socially accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Nor are not all people who use deposit loans in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax's stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they get up to 60% of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come from every social class.
“ These include wealthy people who lend something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses that must bridge bottlenecks in cash flow, ” says Yeah.
Sometimes they need money very quickly.
NSA sucks Google and Yahoo data - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence revelEdward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to ate the increasingly exploitating NSA spheres.
After presenting the Green Day member Hans-Christian Ströbele, at his surprising meeting meeting with Snowden, in Russia, he discussed the conditions under which ex-staff would report with a German public prosecutor or before an investigation committee.
Snowden pointed to his complicated legal situation, as Ströbele told the ARD magazine " Panorama ".
$325 million Australia ’ s Tasmanan Health Bailout
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the bailout of more than $325 million for Australia s Tasmanic health package in order to ensure that the state government cannot squander the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases, and system restrictions.
The cing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanan depMember Andrew Wilkie.
“ The government has created an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state, ” Plibersek said.
The US $335 million package consists of $31 million in emergency aid for electoral services.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and grey arstar treatments, aim to eliminate residues.
There is also money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care for stationary stays, specialist medical training, mental health services, and the introduction of an electronic health data recording system in local hospitals.
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that hospital staff have told me that they were the best way to improve the Tasmanic health system, ” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on the strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanan Government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report every on where the additional money has been spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie has out today, the $325 million would do little if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmanic health system on a more sustainable course. ”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state public health system off the care list, ” said Wilkie.
According to the federal government, these benefits will largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But the opposition ’ s federal health spokeskesman Peter Dutton, believes that today ’ s announcement is only a pavement. ”
“ We are able today because the laboratory government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system, ” he said to ABC TV.
It is unacceptable for a state government to pull almost almost half a billion out of the system and the Commonwealth to put 300 million in it and pretend that were good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaption of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but it is also a heavier food than necessary.
The plot, played in France in the 1760s, tells the griling story of Suzanne, a young noblemen sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic Colonel and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slides into gloomy or sensational lust – and that is where its problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a cruelous b-shirt for the public.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, including a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for producing chemical weapons and gft gas munitions, declared the Global Chemical Weapons Group on Thursday Thursday, while serious clashes in the north of the country near one of the sites where supposedly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activists group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed almost three years ago since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement by the Chemical Weapons Organization (OPCW) was made one day before the deadline.
1 November, which the Hague Haag based organisation Damascus had set up to destroy or ‘ inoperable ’ facilities for producing chemical weapons, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, must still begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and Sarin's nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday when experts say that there is a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities, as the UK-based Syrian Human Rights Monitoring atory said.
The activists group, which follows the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, declared on Thursday that 120,296 people died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad's army that 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead, 2,202 were deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict at 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated to date.
The conflict has forced around two million people to flee the country.
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against rebels, many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fighting underscores the danger posed by the chemistry weapons inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a time race in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team “ now convinced that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of the major production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria. ”
That is why ‘ no further inspection activities are currently being planned ’.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
Because of safety concerns, it had not been possible to visit two facilities said the inspectors.
On Thursday, OPWC declared that the two sites, according to Syrian statements, had been abandoned … and the objects in the chemistry weapons programme had been relocated to other named facilities that had been inspected. ”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC executive committee next month.
“ I take aluto the bravery and courage you have all shown in carrying out the most formidable mission ever undertaken by this organization, ” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Supervision Organization, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting for a secession of Shia Islam in this civil war against Assad ’ s government and against its security forces, which includes many members of the Alawites.
As regards further developments, the head of the monitoring group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion unknown, he explained.
Fury at the verdict of Bali ’ s Bombing
Survivors and relatives of 202 people who died in the bombing in Bali in 2002 were angry about the verdict of the last of the instigators brought to justice, because they believed that Umar Patek should be shot by law.
Patek, who had fleed one of the most wanted people of southeast Asia for almost ten years, was yesterday sentenced to a 20 year prison sentence for his role in building explosive devices for the bombing.
If he had been suspended, he could be dismissed after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others.
A charge has also been made in a series of terrorist-related charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The public prosecution office had demanded a life sentence, even though it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, for of his or his reputation, is also called a ‘ demoolition man ’.
The decision awraised painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39 year old twin brothers Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his conspirgers almost ten years ago.
Tears fighting she said that Patek should have been condemned to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“ You should be him in front of a shooting commando, ” said Corteen teen to AAP.
I have to live every day with not having any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughghters.
The Sari Club was razed to ground when on 12 October 2002 just after 23 p.m. a massive bomb bomb exploded in a small let parked outside the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where a suicide bomber exploded an explosive rucksack just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into the coma for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times while he hung ended on a life preservation system.
Hughes said that Patek deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas, and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodage and executed four years ago.
In fact, this type should receive the death penalty before everyone else.
To keep him alive – no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers in court.
He escaped nearly a decade of arrest, but was eventually picked up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where US forces killed the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, than four months later.
During the negotiations, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden to rebuild the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“ He did not stand up, ” said Corteen.
Until recently, he showed no repentance for how much suffering he inflicted on other people.
The verdict came before the ten-year anniversary of this year ’ s attack, with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
“ There will be many tears this year, ” said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic equipment on aircraft (but not make mobile phone calls)
Air passengers can now listen to electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and viewing films, from departure to landing, but do not telephone on mobile phones, according to the new guidelines issued by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the respective airline, explained FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft compcomply with the new directives and that they have updated the staff's training manuals and the rules for stoning the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
These airlines also included Delta and JetBlue.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon, ” the FAA announced in an announcement.
Currently, passengers must switch off smart phones, tablets and other devices when aircraft doors are closed.
You will not be allowed to resume again until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When they enter the landing flight, passengers have to switch them off again and not take them off again before the aircraft has landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the equipment even the take-off, landing and the wheelfield, the FAA explained.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted to higher heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Aviation Support Association, welcomed the changes.
“ If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – then both sides will benefit from it, ” said Glading.
To be honest, we are tired of feeling like watchdogs on this issue.
However, Internet connections for surfing, sharing emails, text messages or downloading data less than three kilometres remained prohibited, explained the authority.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, tablets, and other devices into flight mode.
So no “ Words With Friends ” resembles Scrabble online game that actor Alec played Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to shut it off while the aircraft was parked on the platform.
And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be stowed, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight also continue to be prohibited.
Regulatory for telephone calls rests with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic equipment when taking off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board said that national transport safety experts on CBS News said that mobile phones were still regarded as a risk.
“ Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the air transmission can also disrupt transmission masts, ” RosenRosenker.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine this issue recommended last month that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic equipment.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, from Missouri, that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of equipment has become ubiquitous.
Some studies say that, up to a third of passengers forgets or ignores shutting off the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers in 1966, after reports of disturbances in navigation and communications equipment had become known by passenger co-operated radios, which represented the latest trend in technology at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and so approved by the FAA that they do not like electronic interferences.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers for a number of years when the flight altitude is reached.
The planes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new directives, Huerta said.
Today ’ s electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only give minimal radiation when smoother.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are higher.
proponents of the relaxation of restrictions on passenger use of equipment include Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of a Kindle e-reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believes that the disruption by the equipment is genuine, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only isolated reports from pilots who would argue for the disruption of aircraft systems by the equipment, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA should allow pilots to order the equipment to be turned off when the instrument being landed under poor visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would now be fully equipped with technology.
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with security, ” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Vogel rescued by air rescue service from North Sea drilling island.
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released released into nature.
The water trap was flown to Aberdeen last month with a helicopter where it was ped by the Scottish animal-welfare organisation SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said, “ This water trap was probably a wintry train bird from northern Europe, held ted by the strong winds over the North Sea. ”
Apparently, the exhausted bird was looking for sanctuary on the drilling island.
He added: “ He could not fly further so we were contacted with the request for help. ”
With her release, the water trap was again fit and healthy.
Is Europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with the United Kingdom?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who provide wealth and work in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British leaders, asking them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives, roughly representing British business sizes, sectors, and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states are stagnating.
They want to see government favoring new trade links with countries such as China, India, and Brazil, rather than resaging with the long and demanding process of reforming obscure EU institutions.
Need, in their view on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, because according to companies, the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40% of large companies agreed to what is traditionally the most pro-European one.
Finally, and this probably says the most, our consultation with economic leaders showed that a clear majority wanted the Britain to take a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This realization, shared by companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for “ meaningful change ” that brings the course of action back to Britain.
Much is at stake – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16% shift in favor of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate Britain's terms for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect renegotiation as a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone now moves toward closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, what business means increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller describes the pipeline in Bulgaria as the start of a new gas era
The construction start of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects, declared the Board of Gazprom Gazprom.
“ Today's event is a milestone: construction has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, " said Gazprom's CEO AlexAlexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the whole of the European continent.
South Stream should ensure greater diversity in Russia ’ s export routes through Europe.
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensures, as official say, increased risk on conventional routes.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated to transit countries are ‘ forever forever ’.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at favourable rates when the entire project becomes operational in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other neighbouring countries is to begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline has an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff accused before charges charges of sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexoffences related children before charges were brought against child carer Jonathan Lord, from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse has learned.
However, in the opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that ‘ it had never had to do with an incident of sexual abuse in the organisation ’.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case where one YMCA employee was charged of offences with child pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted for abusing entrusted children in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the European Commission, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s opening declaration to the Commission was also imprecise in claiming that there were external reviews of the YMCA that recognised the YMCA as at the forefront of child safety ’.
Evidence before the Commission rather shows that the YMCA has been informed of receiving the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities (the Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management failed “ downwards ” from me to hire Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report breaches of the child safety policy.
Lord had been sentenced at the beginning of the year for sexual offences against twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
But Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Lords ’ s child safety violations.
The staff said that they had observed infringements, including that Lord was alone with children, looked after them privately as babysitter, let them sit on his own lap, one said that he liked, and let children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose leader was Lord, who asked for training on child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child's service director Jacqui Barnnat, who was the Lords in the YMCA Caringbah, was “ very intimidating and very inaccessible for most of the time. ”
The managing director said that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord has affected their judgment, which is why they had not notified him.
Hare explained that he informed the YMCA NSW Executive Board of his view that the lesson that the organization has to draw from the “ Jonathan Lord ” ” does not affect “ the stering ” by employees, and the Executive Board agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the accusations were made was taken by the managing director of the child services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this would prevent contamination of the evidence, which had been ‘ over-zealous ’ and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW had not been a child-safe organization at the time when Jonathan Lord was working there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, sexual abuse expert, declared the Commission.
He explained that there had been “ serious problems ” with staff recruitment, review, training, training, and supervision.
The hearing was deferred until 20 December.
Tony Blair said that he would take the opportunity to return as a British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair largely avoided his enting on British policy, and his comments have been confined to both foreign policy and his role as the Quartet's envoy peace in the Middle East.
When asked whether he would like to return to Prime Minister, Blair was quoted in the words of the Evening Standard of London: “ Yes, safe, but that is unlikely to happen, so …... ”

He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he care about.
As he started, it will not be long before he is on the “ horse of the year ” show – and I am sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse brew said, “ Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony. ”
Together, they are a great team.
The jurors judged Fenton and Toffee how well they would have beaten and presented themselves in the show ring.
They care for good cooperation between Pony and leader – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am sure Fenton's sweet clothes have played their part in making that really fit perfectly for the occasion.
The Chinese newspaper is called to be “ reformed, ”
A Chinese newspaper, which on the front page had called for the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation, should be reformed, declared a press regulator.
The Guangzhou based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a state-owned company.
Now the New Express is being subjected to “ comprehensive recovery, ” the regulator declared.
The “ Rectification Order ” was issued by the Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“ The New Express ’ s editorial management was disorderly, ” the regulator announced in a statement.
She said that she had decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and deprive him of his reporting license. ”
It also instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a full review of the New Express and has recommended that it identify the the persons responsible for the New Express and immediately review the New Express ’ s management team. ”
Chen wrote several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment.
“ In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence, ” he explained to the state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out of money and glory.
I have realised that I have acted incorrectly.
Following Chen ’ s apology, the New Express issued an apology on the front page and explained that it failed to review the reports correctly.
Various well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a legislative change at the beginning of the year bannprohibited the authorities from compelling someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel with its own railway between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical railways, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the tunnel, measuring 120 times 90 centimetres as one of the most sophisticated passages they have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs over a length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless unvisible warehouses in the area, which makes it easier to conceal drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognisably, the authorities declared.
According to the Court ’ s of the opinion, the subsequent discovery of the tunnel included eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms cocaine.
Three men who, according to the authorities, were working as drivers, were accused of the possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened with imprisonment for a sentence of between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of treatment channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexiko in October, which challenges the drug cartels with how to quickly bring their product to the consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of 640 meters with rails running from a kitchen in a home in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr Still

Kerr and he still loved himself, emphasized the 36-year old.
" We will support each other and love each other as Flynn parents ".
Kerr and Bloom are married since 2010, and Flynn was born in 2011.
According to Lexika veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but is very different from it.
For while vegetarians allow to eat cream cream, ice cream or a strong Edam, these meals are not on the menu of a vegegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the abandonment of meat and fish, the vegan dislikes all consumption of animal products - also denies honey.
What remains one might wonder, but on closer examination, the veganan food world is characterised by considerable ingenuity.
" Broad spreads are very popular, " explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store at Domgasse.
He was born New Zealand and lived vegan for 13 years, and he find (almost) everything that he needs to live in Lampertheim.
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
" The conviction came not only because of the diet, however, also because of the choice of shoes, " says Proctor, who preferred artificial leather over normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, vegan is an ethics.
" I do not want animals to die for me, " Proctor states the maxim of vegans, which covers all consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, stirrled eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered a whole new products, and enthusiasm enthusiasm has increased.
" It is a double bonus, " says Proctor today, " in fact, vegan is not a waiver, not asesis, but an enrichment. " On the assumption that you can reduce the choice of food options options, Proctor reverback to the power of habit.
And it was these conditions that failed some, even so well-intentioned attempts.
" The addictive factor is a very decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking, " Proctor makes a comparison.
And says: " certain tastes cannot be attached to the animal ".
Often it is the spices or type of preparation that make the taste.
" You can also create the same effect in a other way, " the vegan explains.
Proctor will bring egggines, mushrooms and some vegan sausages to a grill party.
He pays attention for a balanced and varied diet, in which he should also have a good taste.
Of course you want something between the teeth, that is legitimate.
" It should taste, but this is not only reduced to animal food, " says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption that he has not suffered.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I do not take foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan.
" My blood values are excellent, I let myself check very often ", " explains Proctor.
Many veganism critics, in particular, warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
" As animals are fed with feed, instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the refrigerator, the vitamin-B12 portion is high, " Proctor finds.
For vegans you can also take the coenzym in the form of tablets.
" My B12 values are fine, " he explains.
Proctor does not need to go a long way to produce food.
After all, basic and basic foods are available everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
I find everything I need on the spot.
I only buy something special from time to time.
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is what it happens with " ordinary " finished products ".
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly thought.
" There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small knees you can achieve good, if not partially better results, " says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, slightly more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with his vegan cheese cakes, Proctor also also amazished his father-in-law.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
If you cook with dynamism, it has a new value.
" The situations that arise are as different as people themselves, " says Proctor.
Of course, he has already been met with scepticism.
Do you no longer like my food?
" Am I supposed to feel bad now because I drink milk? " - you have to be sensitive as a vegan.
" I do not reject people, I am part of this society, " Proctor does not want to delay an enlavendasein.
And, more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegane as suspected - and not vegegegans as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also permitted.
Pommes can be found everywhere!
" Many Don shops offer Falafel, or a vegetarian Yufka, " says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he deviates to pasta, or order a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow to face up to it.
" When I started feeding myself vegan 13 years ago, it was all much more difficult, " the New Zealand country can find a development: " You have to talk to people, make them aware of it ".
" If enough requests come, they may be inclined to complement the menu, " he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the bushes in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Essentially, vegane dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
" On the contrary, meat dishes are exclusive in the true sense of the word because they exclude others, " Proctor notes.
" In order to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible, " says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be somewhat difficult at the beginning.
Especially when you learn to understand that animal additives can also be included as coldder in penuts, you seem to leave quickly the courage, by following the ethics of so many hurdles and traps.
This is not only why Reuben, Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book " Veganissimo - animal nutrients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that nutrifood and detergents.
" You gradually develop a scanner view and know what signs and the logos to look at, " It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble, " Proctor knows.
Vegeganism, it is an important moral fingerprint that raises awareness.
He may not entirely manage to abandon his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question their habits.
The exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers in breath.
Trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended in Germany on Friday afternoon.
In a communication, the operator caused technical problems.
The other 11 US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues with a whole series of smaller and larger panes at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq's indexes had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August this year, there had been two panas in one week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs sent a mass of flawed purchase orders to the option markets because of technical problems.
As a result, exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and cancel the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trade in the US stalled for several hours because of a computer breakdown at the Nasdaq exchange.
Facebook ’ s stock exchange also caused a stir last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not met the flood of purchase and sales orders, later identified the SEC Exchange Authority and condemned the company to a record fine of $10 million.

British police are providing Assange with an extradition notice
The British police have today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and sought asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said that a 40-year-old Australian was “ asked to stand, ” asking him to appear in a local police station and added, if he did not, he was arrested.
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden for the charge of a sexual off, after its capabilities have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court has rejected its appeal to extradition earlier this month.
Having feared that Stockholm would to extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has “ issued an invitation to a 40-year-old man to stand at a police police station at a time we have chosen, ” a spokesman.
He continues to violate his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears that he is extradited by Sweden to the United States and charged for possible charges of espionage after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Drivers who had ked between their legs with 210 km / h and hot drink will receive a £1,000 fine.
A driver has been fined for £1,000 because he had travelled with up to 210 km / h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police had stopped him, they discovered the beverage between his legs.
At the District Court of Colchester, Howie was guilty without having travelled the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie has also been sentenced to pay £90 costs and a £100 victim surcharge.
Tax on foreign property owners against London ’ s speculative bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of the Chancellor of the Exchequer George George Osborne, who imposed a 7% stamp tax in 2012 2012 budget on homes over £2 million, and annual fees for buyers who hold homes as a firm and not as individuals.
Already, stamp tax income in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts totaled £708 million in 2012 / 13 tax year, exceedaggregproceedrevenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, North West, Yorkshire, and the Humber region.
Cook said, “ After raising stamp tax on a high-priced housing and the associated legislation against dealing, it is difficult to argue that high-quality real estate is taxed too low, regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system. ”
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more restrained in buying real property in London or prevent owners from selling it, ” he added.
First class real estate – the top five to 10% of the housing market by price – in London ’ s wealthy South-West belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimblebledon, became more expensive at a record value of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London grew at 5.6% per year, but were overovershadowed by an emerging “ domestic market, ” in which the south-western part of London, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to Saville's study.
Scientists could shed more light on the connection between a dog ’ s swwing and its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs sww the tail more to the right (from the dog point of view), while it was the left side of the nervous side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurost of Trento University, said: “ It is well known in humans that the the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions. ”
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that dogs like humans, the brain right right was responsible for movement on the left, and vice versa, and that the two hemisphes played different roles in feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to their fellow ’ s lateral tail edards, the researchers monitored the animals while watching the watch the films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “ We have shown films with dogs to the dogs – either a faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, enabling us to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right. ”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the moving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was mainly left (again from the perspective of the dog that was wedging), their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
Professor Vallortigara takes the view that the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
He is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience which movements they should worry and when they should not.
He said, “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wedding with the tail is more linked to friendly behaviour, and the right side tends to produce a less friendly behavior, you will react on the basis of these experiences. ”
Researchers say that the findings help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their animal ’ s emotions.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behaviour and guest scholship at the Faculty of Animal Medicine of the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right was important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads left when they see an aggressive dog and to the right when it is a satisfied dog.
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada it said: “ The dogs go more to a robot dog dog if his tail tail is wedwing left and not right rather than becoming unrestless – exactly the other way than in the Italian study. ”
According to his statement, the differences could stem from the fact that the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or in the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two half of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception, ” said Bradshaw.
As their behavior is easy to record, it will probably not take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.

Pope Francappoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will call on 22 February, new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the top clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also who choose a Pope so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in choosing his successor.
There are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal aged 80 can no longer participate in the Pope election – that belongs to a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals. ”
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that there would be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony on the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the consistency orium.
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the consistency in February in advance to plan other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world, ” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would probably have fallen by February.
He said that a Pope normally takes as many cardinals as necessary to return the number of eligible cardinals to 120, and as many cardinals above 80 as he likes.
Next year ’ s consistency is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero ero.
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance, ” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the creation of the Cardinal Council, established by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are charged with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
“ Now Francis chose these eight cardinals to help him, ” said Valero.
He said that it is “ well possible ” for Francis to ask the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – that is all very new.
Valero said that the bishops from large places would typically be called to cardinals, but Francis is s “ full of surprises – so we do not know who he calls. ”
GM is calling for new pickups in the US to repair the seat backrest.
General Motors recall nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silver and GMC from Sierra-Pickup shocks in 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat rest, a announcement by the U.S. Car Safety regulator on Friday.
For some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for resting the front seat rest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines on vehicle safety in head restraints.
“ When driving back onto the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraint does not protect passengers properly so there is an increased risk of causing injury ”, the news appeared on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTHTSA).
The retrieved models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
Delivery of the GM pressure began in June and will be the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of the SilverFast and Sierra rucks, newly developed for the 2014 model, had increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, declared GM on Friday.
GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pick-up prints in October.
GM shares increased on the New York Stock Exchange by 1.4% to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Obama ’ s Cry of Despair
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts, frustrated by Republican blockade tactics.
Blockade politics do not apologize Obamacare ’ s website problems, the drone attacks
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a horrendously sad book.
It is a book that I believed would stoke me up during the decepous second year of my medical studies and give me renewed hope.
It says “ The Audacity acity to Win, ” describes Barack Obama ’ s memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patients' papers and go to bed at night the book takes me back to a time when politics could take millions of inspiration and stop a speeches.
The election became a landslide victory and news spokesman held in order to highlight the historic significance of this hour.
My classmates wept for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on its way to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
Then, when Obama took office in 2008, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching over again to the present is a bad awakening, as if you were pulled out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Indeed, something has changed in the years since I voted for the first time.
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act on health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the army enforced ial of homosexuality, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I agree that the partisan blockblockade tactics have turned too many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay Bay, to name a few.
But, having defended the Obama administration against colleagues and acquaintances on countless occasions, I have come to the end of my attempts to explain.
I have come to a point of political despair.
Republican policy of blockade cannot explain why they allow foreign leaders to interintercept or allow the killing of innocent children by overseas drones.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans ’ private lives and why Whistlebblowers are punished that reveal state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the limits on public funding and spending are being circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the efforts of the White House to restore the rest of the media are ‘ the most aggressive... since the Nixon government ’.
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know whether that is what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at 18 that government work could contradict the political campaigns preceding it.
Obviously, the Office of the ties is not a predictable course, given that an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre characterise public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
That bothers me most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney, a confusing and ill-thouout alternative, seemed to be unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope of which we had been hearing for so long.
But, with Obama ’ s approval ratings falling to below 45% this week, this book has made a tougher return to 2008.
It arouses me yearning for the many promises that have vanished in the air.
This week, I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to make a heavy loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primelection.
In a meeting with election workers following the decision, he told his staff that they had to come back on course and follow the purpose of their cause.
“ I would like us to find our magic again, ” he said.
We must remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr President, and I could not agree with more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflicts of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave, because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, in a judicial dispute about paying $6 million in carbon tax, argued when it wanted to brush aside questions about whether it was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, important for deciding whether carbon and mining taxes will be cut or cut.
But Palmer argued that only ministers could have conflicts of interest, and Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the law.
“ He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she receives a holiday, ” said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially Palmer by 53 votes after the recount as the winner of the Sunshine cost seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a review of the vote counting process to make it faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“ We need a better system, ” he said.
Why should we not have a system for invading, entering data into a computer, selecting immediately and then having the result at 6: 30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of penins when marking the ballot papers.
Do you use them because you can wipe the results if you do not like them?
Coordining them with pencils today is incredible.
The Electoral Commission examined the electronic election options and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, declared that his policy includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and that he would take his new office “ very seriously. ”
A public office is about public service.
“ We do not strive for any reward other than history, namely that we can serve this community at a critical time, ” he said.
RBS Suspensions Two Forex Dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global official investigation is piceding up with speed with the alleged manipulation of the currency market.
Some of the world ’ s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market, in which 5.3 trillidollars will change owners every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the expanding investigation followed by the Libor interbank scandal.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspension, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from the authorities.
“ Our investigation into this issue continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA CA and other regulatory ators ” said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation stated that the RBS forwarded records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a former trader to the UK regulatory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and is said to have been judged by his current position as European Head of Forex pot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was suspended this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders has been accused of misconduct.
The Usher instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator told Finma that it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently allegations that bankers have agreed in currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations quiries or received requests for information from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks triam through instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
News about these investigations has brought traders into moil in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment banks ’ trading units in recent years, but was under pressure this year because low currency volatility constrathe opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that, despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms means that “ one can influence the market at very low ticket prices. ”
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it terminated a trader of its London Exchange Traded Funds offices this week after causing a loss of close to $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly has informed and cooperates with the relevant authorities.
“ We are sure that the trader has acted alone, and that the matter has been contained, ” said Credit Suisse.
Building fence painted on Bechtle plot
A group of the citizens' initiative " Swiss meadow " has enhanced the tree fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
Moreover, it puransed and broadened the footpath, as stated in a press release.
The planned covering of the decintegrating house in the rear part of the plot had not been allowed for security reasons, because the site is in danger of slipping.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the site, had agreed the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke Reinhard Domke.
Before the BI's action, a banner was placed with the message' We are for favour'.
However, this did not affect the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Her motto on the big poster was' We are against building ruins'.
In doing so, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - if the gigantic project would one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of " construction site " it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will be better, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But the BI says that they are starting resigning because the city is further delaying these answers.
As we have heard, the mayor's public statements also impact.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he was afraid of the breakdown of the thermal bath if the public took a decision for the public to vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some therefore seem almost frightened; others see it as a " crude attempt at blackmail " the population, as stated in the press release of the press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnik Scent for Shielis: Mane ’ s No Swallow King
Ralf Rangnick is so satisfied with the current high form of the Bundesliga leagtable leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the " Bullen " of the referees was so disappointed.
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category Schwalbenkönige, " he defended the two offensive wiokers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest reason for Rangck ck ’ s criticism was yellow for Mane at 3: 0 against Grödig last Sunday, where the Senegalese made an alleged actor a failure – but which was not, as the TV pictures showed.
" A flagrant misdecision, " Rangnick said, who described referee Harkam as " completely overstretched ".
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the match.
He firmly defended his German compatriot: " I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in each and every situation ".
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the Scharmüirel.
I do not know why.
" Because I am the one who was insulted, " the 46-year-old stressed.
Given its success, however, Rangnick agreed to praise.
" There are only two words for this: really good, " he noted.
There is not much to be said.
In particular, the way in which the team plays is impressive.
Let us carry on like this.
There will hardly be any changes to the chamber during the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
" Except for a player occurs with the wish that he wants to leave the club, " Rangnick made clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court ruled today that the health-care law that is closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, judges judged that the single mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to take health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority.
The chief judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy chose against.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 page law and considered that the provision of the Health Law that states should either extend the requirements for access to Medicaid or otherwise abolish all state Medicaid funding tions was not unconstitutional.
The proceedings against the law had been litigated by 26 states and by the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decisively rejected in 2012 by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney.
Norway: Norwegian place presents itself with gigantic mirrors
With huge mirrors the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light into their darker valley.
Due to the low level of sunlight, the Rjukan, in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three giant reflectors at a height of 45 metres, on Wednesday a dream of the century came true.
" Finally! ", mayor Steinar Bergsland warmed at the start ceremony on TV2.
Some valley residents used their sun chairs, others used safe sunging sunglasses.
Sun riders had to take a cable car to a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to steer the rays into the valley with mirrors.
This basic idea has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally approved the expensive project of KK 5 million (around EUR 615 000).
A similar construction has been providing winter sunshine for several years to the Italian Alpine town of Viganella.
Post barely empty on Sundays
" Many citizens will not have noticed yet that the red points for Sunday sleing are still in various mailboxes of the core city and the parts of town, but you read the small print on the yellow yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find that the laying no longer take place on Sundays public holidays ", says the FDP.
A request from the FDP has confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays are are tied only in front of the post building at Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether it is eased on Sunday in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in the answer to the FDP request.
The FDP spokesman for social and youth policy policy, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to catch up here.
Sundays sleeve is an important postal service, especially for forward post.
" Despite the increase in the price of letters in January 2013, this undertaking is thruning out radically and unreasonable ".
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Liberal Group and City Association, supports his colleague in the group:' What annoys me is the fact that the laying times are being secretly tly changed or deleted here'.
The post office is a long way away from being close to the citizens.
" At least the letter boxes in the city districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be eased on Sundays ", says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
It also applies to the core city, especially non-mobile fellow citizens, should be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday sleots on foot.
Röhrenbeck beck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning to talk to the post office about this matter.
Erich Maier ier said the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
To his knowledge, however, there is also a Sunday sun in Hofheim.
Your party has, of course, in favour of privatisation.
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere, " said Maier.
Frankfurt Parking Charges sharply

The possibility of parking directly in front of the shop is " a not to underestimable advantage for smaller retailers ".
The transport club Germany believes that an increase after two decades is' quite appropriate and in fact long overdue'.
Public transport becomes more expensive.
City of joy: Rapid action trumple hosts
Lords I the TSV's Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb with a narrow cadre.
The elders were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
It soon soon emerged that even due to age, they could not entirely keep up with the rapid actions of the pleasous cities.
The Gönninger were extremely difficult with the hard and placed surcharges.
Repeedly they missed the passports and attacks that were played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz clean over the center of the net and were not in place for block defense.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the pleasure cities in all matters.
In view of this oppressive and determinant performance, the third set was won somewhat lax and luurless to the 3: 0 final score (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).
The TV Baiersbronn will be a much more powerful opponent on November 2.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt opposite the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points, especially when accepting the ball; even in passports the precision sometimes was sometimes scarce, and in some very critical game scenes the zepeness prevented the eye for possible point gains.
In this very well balanced meeting, Marcus Blasutto ’ s TSV team, however, agreed with the great physical commitment and a pleasant commitment of both teams.
Day of Care at the Small English Country Hut
On the now fifth day of care in the wake of the Natura 2000 project of Upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.

You need these free connections to preservation.
Tribukait said that she did not want to miss here to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure will not only be seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offered the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the achievements achieved with the Life project, as well as the previous care days.
After these various presentations, project manager Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been being beaten in advance and the forestry tractor was ready to call if necessary.

Google, Samsung, Huawei, sued Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, on Thursday, an avalanche of complaints for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that he outbid in the Nortel auction of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei, and four other companies for patent infringements in the United States District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
Patents concern technology that matches Internet search terms with relevant advertising, the complaint that strikes the core of Google's search engine business.
Represrepresentatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google ’ s Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of more than $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and recently offered $4.4 billion.
After being an outbid by the Nortel patents of Rockstar, Google Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was partly motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
“ Although Google failed to acquire the legal patents at the auction, Google violated, and continues to violate the patents, ” wrote the complaint suit.
Rockstar is demanding a high compensation from Google because it asserts that Google's patent infringement is deliberately, according to the accusation.
Egypt Sworn First freely elected President
Mohamed Morsi is sworn into office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of Egypt ’ s political disputes.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt ” when he was sworn as the country ’ s first freely elected president, taking the successor of Hossni Mubarak, who was been expout 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world, and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He laid the oath in front of the court's 18 judges, dressed up in black robes, who has his seat on the Nile and looked after an ancient Egyptian temple.
“ We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic, ” said Mursi at the solemn ceremony, broadcast live on state television.
“ Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability, ” said Morsi, a 60-year-old, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had mostly been sharply targeted as a banned organization by the respective government since it was founded 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers guarded the building, when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in the court to cheer the new president, and, unlike the presidential Mububarak prunk, traffic was only stopped briefly to allow the autoconvoi to cross the usually animbusy road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
As the Brotherhood ’ s uncharismatic “ spare -wheel, ” his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as an Islamist candidate but all those who wanted to target the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“ Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state, ” the Morsi dressed in a blue suit with red tie explained to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he was sworn office.
Later Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he should make his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel playing the national anthem, which he listened to in hadperformance.
The military leader field marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of people in the university ’ s largest auditorium with chorises of “ The army and the people are a hand ”.
Creed in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970 ’ s.
On Friday, Morsi symbolic oath in Tahir ’ s Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led ted Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaimed presidential powers that the the ary Council had assumed from the ted head of state.
However, by putting official eggs before the court and not before Parliament, as is the customary of the case, he is bowing to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi ’ s Tahir Square speech was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek takes care for two great evenings.

Rapists in South Africa: Twice Life Prison
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to life twice on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim later died from the consequences of serious injuries.
Johannes Kana was found guilty of crime at the beginning of the week.
The act caused horror throughout the country.
The then 21 year-old raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours, the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so horrific that the carers and sisters were in need of psychological support.
Kana had admitted to have been in a bar during the Tatnight with Booysen.
He also admitted to have beaten and raped them, but denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially started from several perpetrators, but released two suspects from prison for lack insufficient evidence of the evidence against them.
The public prosecution service also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is already almost part of everyday life in South Africa: there are already around 64 000 cases every year of sexual violence.
This is almost ten times higher than in Germany, which, with 82 million people, has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women ’ s associations in South Africa, however, estimate the rate of darkness in the case of sexual violence by 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest Ham
Jumbo looking for the " best ham in the world ": the Pro7 star Bonndorf visited for the TV show " Galileo ".

16,000 keys per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what quality is about.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
High-quality television?
Details such as the ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the flesh, the higher the ph-value.
" I am curious when Roberto Blanco meshes what happens, " said Jumbo cynically.
Here, the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
However, it is still worth looking at.
The viewer can see that the dismantling of the columns is still a manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the mixture of spices with the salt.
The city o is the one of the the largest cities in the of the world. With the city of of city, Jumbo is one of the world ’ 's largest industrial cities, and is located in the the heart of the United States.

You thought travel agencies were part of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the entire year and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects adjusted pre-tax earnings of between $325 and 340 million, compared to $305 and 315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are met, this means growth of 12-17% compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011-12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved 8% profit in the first half and made a strong start in the second half, especially in Australian and British private business.
“ Our ten countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year, and some are well moving toward record year revenues before interest rates and taxes, ” he explained.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which is typically one of our strongest performers.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, balancing a slightly weaker market for business travel.
It did similarly well for Flight Centre's leisure activities in the UK, while business customers also spend less.
The US business recovered from the weaker first half of the season, with an expected profit for the full year for the third consecutive year.
Yesterday, the Flight Centre ’ s shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar.
In courses on English literature, students will now have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a ninete-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
“ unread texts ” are also included in the exam in order to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, students will have to pass an stand-alone GCSE language exam, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will tomorrow publish the new English and math curricula – the first subjects to be radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will change next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Supervisory Authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures including a new namotsystem, and less course work.
In a summer speech, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a “ broad consensus that we must reform our audit system to restore public confidence, ” stresising that the GCSEs would become “ more challenging, ambitious, and stricter. ”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours a year, or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
By contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, the coalition circles say that comprehensive mathal testing – combined with greater weighting of the profession in rankings – is likely to encourage schools to take more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on “ real-life problems, ” including financial mathematics.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
The next Ecumenical discussion forum on Monday, 21 October, at the New Museum of the Castle addresses the subject of " On hell with hell - Theological considerations on today's handling of the last things ".
The lecturer is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant church communities of Salem, Salem Castle and Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to examine in the forum the question of how today people can classify the " last things " after death.
If people had known too much about this in the past centuries, focusing on those images of the heaven and of hell that " characterise our ideas to today, " the contemporary, prophetic doctrine of the hopes of completion is more characterized by a certain embarrassment or even helplessness.
" The greater hope has been driven out to Christians by religious criticism, " says the speaker.
She' provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks'.
Johanna Rahner continues to say:' But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death'.
This raises the question of that longing,' dreaming that in the end everything will be good'.
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in Dr. theol in 1997, also in Freiburg, Germany.
The Habilitation for Fundamental theology and Ecumenical Theology was followed at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität 2003.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has studied Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.

By receiving the Firmsakrament, young people said yes to their baptism, and inherited the power of the Holy Spirit.
The firmware had prepared for the big celebration in recent months led by Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of many members of the community.
In various projects they got to know various tasks of the Christian congregation and together together the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: The second mountain bike race will enthruse participants.
In good weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the round course over the hilly chains around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel shares this with the organizing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially at the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude, there were also numerous cycliclists who wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two top German German junior riders have also took part in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel, from Aach-Linz, won good places at the German Championships.
As was expected, the two were able to move away from the field.
As in last year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advance to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was able to place himself again in place two.
For the ladies it was Theresa Duelli of the team nightmare who made it at the top of the winner's steps.
On place two and three came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen.
A welcome development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of sportsmen has been represented.
The age structure also ranges from ten years among the youngest to over 70 years among the oldest starters.
This year even more absolute top athathletes were launched in the main race.
Four drivers were able to distance themselves from the top regional drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a semi-professional mountain bike expert from the Black-Tush Racing Team.
Pangerl, together with a team colleague, was already world champion in twelve-hour driving two times.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
This also includes Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls his own two German champtitles in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, a squashing finale in the finish line in front of the Three Sea Hall.
Pangerl raced first over the finish line.
Only one second behind it, the routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure his second place in the overall ranking.

Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race in the women's ranking.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.

Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend treating hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 of the CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched how his sick father time and again his consciousness and travelled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First he had only a broken arm, but an inflammation formed that spread to his brain and caused a hemmatom that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, ” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought it out of Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“ It ’ s not easy, ” commented Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock and run to the hospital to be the first and you are not first.
There are many patients.
Some people die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell ’ s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States lies with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroons could not afford to visit.
Two out of five in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country ’ s health spending is private.
“ The only problem they have is poverty, ” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his countrymen suffer gave Bwelle the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his voluntary team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME that travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his voluntary group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he, and up to 30 other people forced himself in minibuses and drive with the roof of the medical equipment roof over unsecured terrain into the villages that need help.
Everything is not always smooth.
On more than one occasion, they have had to push the vehicles through rivers and sludge.
But when they arrive they are received like heroes: a feast, singing and dance and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wave ve – with its broad smile and its limitless energy – is happy to attend the happy celebration.
The next morning the team then begins investigating hundreds of patients.
“ We treat 500 people per cruise, ” says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 km around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others are given crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school, but that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team carries out simple operations with local anaesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or apartment; after surgery patients stand up and go to the relaxation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the P and disinfection equipment is supplied by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a hard work effort, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“ They are drumming all the night to stay awake and continue our work, ” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work that has been done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year, knowing that its work will make a huge difference difference for the people it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a body break that he had received now allowed him to work again.
“ This changes my family ’ s future, ” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he financed 60% of his non-profit activities, according to Bwelle; the rest came from private donations.
" I really do not know when he slesleeps, " says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University, in Philadelphia, the second year and works voluntarily in Bwell's group.
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support a wave of support, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
“ We can be involved in operations that help to clean up blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle, ” explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitary material.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes care of the accommodation, transport and instruction.
“ There is no doubt that he is a hero, ” says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no limits.
For the wave, the near-constant work is not a burden.
He is delighted to help others live a happier life, fulfilling the promise he he made to his father.
“ I am so happy when I do this work, ” says Bwelle.
And I am thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to make people laugh again and to alleviate the pain.

Excellently Fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's Novelle " The Old Man and the Sea ", is Horst Janson cut on his body.
Janson is himself an old hase in his profession, the art of acting.
The old man Santiago cannot deceive the old man when it comes to fishing.
In this way, the two simply complement themselves marvellously.
It is almost possible to see the rinkles in the neck of the old man that the fisherman boy Manolo talks about.
If Santiago is tired of life, bent on the chair, that is real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman through and through a character role that Janson mastered excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and will.
Janson is the only actor on stage over long distances.
He manages to focus the public ’ s attention, so that his monologues are not a moment boring.
His efforts to finally the fish to the surface of the water are so real that spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance he puts into light the each active scene: the Santiago hut, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, which expresses Cuba's feeling of life with her songs and her wonderful voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
A sewage channel from the Roman era is preserved at a length of about 120 metres below Cologne.
Those who visit Cologne will not pass by the cathedral.
The two towers rise into the sky for about 157 metres, making it the second highest church building in Europe.
Few visitors who look at the two filigree church towers imagine that there is a lot to discover even under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the Cologne underworld.
The meeting point for its tours is the service center of Köln-Tourism directly at the Dom.
The tour begins in an unspectacular way:: " We start in the underground car park ", says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a city that was appropriate to the car, and therefore, because of the remains of the old city walls, only that stood that was not too big.
That is why most users of the car park are hurry past the Roman remains today and only park their car.
But if you look more closely, the parking deck D2 discovers an archaeological site separated by metal grid bars.
There are about five meter-high ruins made of handle-sized stones.
" These are the remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century after Christ " says Schulze.
Before going back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants take a look at the upper park level at a sinister, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately not even noticed.
The next station of the tour is the Prätorium, where the participants climb back down to depths.
We are here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the founder of CCAA.
A visitor would like to know what CCAA means.
" The abbreviation means " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippininsium ", which means as German as " City of Roman law and city of the Agrippinenser, founded under Emperor of Claudius at the place of Altar for the imperial cult ".
And the Prätorium is the former palace of statues, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the entrance of the exhibition, a tunnel leads to the Roman sewage channel, which is preserved here at a length of about 120 metres.
" You can walk quietly along a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want to, " Schulze encourages the guests.
A surprise still has shoulders.
After collecting the key at the box office, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep walkable shaft.
" We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath, " he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground in order to come to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual washings.
Until today, at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be seen by the alternating levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work will begin shortly.
However, it will still take a few more years to complete.
Bones almost hook: New Rocker Process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is reopened after over four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous body injury and damage to two 30 year-olds has begun before the District Court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants remain silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and, at that time, were one of the bandidos.
The public prosecutor accuses them of having admitted and intervening on three men in a car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man had almost lost his leg.
The victims are to have heard to Hell ’ s competing group.
One of them is said to have been a high-level member from Berlin.
Apparently to be preceded by a tracking hunt with several cars.
The charges were about reversion fighting and a demonstration of power.
The two accused had been acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
A court spokesman at the time that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and were not recognized.
The Federal Court Court removed the judgment after the revision of the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office and referred it to the District Court for further trial.
One of the accused is currently in open execution because of another offence.
The starting point dealt above all with the reconstruction of the procedures in the Tatnacht.
The Commissioner investigating at the time was invited as a witness.
The focus was on mobile phone conversations defendants and other people intercepted by the police.
What is difficult is that Rocker almost always adhere to a law of law, rather than say, in court.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had picked up.
Public Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor in Frankfurt (Oder) said, on demand demand, that new traces had been isen since the last trial.
Eleven further negotiating days have been set for the process.
The Disable Society Think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but eventually it goes home.
However, the hunger is evident in the arms of the people on the front-passenger and the back seat.
Of course, some cocktail or champagne may be responsible for this!
What is more obvious than chilling to the next Drive-In in order to give yourself a little bit?
I admit that I am happy to participate in fast-food sto, late, or early in the morning.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then nix like from home and into bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco singers emerge.
Because what do you lack from throwing your fast-food bags out of the car window on a regular basis?!
Discaraway paper bags are on street edges and car parks, especially at weekends.
'Why?' I wonder.
Are people too doof to take the bags with or home until the next trash bin?
It is not just the case that the paper tool obscures the landscape.
Tepts have already obscured transport facilities, such as road maps, and have given rise to accidents.
But it does not think about what said " disposdisposable society ", presumably it does not even know what this word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a backbank can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage are up there.
A few bags there would not more or less make no difference either - unlike the street, where no one wants to trample on another food's food remains.
I can already see the day coming when cities and municipalities are being blinled to to move away - and the fast-food chains have to demand Pfand for their bags.
Obama ’ s Health Delay
After fierce criticism yesterday, President Obama puled back on his often repeated, clear promise: “ If you like your health insurance, you can keep it. ”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurer received a letter of notice, the Republicans have accused the President in recent days that he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relatified his original pledge.
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them, ” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports of the dismissals, Obama called on those Americans who have received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or less expensive than predicted.
“ They get better, ” he said.
The government called it as little surprise that the 5% of the population who have insured insurance would have to look for a different rate, because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“ I would like to say to these Americans quite directly: they deserve better, ” said SebSebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, explained that the launch of the online platform had been “ miserable ” since October.
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else, ” she said.
I am determined to regain your confidence.
This statement of an upraised Sebelius as an adviser behind her at yesterday's House of Representatives hearing was received after a dispute with the Republican parliamentarian Billy Long of Missouri about whether she was obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly pressed asked why the “ architect ” of the Affordable dable Care Act had not voluntarily abandoned state-sponsorsponsored insurance to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov that she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
The Jerusalem Government does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Base
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous on Thursday claimed to the American news station, CNN, that Israeli combat planes had attacked an air base in Syrian Latakia one day akia.
According to CNN, the objective was' missiles and related equipment,' which the Israeli Government had feared would be intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been attacked in the night from Thursday to Thursday, and held the Israelis responsible for this.
Channel 2, channel Israel showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, showing Russian S-125 Newa defensive missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles, according to Channel 2, with a range of 35 kilometres, allowing warwarheads to transport up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain the Jerusalem Government has not officially confirmed the attack.
But the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli Israeli government official, saying that he believes Israel has launched the attack, but is not sure.
One spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said:' We do not comment on these reports'.
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried earlier, partly successfully, to deliver ground air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would crossing a " red line " followed by a military response.
John Kerry states in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has “ gone unreasonably too far. ”
John Kerry impwith an unexpected admission to a shift in the US ’ s defensive stance on surveillance programs by saying in certain cases espionage had gone “ unreasonably too far. ”
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he coolthe responsibility with Barack Obama for switching to “ autopilot, ” when explosive revelations by Whistleblovelations Edward Snowden about the NSA ’ s spying activities became public.
Information leaked has thrown the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
In a video-linked speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry himself said: “ There is no question that the President and I and others in the government learned of things that happened an autopilot lot simply because the country was able to do what dates back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War, and to, of course, 11 September. ”
He then became the first senior member of the US administration to admit that US espionage had crossed a limit, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, ‘ In some cases, this has gone unreasonably too far ’.
The President is determined to create clarity and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one must have the feeling that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process.
But Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that its surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added, “ We are dealing with a new world where people are prepared to blow up themselves. ”
There is radical extremism in the world, eager to kill people, blow up, and attack governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happened?
We have in fact prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have heard of such plans beforehand.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel the concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue with the US in anti-terrorism efforts, as the chairperson of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs stated on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke with representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations because of the frustration with monitoring by the National Security Agency.
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism, ” said Murphy, who is sitting in the Senate for the first time in the democrat and acts as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger, through the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have strastraed relations with some US allies, although this week, the head of the intelligence service said that the reports were accurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents submitted by Snowden that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other other leaders worldwide.
James Clapper, head of James Clapper, defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared that this is common on both sides.
In all this turmoil, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the trip of the Congress that is to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members are to be published in the next few days.
He said that the exact route was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some “ serious words. ”
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the nature of the espionage programmes that they themselves have used for years.
“ While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect Europeans ’ rights, they must also resign to the fact that we are not the only ones to spy, ” ” Murphy phy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is scheduled for a trip to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend, to address resentment about US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.

Thailand ’ s Australian Pail Call
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for wrongly claiming having been raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June of having made a false statement after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours of Sunday 10 June, while two other men arrested it.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed she had safely entered her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
Phuket police interrogate Bamford for two days before they invented the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the ground.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day sentence in a low-security prison facility on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League who has ached the Foreign Ministry in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about his daughter ’ s daughter and wanted to have her back in Australia.
“ We are very concerned, of course, but we hope she will be back home as soon as possible, ” said Tunks.
Bamford appealed against the judgment and is free against a bail of 50,000 Baht.
Australian reports reported that in the meantime she is on holiday in the holiday resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court said that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult jail.
However, after the recent assassination of the travel driver Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to improve its troubpressed tourist image, and thus gain an acquittal.
