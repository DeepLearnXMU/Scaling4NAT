Gutach: Increater Safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 metres apart: on Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian light was commissioned in Gutach at the village car park - within a viewing distance of the older town hall light.
Two facilities so close to each other: Intention or a coup d'elism?
This question answered GutGutach s clear question yesterday.
" The town light has been installed at the time because it ensures the way to school, " Eckexplained yesterday.
The traffic traffic lights safe both cycyclists, bus passengers and BergBerg's residents.
The plant, officially into operation yesterday, is important for the cross-section section of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
We have a museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank, as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › Grub ‹.
" With the levels of traffic and pedestrian traffic a another traffic light was needed to ensure their safety ", says Eckert.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold of the council of Offenburg.
" According to current measurements, the B 33 daily runs through about 12 000 vehicles through the commune of Gutach, of which about ten per are ted to heavy-goods traffic, " stresses Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of a further traffic light is more than necessary: " Safety is just first here ", Arnold old.
A total of four traffic views were made, a roundroundabout was planned, but rejected again of the conrowcer area in the crossing section area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before at the selection of traffic traffic polsts before: " By means of an extra extra for us loaded with particularly long logs logs of logs, we have ted ed to to whether these vehicles from Sulzbzbachweg can be extended to the B 33 without reangcking the traffic light post ".
The EUR 15 000 approximately traffic light light itself is the " most modern modern there is on the market ", explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that illuminshine so strongly that the lights can easily visible by car drivers, for example, when the low low.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system which is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian moves the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, the green immediately comes to the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
A additional radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be completed.
" If a group or people with disabilities disabilities to cross the road, the greening period will be extended extended, means that everyone comes safely via the roadway, " explained Arnold.
Of course, the car has to think of here as a partner and watch the roadahead.
This was not the case yesterday: just after the traffic lights light for pedestrians green, a first-class vehicle smoked through when the lights was red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The disasters of his Catholic Catholic village children - the speechlessspeech, the inclination crute violence and blunt sexuality, the conrowness and lack of joy - have been described described by the Carinthian poet many times.
The Büchner laze-ate is known known as a prosaauthor, and theatre texts are scarrare in his work.
Collage of prostexts GerGerhard acher acher for his performance " Weatherlights on the tongue tip ", which can now seen in Garage X on Peter Peter's Square, thus creates a collage of prose texts.
The theater maker, for example, combines elements from the autobiographical novel " The serf " (1987) with prosamsaminiatures from " " pse, Belbeling his family " (2003).
On the largely vacty-empty stage an important probit: a naup sofa sofa on which an idea of copcopied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble is on a griack on the text material.
In this respect, director Fresacher seems to trust little in the text.
The 70-minute performance overdes es the template with a plethora direcof that are known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms.
The actresses in particular the attention in the sometimes somewhat dubious interpreations.
They are touched hard, dipped with their head under water, acked with their evening robes on the wall.
Fixpped in cellellophane or bothers, they stroon dangerously high stisties through the stage, either monologize them loudly or lie completely quietsilent on the stage floor.
However, the text is little translated in this hard way.
The best moments will be best when you are sung - the spectrum ranges from Deep purple to popular folk music.
Only towards the end does the over-twisted performance begin to rest, and Winklers barely faps of absurd humour.
Is a black box in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaping highway system, and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that can find its place on the dashboard of every car.
The equipment that records every kilometre driven and report the information to the authorities at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outete financing system for financing US roads.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparkited an intense debate with mulcolful alliances.
Libertans have allied with environmental groups and argue that the government can use small boxes to record the kilometres driven – and possibly also where they were travelled – and then use the information to calcultax judges.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is deeply concerned and raises a number of data protection concerns.
But, while Congress cannot agree on what to do, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently considering how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per per mile driven.
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachographs, of which come with GPS monitoring.
This is a a must for our country.
“ It is nothing that we only possibly use, ” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles driven by all state an Califor’ an motordrivers from 2025.
The way in which we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund financed from the taxes paid Americans at the petrol pump is bankrupt.
But in America does not do fuel as much as it did before.
Cars are consumme less petrol.
The state petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre)) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians don ’ t use gasfufuel prices to raise the tax by even a cent.
“ The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable, ” says Lee Munnich, an expert in traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs intended to test a milebased payment system.
“ This is the most sensible alternative in the long term ” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a lebased user fee.
Not surprisingly, urban liberals sympathalong to the idea, because the tax could be, for for example, to influence driving behavior so reduce concongestion and climate-harmful exhaugases.
California ’ s planners are counting on the system to develop strategies to achieve the federal state ’ s ambitious ambitious climate-change targets.
But the Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also said that he this as the most viable long-term alternative.
Frefree marketers of the Reason Foundation are also attracted by the idea of paying drivers after travelled distance.
“ This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole, ” explains Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People are paying directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American Transport Transport Ministers who, in a 2011 report, called on Congress to move toward milebased settlement.
The US Senate last year approved an expensive $90 million pilot project to involving $10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House Representatives prevented the advance, responding to the concerns of MEPs from rural areas, who represent people who who in everyday life, often to many many miles to miles to work or to city.
Several states and large cities are nonetheless moving in this direction on their own bat.
The most committed one is Oregon, which is currently 5,000 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees to the state, instead of the oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering such a too.
Illinois is limited limited tests on lorries.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, PPennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida Florida, is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hhit.
In Nevada, where recently provided 50 volunteers with the appliances, motorists were skeptical that the government could prosecute each of their movements.
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem, ” explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategic and Results Management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport in Nevada.
People did not want it.
When the test was launched, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into full-size surveillance devices. ”
There is no need to build a giant, cumksome technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now out for affordable technology that allows the state to track the kilometers they travel but not exactly when and where.
Kh, he said, would also rereassure public opinion.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not originally up to help states with tax taxation on drivers.
Rather, their aim was to gain a ground in in a emerging market for insurance insurance with drivers to pay based on driven miles.
However, the equipment it tests is also of interesting to road planners because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“ People are more incwilling to participate if their speed and locations are not be recorded, said Ryan Morrison, Chief Executive Officer of True Mileage.
Major mistakes were made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much less cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this.
In Oregon, planners experimenting with giving motorists a number of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without a GPS.
Or they do not choose any equipment at all and instead pay a flat based on the average mileage elled by all residents of the state.
Other bodies hope to sell the concept of a distrful public by providing the devices with more functions than fewer less.
In New York City, officials want to develop a taxation device that can pay parking fees, requires to insurance only for kilometres driven, and real speed data to be collected in ed from other other vehicles that allow drivers to avoid traffic jams.
“ Driists would be motivated to participate by added value of the benefits that the system system offers, ” stated in a planning document for the city.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether all of the talk about paying per mile is not just just a huge diherring.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for San Francisco Bay Territlast, officials said that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the on tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual charge could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that too can pay a fair share.
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin sufficient, ” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's head of Law and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will be anxious about their privacy and many other things.
Small Team Team ats Big
The volunteer fire brigade managed its Herb with test successfully despite a lack of personnel.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had in his practice als selected the estate Feder in the Burgberger Straße.
A short circuit should to have been made when sawing.
Through the fire and the development in the smoke, two people were injured, one of them was able to send an emergency call.
Two respiratory guers in the dam after the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer agreed to enter the building.
After a short time managed to find the first person and get to the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase could also be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stshed for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There stored a lot of wood and straw baleds in it.
In addition, there were electrical machines for woodwoodworking.
The first extinguishing attack was place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried ected via an overfloor hydrant at about 100 metres away.
Three deldeleoperations attacks have been designed.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also used the exercise to show out what can be done with few available staff.
In an emergency, support will be provided through the Königsfeld daily intervention group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Netof universities and business companies important
During his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarald district, district President Guido Wolf was also made informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where tomorrow ’ s workers come from.
At the HochschwarForest ald Development centre he he together with the managing school heads of the vocational schools and of the district gymnasium and the parents ’ advisory board, considered this important issue.
" Education is an important location factor, " underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule School, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
At this time Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, the Wälderstadt has had a successful cooperation between the funding centre, district gymnasium and the vocational school centre.
He addition prapraised the friendliness of the family in the district.
" It is important to look not only at the family phase, but also due to demographic change, also the phase aimed carcaring for loved members, " explained Wolf.
He also mentioned that an increasing more employees were taking care of for and care for their relatives.
" Without the employer' employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end of employment relationship, " Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
" Because anyone has already come to know the advantages of the region during their studies, with his acquired knowledge and skills will often be preserved by the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region " the President of the Regional Government was convinced.
For, only if sufficient training places were offered can the need for skilled labour also be met.
In his opinion, the district ’ s advantage advantage its favourable location in south-west western Germany in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg he saw efforts already already made to develop local public transport.
'Persevere persand and that public transport is a better,' he said to the local government representatives present.
Experiing an afternoon afternoon of entertainment with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting DiDietinger seniors for coffee, cake and thereon to a vper.
In the past, elderly elderly were served in the resting place.
Meanwhile this afternoon takes place in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The local residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was a sausage salad.
Silplayed performed popular melodies with Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich.
The over 100 years old natural stone wall as the front boundary between the old school yard prior to renovation to the Kirchstraße will once once again be included on the reation plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days in front of Kilbig the first renovations work of front school yard included a small angle wall for stabilization and static relief of the natural stone wall over over one 0-year-old wall with a balustrade.
The next procedure intends, according Alexander MisMisok the BräunlingCity Building Office, to include the Regional MonumOffice in the planning and to prepare a renovation concept for the old wall.
After sequently, a cost calculation will be made by experts, which will then put on the table of the local Council order to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision on this should probably taken early early next year.
After the restoration, paving and tree planting of the old school inner yard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912 12 in the foreseeable future, as a follow-up measure, the demimary wall that in need of renovation must be renovated renovated from ground up and placed on new substructure.
The historic, hundhundred year-old old imwall of the old school yard to the Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water water and frost, since the absence of drainage, is in need renovation and has a forward lined incforward.
Deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage, but the wall is currently at danger of collapse.
A solid wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which was done by the current fortifications.
Originally, the school renovation was even planned in 2008 2008-2009, but high unscheduled expenditure resulted in a shift.
An important word in the historical restoration of the walls, which has already been used for film ming, will be mentioned by the State State MonumOffice.
If there come from this side, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from monument tuectors.
Students of Bräunlingprimary ementary school which are now taught in a well-renovated old school with a new apula, can soon use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to be jazz jazz in Stuttgart.
Now the ongoing discussions about the future of music schools in Baden-Württemberg have been joined by Cem Özdemir, Federal chairman of the Greens.
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the University hochof Stuttgart, " Özdemir said the " Stuttgarter Nachrichten ".
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location of Stuttgart.
ÖzdemÖzdemir,, who is Stuttgart as a favorite for a a direct mandate in the German estag elections on on 22 September, is thus contradicwith the Green Red Provincial Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this group forces a reorganisation of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
After sequently, the course of jazz and pop op will be relocated from the University of Music Stuttgart to the Academy of Music in Mannheim.
US border:' super tunnel' discovered for drug smuggling
On the MexicUS border border investigators have discovered and decommissiondown a' super tunnel' for drug smuggling.
As US customs announced, the more than than 500metre tube between Tijuana and San Diego had been equipped with electricity, railways tracks and an ventilation system.
Three suspects have therefore been been arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana seized and almost 150 kigramgrams cocaconfiscated.
The tunnel is reported to had not yet been used.
" These cartels are stupid to think they can dig themselves under the radar, said the Attorney General of Southern Southern District, Laura Duffy,, at a press conference in front of a warehwarehouse in San Diego where a end of the tunnel had been tunnel.
Duffy pleured to the drug gangs:' If you continue to build such ttunnels and try to use them, we are determined to turn it into a huge waste of your dirty money'.
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in ongoing battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Expert construction
Because of the extensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigassume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction would take around a year.
The track system was so equipped, that there electrically operated cars could be used.
On the Mexican side, there is a building that is 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a conductor leads 20 metres downdepth to the tunnel tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a section of 1.20 m high and 90 cm wide.
It would also have been been placed to encourage illegal immigration to the US.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine Federation.
The third, a Mexican, has been arrested for the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened with the maximum sentence of life onment, as officials have said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, as the San Diego press conference further said.
However, it is the first time cocacaine been found in such a tunnel construction.
Coally ine cocaine smuggled in smaller quantities, not through tunnels.
This shows the " despair " of the drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug search of the DEA in San Diego.
They would do everything they could get reach the US.
No details were made ed about the arrested, at at least one MexMexican, it was said.
They can count on prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 Will ns the Geisinger FestYear
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen to of 1250.
recururence of the first mention in the is is ever closer.
When the year comes to an end in just eight eight weeks, the anniversary year is approaching.
Geisingen and Church Hausen were first first mentioned together a document back in 794.
A document has been produced in churches where both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there is to be an official start to the anniversary year, and as Geisingen currently currently no no hall, this kick-off event will place in the the where where 1250 years ago, both were mentioned for the first time, in church domets.
Within the course of the anniversary, several events are planned planned in Geiingen as well as in church domets.
Kirchen-Hausen wird im Juli an einem Festwochenende vom 18. bis 20. Juli die 1250.
Celating a coming again.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
At the end of the festival there is also the HausHausChurch Festival.
City music director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the sun parcelebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in der Arena with fireworks and on 13 as the first concert of Stadtmusic in the neue Festhalle.
This will be finished and inaugurthe anniversary anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary a new chronchronle le will be published.
" But it should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen themselves, but a printed work on today ’ s Geisingen, which simply consists of Geisingen, church domets, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen ", says Mayor or Walter Hengstler.
And also the Geisingen of today is celebrating 2014 birthday; in 1974 today ’ s space ality was completed with the commungregations.
The new chronicle is to be presented presented 21 or 2November November at the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also a year of many anniversaries.
Die Narrenzunft Strohglonki beginnt am 8. Februar mit einem Brauchtumsabend anlässlich ihres 60-jährigen ehens, die Harmonie Gutmadingen wird 90 Jahre und hat am 29. März das Festbankett und feiert dann vom 1. bis 1. 4.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen becomes 40 years old, the Geisinger Schule is since 50 years at the new location celebrrates this on 10 May, the music verein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this in part of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first in document in a certificate of gift donation that was the owned by the St. Gallen Monastery in 764.
The document was produced in churches (Hausen) which was then court place.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
There is reason 2014 to celebrate this 1250 year 2014,, addition addition, the municipal reform is also 40 years ago.
Council Targets Track Systems
Is the " Am Hirschen " railway crossing to be extensively constructed in order to improve traffic safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided decided.
Schiltach will have to provide EUR 220 000 for this purpose.
Deutsche Bahn is planning to improve the Kinzigtal line in the coming year.
Special aim is to increase safety at railway crossings - there are are collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout Germany.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must contribute a third of the costs, the rest will share the shared and the federal Government.
Schiltach ’ s city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the crossing to the bridge " Am Hirschen ".
There the city plans to build an bulge ge in the level of the tunnel mouth, to the west of the railway track.
There, even larger vehicles, for example those carrying long wood, could be standing on the road traffic, without having to block the tracks.
Griehaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall wall so that the city wiwiden the road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversial discussed in the municipal Council, because some Councils doubtioned the need for road roads: Thomas Kipp summarized the the critics his statement:' Do we need to take so money into our hands on the account of so few vehicles?'
Mayor Mayor Thomas Haas objted: the railway crossing " Hirschen " is used regularly for the transport transport of long wood.
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area partly transported over this route because vehicles up to to metres re long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they were not able to turn there into the main road.
In addition, the route serves as reversion for vehicles vehicles that may not use the tunnel when the main road is closed Haas argued.
Since it is anticipated that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel would have to be built and reconstructed, as is currently the case in Wolfach,, the railway crossing over " Am Am Hirschen " could also also have an important importance for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to have an study into costs of the imagected expansion of the road.
Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the railway crossing was largely approved agreed on the condition that the necessary supporting wall be built in such a way that the city could extend the road following direction to " Bahnhofstraße ", if necessary necessary necessary, for meeting traffic of about 5.5 metres.
The reconstruction of the railway railway crossing at the Trautwein ein ton, could lead to a completely different problem, which relates to access to the sharpastly rising " Geroltzhäuser Weg ".
The administration had had the conversion plans of the railway by the Breinlinger engineering office because it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Wegway would then easily possible.
The investigation concluded that the could not be ruled out that the degree of inclt on the road could lead to the cars being longer cars.
The city, in turn, bears for this as road ad-carrier.
The fication could therefore give give rise to liability disputes.
Since both wood deration and bending in the current state of construction worked, one one not not agree the reconstruction of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
Also at this point the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle on the is significantly lower than at other railroad crossings, because it is directly next to the stop point, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to been slowed down at this point to to would be no collision.
A majority were refused to to the of of this railway crossing because the city of Schiltach should' take the' for the problem with vehicles sitting vehicles', according to the councils, as the railway could withdraw out of responsibility after completion completed the construction work.
The committee sees no problematic with conversions at the railway crossings " Vor Heubach " and " Vor Vor Kuhbach ", for which crossing agreements have already been made with rail.
Esa decides on large Space missions: Billions Missions
Far planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European space Agency will now have to reach agreement on two major projects that they want to launch in the next few years.
30 proposals have been available, five are still in the race.
Far ar worlds.
More than 1000 planets have already found astronomers from other stars.
Whether there are lives on at least some of them does not know.
The choice is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or rather rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or searching for earth-like planets and perhaps discovering extra-restrithly life?
These are the questions facing the leaders of the EEsa Space Agency.
For their " Cosmic Vision " programme they are seeking ideas for two major space projects that are intended decisively boost research.
The budget for such' L-missions' is approximately EUR billion billion each.
The launch is expected expected in 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite elite European European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were under discussion, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Numerous bodies are examining the proposals, are up the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the scientific programming committee.
A total of four major questions were selected the Esa to answers the missions of the " Cosmic Vision " program launched in 2007.
What are the conditions for the of of ets and life?
The precise processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets that circle bit stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared infrared telescope could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planet, under what circumstances can life be there?
To investigate this question, the space Cheops ope escis to be launched in 2017, which is to to in detail 500 known planetary systems in our vicinity.
The possibilities are limited are limited, cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map earth-like planets even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, looking for " biomarkers ": gases that are regarded as an indicator of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately ultimately ate what conditions there exist for the emergence of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interactions of its magnetic field, as well as the the particle radiation ating from it ets.. The planet.. an important role. The magnetic activity of a star is an magnetic important is the magnetic field of magnetic magnetic field and the particle radiation with the planet system.
In our solar system these processes can be investigated exemplarily.
With the solar orbiter the Esa has already approved an M-class mission (with a budget about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is scheduled to start 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and his moons.
Find out about the role role the Giant played in the development of the solar system.
For this the Esa foresages the first of the three L L missions of the " Cosmic Vision " program.
The probe " Juice " (Jupiter Icy Moons explorer) will begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later she she reaches Jupiter scheduled to study the atmosphere's the planet and the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the most physical laws of the Universe?
The space offers many opportunities for study studying matter under extreme conditions and order to examine whether the laws of nature that we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there will also be variations that could show physicists the way to a new theory that can encompunitogether all the known laws of nature.
How did the universe evolabout and what does it of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos emerged from the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we composed of stars, planets, and creatures like us, there is dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clutogether, and dark energy, whose actions acceleraccelerate the expansion of s space.
So far, researchers have not know what what physical laws were valid in the first frafrasecond of the big bang, and what what dark matter and dark energy compup of.
With " Euclid " the the sa has also already approved an M-mission that is scheduled to start for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe should study the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time over the entire sky and thus allow some conclusions on the composition of dark matter and Dark Energy.
Who could Race the Race
Of the 30 proposals, only two two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chances of being approved as an L-mission is, in many experts, " " E-Lisa ", a ambitious concept detdetect gravitational waves.
These mean physicists the changes in spaceal changes that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not not been proven date.
Elisa could do that, hoping the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides ees a detector of two or three probes to stationed in space.
Unlike contrast to plants on earth, it could also waves of gravity generated from the big bang, thereby providing new knowledge about the emergence of the cosmos.
Four more proposals still compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray called Athena called Athena ena intended to investigate black holes, " Icy Planets " to mission outer outer of the solar system, Pprism, Prisrism " mission a cosmic survey survey measuring cosmic background radiation, and the Exoplanet Finder, to detect and study earth-like planets.
Already left ted, there have been proposals for sample back transport from Mars, for research of the moon, Venus and asteroids, and as solar physics.
Snowden ready ady “ “ cooperate ” Germany Germany US US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the intelligence intelligence whistleblolower, said that he is prepared to travel to Berlin ttfy to the German parliament if if the National Security Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander give no answer about their activities.
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was received asylum to discuss the asserony in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden presented to the media in Berlin on Berlin on Friday, he wrote wrote “ “ Although the of of my efforts has proven positive, my government continues continues to treat a dissent opinion as a fialty alty message and to to crimincriminalize political expression with criminal, in which no defense is possible. ”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he believes the international community ’ s support could could persuade the American government to drop the charge against him.
The charge brought by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
The Interior Secretary Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich, told time online: “ If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to representatives from Germany, we will find ways to do this. ”
US-German relations are stradened by allegclaims that the NSA has retapped on Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the Muty who leads parliament ’ s intelligence committee, said that one should take ze the opportunity to to Snowden as a witness if if possible “ without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US. ”
Ströbele, a deputy of the Greens, published published photograph of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists when he visited Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to Snowden, the former NSA ’ s lawyer, he cannot return to Russia if he leaves the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is “ safe, ” ” the MEP said.
Snowden says in his letter that he would be exposed to a “ serious and ongoing ” proseccampaign, which has expelled him from his home.
But it has been touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression. ”
Citizens around the world, and senior politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a credit to the public.
In his letter, Snowden gives the German authorities an offer to cooperate “ once the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation are solved. ”
Frontier Airlines charges charges for cabin baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 from passengers wishing to stow hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to USD 100 for a piece of cabin baggage and USD $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though it was stated in the announcement on on Wednesday that passengers were allowed to keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the above compartment, small bags under under the seat free of charge.
Frontier declared that it charge USD 25 if if the fee paid paid in advance and USD 100 for travellers who paid only at the boarding gate.
Frontier-spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the fee of of 100 100 aims at getting ting travelers take care of upstream payment.
“ We do not want to calculthis amount, ” she explained.
Airlines began in 2008 to charge the first and second and second checked piece checked baggage.
Passengers who tried to avoid them have therefore dumpcked into much hand luggage luggage as as possible, which means that the baggage comare often overded above the seat.
Charges are one way of persuading passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making making money.
It is about Frontier's most loythful customers, who would clearly clearly that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space above the seat above the partment.
Passengers purchasing your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a piece of baggage at Frontier gate free of charge but the next person may be have to pay USD 100 for a similar piece of baggage.
O'Malley stated that Frontier's website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they came to the boarding gate.
Frontier Fronnew hand baggage charge only only into force in the summer and there is not a exact date yet.
Passengers often complult about baggage allowances and other charges, but airlines are happy to use them.
They argue that transporof the baggage should cost money and passengers should pay this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are collecting enough money to cover the cost of flying after years of losses.
Most, however however, leave the fingers of the cabin baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand baggage three years ago, and followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the airline advisant Jay Sorensen, who is closely following additional dues.
In a report of December 2011 he estimated that the hand baggage fee Spirit generates USD 50 million a year.
Sorensen, who was a a leader of Midwest Airlines, recently fw Spirit, and was curious about what would expect at the boarding gate if passengers were confronted the company ’ s unusual hand baggage fee.
“ The boarding process was one of the smooth smoothly experienced in my career in aviation, ” he said.
I awaited to see gngnashteeth and tangible discussions at the boarding gate.
‘ The plane was full, ’ he declared, ‘ and boarding ran like luascated. ’
Frontier also follows Spirit with the $2, which is required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice were allowed to keep the whole cans, and coffee coffee be refilled free of charge.
Water continues to be free.
US Airways had made short attempts to for money for soft drinks in 2008, but rolled it back seven months later, passengers had complained and no other major company had followed suit.
Frontiers step to charge for cabin baggage if passengers do not buy directly from from airline airline is the latest initiative that seeks to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay for online travel agencies such as Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to encourage passengers to buy directly with them rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the most in this area.
In September, the company began awarout half as many frequent flyer miles when it booked through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, miles were cut once again to 25% of the route.
An journey booked with a third party with a Frontier of excess than 1000 miles will therefore only only claim 250 miles.
Passengers can also book seats only buying directly from on Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal client base at its headquarters in Denver, but its business is decking and it losing money.
Profrevenues declined by 9 percent and flight capacity shrank just under 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report that was published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Airways Holdings Inc Inc.
Republic has tried to manage Frontier ’ s finances through its society's sales.

NSA declares an “ internal error, ” not hackers, is responsible for the website ’ s crash
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that a bug had held their its public site to a for some hours, not hackers, as was claimed online.
“ NSA.gov was unreachable for some hours this night because an internal error occuroccurred during a projplanned update, ” explained the espionage agency in a message sent via email.
The problem will be rectified this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a widely distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening, online online trackers noticed that the NSA website was unreachable for least least six hours and still remains not for some users.

Secret information is not in danger, according to the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to paralypled the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is loaded with page impressions until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber tactics is relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to invade the target system's internal network.

“ The test aircraft did not stand down any longer than expected, ” ” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that during the aircraft life of the aircraft was subject go ground tests and software updates.
Each manufacturer has a different plans.
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a period for review, which we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight programme.

Basharat Ditta, 42, passed ded to Earth NNeil Scarborough
The lawyer was feared that his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known penal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because being fear that his secret addiction addiction could be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld greatet Neil Scarborough with sensitive information into his activities in the drug trade, after having been compromised by his own cocaine diction.
The criminal-hailed as “ first class ” lawyer nicknamed “ Bash, ” arrested in his house in 2011, after police police monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug case.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) three bags of cocacaine from the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lashire, while she was with colleagues at a dinner in the bar room.
The investigation made revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after after traces of cocaine had been found in his hair, in his wallet and in credit cards.
For eight months, from January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men men for Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police during a major investigative case into the in heroin cocaine trade in Lancashire, CumCumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, were later arrested after the police conducted a series of house searches involving heroin and cocaine ine valued worth £1.5 million and £200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals, fearing that his addiction diction be made public.
Today, Ditta, who works for ForForSolicitors firm in Blackburn, was convicted at the Lipool oler Crown Court following a three-week long trial on two two charges of obstrucranjustice.
He admitted ownership of cocaine at a previous consultation.
The lawyer was convicted after the police discovered in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigating officials followed the suspect and wathow he went to Ditt’ s s house and put the drugs with a 60% cent purity in a black golf love love the lawyer lawyer s dustbin.
Shortly after supplying drugs, Scarborough regularly called Ditta at a dinner dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, seiup the drugs, and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
It was known in court that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests were used to detect class A drugs in his hair, his wallet, and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine, said that had talked to the susped dealer he being his client, and claimed that her discussion was subject to the lawyer secrecy. ”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and and a sample of hair hair.
In police interrogation, he said that he was an an office under his private address and at the workplace, that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It has been known that he had called on key drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, to aled for significant arrests and briefus what the investigators knew about them.
ProProsecutor Anne ne Whte said said “ A criminal prosecprosecutor should know better than anyone else that you will not break the law. ”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a defender because he got engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug traffick, but a drug traffickler who supplies drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his communications fications were doubt legitimate, because he was the lawyer for these people.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal lawor-client relationship.
He counteragainst the police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta has brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough and his his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied all misconduct and claimed that “ If I were a corrupt lawyer, which am not,, and I was wanted to give information to Scarborough, then I would not wait for 15 hours, I would it immediately. ”
But, the hearing hearing Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said: “ Mr Ditta took the step from a penal defender to a criminal at the moment that he began to buy drugs from organized criminals. ”
His dependence on cocaine led to a hopeless compromise, made him receptive to the motives of by leading members of the organized crime who instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence trust and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide himself behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit LLashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and judicial dranment, underunderoring our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals, showing that nobody can escape the arm of the law.
We find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being guilty of conspiracy to trade in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published a question with questions about herself about in which he claimed that that his dream job was to represent clients as lawyer on the death row in in America, his ultimate guest at the dinner would be Mohammed Ali, and inequality of opportunity be the motivation for his work.

traffic lights for Perual red: Keep Wawait
Sometimes a traffic light simply does not turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not rereact, or the light sign is ective.
What should we do then - drive on red?
If a person concerned has ited long enough at a red traffic light and the intersection is free, he can continue on driving explains the StuttgarStuttgart orney Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad ".
However, the waiting time must be' reasonable', which could be interpreted differently on one case case to case.
Becker advises to stay for at least five minutes before any traffic light malorder can be expected.
However, anyone who continue the journey despite the redghts ghts to be aware that they are entirely responsible for an accident that this caused.
Anyone who tolerates for less than five minutes may not be waiting long enough, warn Becker and point to a decision of the Upper land Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic light after three minutes minutes of continuous red and had to answer answer for negligent red light light ence.
The traffic light was not broken, but jumped to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the particular situation - but the fine was not.
Local Council is joices at a Sound Budget
Whenever it comes to the budget in local council meetings, mayor Ralph Gerster has laued well.
The municipal packery in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled, and lihas has no longer been known to the administration since 2005.
The 2012 year 2012 can also be considered a complete success in this respect.
This was clear during the presentation of the accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget budget was higher than planned at around EUR 7.6 million more over EUR million million.
The surplus in the administrative budget also also about EUR 1 million above the approach at around EUR 1.8 million.
Thanks to the surplus surplus surplus mainly to higher business tax revenues and the community share of income tax.
The wealth budget, too, was well above planned levels.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million foreseen, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
'This is mainly due to the increase in allocation from the administrative budget ", says Rothmund.
Since fewer investments were made than was planned in the financial year 2012, the reserve allocations has also been higher.
In total, the general reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster expressed many thanks to Rothmund and her team for their good work.
" Such a work does not just shake out of its sleeve, " Gerster praised with looking at the annual accounts.
He and the local councils were obviously reiced with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures may soon cost citizens dearly.
Due to its financial finances, the municipality was able to ego high loan rates in the past.
This in turn however, according to Gerster, national subsidies were often cut.
There are prerequpreconditions for these subsidies from various compensatory batines.
Among other things, the towns and municipalities that apply for subsidies must show certain lerates.
" We need to look at the issue of lerates because there there be investments in the coming years for which we would like to receive subsidies subsidies, " Gerster announced in this context.

In the case of a café of the café of the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight of the Rhin-Waal University, it does not t have to be with a pure Déjà Vu feeling.
After all, the café with its beautiful name aims exactly that: to make a real stay not only tually tually but but tangible to experience again and again.
Because it is fun and is simply beautiful.
A look into the inner life at knostop 8 gives the viewer a good feeling from the go.
The ultra-modern, but not cool café atmosphere looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team with its its founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner, pil il guests with a different variety of coffee or cocktails.

Two events were two events in the bright cafe.
Better to say one thing.
Because the port festival did to take place outside - Café Déjà Vu did not take benefit from it.
But there was also the wigling natevening.
" Happvely, successful and funny ", found both 33-year-olds.
But not everyone ’ 's business.
Perhaps that is why Daniel Büttner is not a specific fan of event evenings: " You can't t it right everyone ".
And with an event, I address only those, who are also interested in the special event.
That is why events will be the exception for us.
" We want to disturrupt the normal operation as little as possible ".
Let other say: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here as well as to the team and the beautiful surroundings at the top in Kleve.
The road that is increasingly developing into a gastronomy item.
To the delight of many Kleivers, guests from near and far, and the students who who discover for for themselves the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu.

Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre MapMapto under the watchful statue of of Samora Machel, founder of state and first president of Mozambique, to to calls for peace at a rare public demonstration.
“ We want peace back again, we want stability, ” said Mr Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Far of the future of the country, she changed her business clothes for a T-shirt with the label “ We Demfor Security ” in Portuguese, and on joined joined join crowcrowd in the capital ’ place of independent space.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel bel movement, initially by the whites e-ruled Rhodesia and then by South Africa ’ s apartheid in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government.
Following the 1992 Peace Treaty, the country became an opposition party.
Analysts believe unlikely that the country will reverp back to full-full-lown conflict, but recent events have troubled foreign investors and locals.
The stakes stake for the rapidly growing economy, because discovering discovery offoffshore gas deposits and coal storage in the northwest could bring more than than $50 billion investment in the next few years from firms such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni, Italy Anadarko from the United US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blaming each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacked its members on October 17 in the province of Sof, a traditional stronghold of Renamos.
The attacks on the previous rebels escalated when government forces attacked RenReno bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group ’ group ’ leader, explained Renamos ’ spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to underplay concerns about instability.
Speerning AFP, the French news agency, he said Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself as a “ loser, ” “ wanting to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government. ”
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
However, the concern have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
In ed to the FT, he explained by that he meant that Frelimo no longer respect the agreement.
“ Our vision is to resume open in serious negotiations, ” said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to alluse the tensions that were fured by a number of clashes this year.
“ We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) clashing heads heads, ” says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiate and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pressing for electoral reform, has already said that she boyboycott November's local elections.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial perks from the government.
Renamos's electoral success has shrlining since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renama member, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – who will resign when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy.
“ He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to give the presidency, ” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what Renamo's capacity, but she has made disturbing attacks on police stations and on on important North-South connections.
Most of have taken place in the Sofala province, which a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, using the port, the mining companies, such as Rio Tinto into and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio halrupted use of the the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded cautently to the asked whether Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted “ warn the international community that things are not well in Mozambique, ” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased frustration with the government,, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent independent media company because because many people were already concerned by corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidducapping.
“ People think that the government and president are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be one finding solutions to the problems, ” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people simply wanted stability.
“ They do not interest Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again and usable roads, ” he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as role models of life, ” one author says.
The Thor stories showed that “ brute force has no chance to fight clever tricks, ” and the Arus legend legend ates the importance of having a dream.
But many of the myths are “ far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to taught in schools, ” is why Crossley Holland has called for a “ careful selection selection ” works of ancient age.
“ I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklare already a part of education, ” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that authors and teachers who are “ excly didactic ” would “ “ shut off children off altogether, because entertaining stories would convey the messages “ subliminal. ”
Crossley Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon language and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said, “ You can have certain intentions, but you should try to keep them in the background. ”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children lies in the need to provide hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminal presented and history reveals reveals, not explain.
This is the old story story rather than nartelling.

Rumors of a Clararke affair were first picked up by NotW ’ feature editor, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawwby by was said: “ Don ’ t waste your time, it ’ s up with Charles. ”
A volume with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was seized in August 2006 in the apartment of Mulcaires.
The investigators also found entries on the detective ’ s computer on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ Projects..
During the time the research were underway, grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking for information about them, explained Edis.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter, Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup, oversaw Pawlby ’ s movements.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her with a voicemail with the following: ‘ I have a story that we are going to bring out tomorrow, which I would like to talk about with Charles. ”

Ginging: No Total Protection Possible
" We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at early stage ", Mayor Jens HHäußler opened the civil information event on the concept of flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants came to the municipal hall to have explanations for measures the planned taken, to ask questions, express concerns and to submit ideas.
Häußler made clear: " The final decisions are taken by members of the municipal council ".
The floods, which hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009, unprepared was a drevent that raising the question of protective measures for the future, says Häußler.
A river basin study was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen which now forms the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
" To protect as many cultivated plots as possible is the goal ", says Häußler.
What is basis is the planning of protection against floods statistically tically 100 according to the German ather Service every 100 Service.
Climate change will be with a a 15% supplement.
Specispecialist circles call this as " HQ 100aKlima ".
The quantities of water that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponequivalent to a 1000-year flood.
" There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement, " Häußler said.
In order to protect HQ 100aKlima, around four 4 million need to be invested in Gechingen, and the municipality can expect state subsidies in the amount of around 70 percent.
However, Häußler pointed out that there will only be support if an overall concept is implemented.
To this end, the municipality community need the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure needs to be completed.
At best, its implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept that was already presented to the municipal council last week (we reported) makes provision for measures measures in the influxx of the river Irm from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the concept for flood protection, participants took the opportunity to raise their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why more more dams and reserareas were not planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept stressed that it needed the interplay of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal.
Moreover addition they has to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim forest of forest and Corbe.
Disenture prevailed in neighbours of the algate who, even in normal thunderstorrain repeatedly suffer from overload of the canal net.
The problem is known in the administration and the initial measures have been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the directives on canal systems are different than for flood protection, and this should not be mixed.
The municipality shall be obliged to design the channel network in such a way that two- to three-year rain events could be sustained.
Dimening the sewers larger would devdevour millions.
Seriadly Inunded after Clision
In the early Friday of Friday afternoon on highway 44, near Revensdorf two drivers were seriously injured in a headtal collision.
The police blocked the street immediately completely, but initially little could say little about the accident route.
However, there are various witness statements which should be to be evaluated first.
It is certain that the 19 year-old old stever of a VW drove towards Revensdorf and that the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, and the woman was so heavily trapped that the fire brigade less than half an hour to free them from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unresolved.
Both casualties came to nearby hospitals.
The route remained completely closed for two hours.
Call it call the Dostoevsky of the US.
Philip K. Dick was a God seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Amazzling the kinship in outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski is understood with his massive euvre as the founders and apologist of the Russian soul, one read Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, valid in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag and the Haffmans-cassette with its 118 talstories sbutes two-thousendeins.
Dick explains America - the realm of breath-taking technological advances, coupled with paranoia, delsession ia security, and the belief that it is chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer Manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, had added drugs to his brain.
He has realized early on that the computers are divinarities.
He wrote a theology of the computer, asked what distinguishes a human being from a machine the creator from his creation.
That is the Blade Runner problem.
The killing killing.
A master of science science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The " Minderheiten Report' dates from 1956, it exuits the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals.
The principle of " pre-crime crime " is developed here " pre-Crime ", what is now a more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In a thick's world frighteningly similar our own, mutants look to the future - and the police are rising.
" We capture individuals who have not broken any law, " says the head of the authority.
'We take them before they can commit a violent crime'.
And:' There are no serious criminals in our society society, for that we have a prison full of pesudo criminals', they read flows of time.
They assume bad things to happen and prevent the criminal idea from being put into action.
Thick narrative acts like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA's s zy esretapping.
Anticipation of the attack: This is just way Obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dic’ s story does not end yet.
The police chief complains that there is no longer a separation of powers, the military controls everyday everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the watchdog is supervised himself and convicted of a future crime.
The system is turning through.
It is perfect but it is lying.
It invents its own conditions.
Not only do errors and victims toleracceptable, but builbuilt on them.
The system creates the danger it is combagainst.
To p p K. Dick is keep to coming closer to the truth.
Russia ’ s Spst-ale Tonony
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make out in his late ate US affair surrounding German Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German Federal Bar utor could ask questions in writing or also meet the 30-year-old in Russia personally, reported the agency Interfax.
Previously, Hans-Christian German estag, Hans-Christian Ströbele, had yesterday the first first politician to meet Snowden in Moscow, to talk to him about the affair.
SA revelations Reinfy Corporate paranoia over government surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt / Main, Germany ’ s financial capital.
On order from the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism (BV), the German Interintelligence service, he should take photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is located at less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, the BPT wanted to prove the presence of monitoring antenas, and the led to a word exchange between the US and the German State Department in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the US did not resort any foreign espionage facilities “ to steal trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profits. ”
But, since Edward Snowden, the ersttime whiwhistblolower, began publishing his horn of US surveillance secrecrets, European governments and bosses are no longer sure that they can take the director at their word.
Reports that the American National Security Agency has spied the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American Cloud suppliers, including Google and Yahoo have raised the company to a new high to paranoia over government surveillance.
The last w's w was the revelthat that Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone had been aked, perhaps the for a years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then company managers will certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made intense cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
“ Germany must wake up, ” explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now posed almost as as a risk as China in industrial espionage and data theft, a poll published by EY, an advis, in July.
But the leaked documents by Snowden have not yet show that the US has passed on the trade rets of foreign companies to its own firms.
Politicians have expressed their concern the EU should lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies esses sceptical about this regard.
The Bundestag has suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“ That is not the way it works, ” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If we had wanted a strong European IT industry, it should not have been allowed extincout 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany Germany being subsidised, from coal to cars, to agriculture.
Everything, except for the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical sophistication of the US espionauthorities exposed by the Snowden disclosations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China.
Cloud computing is experiencing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject subject to jurisdiction and is therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by Cloud Security Alliance, a a trading institution, after revelations of US data mining activities with prism, about 10% of non-US-resident members rejected plans to use an vendprovider.
Jim Snabe, SAP Deputy CEO, says, “ We are seeing a new question from customers that did not exist a year ago – it is where will my data stored stored and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this legal space? ”
Many German business leaders argue that the most recent recent simply confirm what they already knew anyway, which is that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and so they must be guarded at all costs.
That espionage is taking place is no surprise.
This has always been so.
“ It was a topic for many years and has not fundamentally fundamentally through the current discussion, ” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
Americans are spying us on a commercial and industrial level, as we we do, because it is in their national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate management do not usually boast of the counterthey have taken, because that gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been washleaded that taking away a free USB stick at a trade fair fair or leaving an ununarded leaving a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the Board of directors of Audi, says that it has been been standard practice practice for years to collect the mobile phones in advance of a meeting of a management meeting, so that they cannot be used as wiapping devices.
Germany ’ s BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when they are travelling abroad, because smartphones can potentially be compromised.

CDC Publish Schofor Allergy ergies
On Wednesday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a set of guidelines for how manage food allergies to children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines that the US government has issued, as the number of mandatory school children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now have a food allergy.
The spread of food allergies among children, according according the CDC C, increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that order to make the educstaff and staff staff more aware of food allergies and how they should deal with children that show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools should have epinhrhrines – the auto injection of the Epien is most commonly used – in order to counter a potentially deal hypersensitivity response.
State legislators have recently amended the rules to enable schools to keep epephrines easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: “ It feels like something is is pressed on tongue tongue, “ My tongue feels as if a hair lies lying it ” ” or “ My tongue craingling ”.
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ sex undetermined ”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children born with genitals that are unclear.
Newborchildren are no longer assigned to stlexible male or female.
Under the new law, parents will no longer have to declare sex for such children, but can can state “ undefinite ” or “ undetermined ” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to remove pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on newsex alment ment operations, and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
One intersexual person, on BBC BBC later said said “ “ I am neither man nor woman. ”
I remain the patchwork created by doctors doctors mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated one one in 2children are born born as either boy or girls every year.
They belong interinterals, a group covered by the diagnosis SexDifferation ation Disorder (DSD), a collective for people with atypical mosomes,, germomoes es m glands (ovaries or testic), or commonly developed genitals.
Walliais Simpson was perhaps intersexual.
Understanding gender identification is still not very developed developed, but US experts recommend that the best information available be be locate gender be used if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the child ’ s psychological and physical physical development before deciding – if all – for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who has alizes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “ soundes for a good cause ”.
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“ Some people have life-threatening illnesses requiring require, but the same does not true for most children, ” he said.
You can make a sex allocation ment sex without surgery, and then wait see how the identity identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child actually develops its gender identity is not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It is like the secret of why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexual people should be differentiated from transgender gender or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-related but to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defines both at the time or not clearly clear as one of them.
These characteristics were evident in subordinsexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature ure, priority sexual characteristics such as as reproductive organs and genitals, as well as in chromosomstructures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination intersexual sexual transtransgender in professional life as, as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Young ys who match the gender image now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now for adults adults to state male, female, or “ third sex ” on official documents.
In June, Australian, Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ gender” ” person after a court court maintaining “ “ undefined ” gender status for life.
German cards will have a third assignment in addition M and W in future, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial according to news report in France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators of the stricer-Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from textbooks.
The US Web site Catholic Online has also spoken against German law on the grounds that “ If the world is drawn into a a new state where gender is a, but sexual activity is not not, then we be twisting two more pillars of civilization. ”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to baby zone that she would be better for babies to be assigned a sex at birth.
“ The parental existence is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don ’ t know your own child ’ s sex, ” said the parents ’ website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male male female female of of sex have been described herhermarodidi, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Just ten years ago, medicine regarded the gender as something to be extped ated and then rebuilt.
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being into question now we we know how complex gender identity is, and also that doctors can be wrong, because they do not know what the child feels like it grows up with the sex they have assigned.
“ In the mid-20th century, this was called a a psychiatric emergency, ” said Drescher.
When such a child was born, they called called not the psychiatrist but the surgeon.
The dominant theory theory the treatment of children with ambiguous defined genals stcomes from Dr. John Money of the Johns Hopkins University, who argued that the sex was formleable.
He coined the term “ gender identity, ” argued that social and environmental incentives – as parents raise a child – interacted with a child ’ ’ s genes and hormones, thereby coing whether a person considers himself to be male or female.
But in a 1966 case known known as “ John / Joan, ” his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated by a botched circumcircumcision to cacaate the child altogether and to remove his testicles and then bring up up as a girl.
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion, but which it was not, ” says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male and married a woman.
At the age of 38, but at the age of age age age at thirthiryears,, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990 ’ s, with the Internet ’ s hold, survivors of these gender operations became public who are “ not happy with the outcome. ”
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana born with XYY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
Doctors were not clear whether he had a great clitoris or a little penis, and convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man.
So his external organ and the tesles were surgically shortly after their birth in 1976 and was brought up as a girl.
At he age 12 he received female hormones.
“ I knew I ’ m t a girl, ” he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At 18 18 he should be given a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical files.
What he discovered was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth birth and nobody has ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals.
After having out the truth, he switched back to a masine identity, was given testosterone injections and and his his him to his breasts removed removed his breasts ((((((((his (, (his,, he the the, he he he to to male male, his male to to male male identity male identity identity injreceived injinjections ections testosterinjections and removed his breasts.
The operation has the him infertile.
Today he is campaignfighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to that intersexual people be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, the director of California-law group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that German law can “ encourage stamped and stigmatisze. ”
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision might encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assiassiate the child into, undefined, ” she explained.
We fear that this will favourable to intervention.
We think it would be better to assilocate the male or female sex and then wait.
But we do not yet know what the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports Australian law, because “ it allows adults to be recognized as the third sex. ”
“ Adults were to be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex, ” she explained.
German law is about the adbution ment at birth.
This is not a fight into which you should compel young children at this time.
When they are adult, they can decide on their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast diologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds others in a self-help group, says the German law “ emoriates ” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with a male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete drug resistance.
Because of the defect in the recepbed of target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
It has a vagina, but no uterus, no no ovaries.
Today, Katie 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania and works in child psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to be able have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“ The law gives room to parents so they do not have to rush to make decisions, ” Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do various tests and clarify things things, thus giving them time before they write “ male ” or “ female. ”
In this way everything is all ay – you pulpull the child up and love it.
They have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parental happiness.
And you do not have to rush to an operation that cannot be undone.
“ This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear iety by parents for thinking they they are doing the right thing, ” she explained.
In the end, the child decides on the sex that better suits him – and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision for themselves.
Unknown ns Inure Girls by Car

Haying With the Future
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives in a fantastic place.
Your house is located in a residential residential of Stuttgart Stuttgart with lot of ery, an old tree, nice nice neighors and not too much traffic.
The the city is only a few minutes by public transport.
" You hopefully are not afraid afraid of spiders? " asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider at the door frame.
I have been searching for new flat for my husband and myself for some time.
However, you do know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
However reason the reason is a spider phobia, but the concern about no longer be longer be able to cope with the many stastasteps leading to the house and in the apartment, she explains.
Furthermore: since a Meniscus operation operation the mid-fiffifties has had to experience her first hand what it means to move from floor to to floor with handicap.
Just recently published a book by her on the theme of' Happily in Old Age - What form of housing is the best for me?'.
'Our appartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age', she begins to say.
When she moved to the maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was simply a beautiful apartment in the midst of greenery.
Today in the mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks a a about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people ever deal with the subject of living in old age'.
Most people crowd out it as long as it can.
Old is always only the others,' says she says smiling.
Only when the suffering pressure is really great do we think.
" it can be too late late then,, Ries said.
In her book the interior designer presents 17 living models for a self-determined living in old age.
'Which form of residence you choose is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e there is no solution for old age.
Even those who can afford the olage retirement ite in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could also become ill.
And:' Without good knowledge of the national language, you also unite in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist book says those those who would intplanning to to emiettile.
Among their models there are classic care models, alternative forms of living or the frequently cited pensioner ’ retirement provision.
When old, everyone has their own ticks and mmbks
'For me, such a living would be but nothing', says she says with a wink.
Not at all as in a student's shared room with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'When old age you simply need your's s retreat rooms', Ries said.
The fact that a senior citizens community can still function does nevertheless nevertheless does not to exclude the author.
However, this, have to done differently than in the classic Studenten-WG.
And sometimes you just want your's quiet', believe her.
She is not alone in this opinion, at least in the country's capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as it goes' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the civic service of life at the age of the state capital.
Your department advises people on the subject of becoming an elderly.
That is why older people in particular would often accept inconveniand restrictions, only in order to be able to stay in their familiar surroundings, that is also the experience of Stiftung Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment for barriers.
Ries recommends that everyone who deals with renovbuilding their house in accordance to with their age that they first obtain themselves thorough information and not not entrcommission the first craftsftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for reconstruction appropriate suit the age.
One thing or things can be achieved in the rented apartment and if if it is just an increase in toilet seats, then explained fies the interior designer.
But the existing apartment cannot always be designed according to old age and thus free from the barriers, even matter beautiful beautiful it may be.
Waltraud Ries to experience this experience ries.
Although there could be a inside the apartment, this would be the bigger obstacle.
She will continue searching until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move it gragraying more from more than before the spider on her living door.

Recent statements by Snowden would nothing to change either.
Previously, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele, following a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, appealed to the US not to continue him further ishsanctions against him.

During my work in these institutions, I witnessed witnessed systematic violations of law by my government, which out of moral duty prompted me to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I found myself exposed to serious and persistent har forcing me to leave my family and my country.
I am living in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by resonance of my political actions, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged revelations about a system of comprehensive surveillance that is answeraccountable to anyone as a service to public public.
These espionage revelled to many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the once-veit abuse of public confidence.
The benefits to society derived from this knowledge are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time the risks taken have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been proven positive, my government continues tretreat dissent as trustedie and and aspves to criminalize and prosect political expression.
Nevertheless, pronelling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will the end of this damaging attitude.
I hope that once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate and legally in the responsible clarification of the facts regarding statements made in the media, in particular, regard to the truth and the authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and I thank you for your efforts to comply with the international law that protects protect us all.

The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, “ Double Down: Game Change 2012. ”
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that presidential presidential top advisers had conducted extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to see whether Obama ’ s better off off ’ s waning hope of re-election if he drop Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times national policy correspondent, the book thoroughly paintraces the history of the efforts of campaign leaders and of the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure effect it will have on poll ratings of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for Vice President.
The potential change was a tightly kept secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, Obama s former former campaign of ad, Jim Messina, and the White House s former senior adviser, David Axelrod, and David Plouffe – knew about the imagected change.
“ Double double down, ” claim that Daley headed the efforts to BiBiden despite their “ close, personal relationship ” before finally deciding against such a move, after data data that Clinton Clinton ’ s s candidacy would would not significantly improve improve Obama ’ s chances. ”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had, indeed, considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“ I said a whole range of things to consider, and that was one of them, ” explained Daley to magazine.
It should be remembered that the president had terrible approval ratings back then, so we thought, “ God ’ s sake, what we do? ”
While Daley described the investigation as “ due care, ” ” Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that a considerable deal deal was made during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a train would pay out to the ballot boxes.
“ In campaigns, not so much money is spent spent on surveys and focus groups if you do not really think about something seriously, ” explained Martin on AC360.
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin said to CNN that he had Daley ey his then boss was aware about the potential change.
Although Daley explained that he does not believe that the president was “ “ aware ” of possible change, the former Chief of Staff admitted that it had been “ possible ” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that “ “ double down ” not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political soundings had been reached.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously seriously think that Obama did not aware of the investigations into whether one should drop Biden in the election.
“ Possible, ” Martin replied.
What happens to my email on the road?
Email is actually known as electronic letter.
Was the confidentiality of correspondence in the design of the Internet service service technically technically, as that in postal mail?
During the design of early Internet services the focus was to make communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not taken any to create a firm foundation for a audisecure exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user " Anna " sends an mail to " ni ni, are the two computers connected directly?
Anna ’ s e-mail program or browser sends in the first step to the service provider ’ s mail server.
For example, if it has a GMail account it is Google.
This mail server sends the content to the ISP that Benni uses.
During the route the mail can be on several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content from its provider.
Are conventional e-mails read on their way through the net?
Most mails are read by software robots several several times on the way.
The sender's s provider is usually checked if the mail contains a malicious program as attachment.
A virus check is also performed on the receiver systems.
The providers also check if this is an annoying and unwanted wanted spam that is be deleted or at at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots also have a additional task?
On systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs for placing context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate by GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can provide relevant links to holiday offers.
Even unknown unknown people read the e-with?
The probability of unauthorized people reading a mail is extremely low.
But in theory, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means to intercept or receive emails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying ying.
Is it possible to protect emails from being read along?
With an encryption to the OpenPGP standard an e-mail can be encrypted encrypted against reading.
With great technical effort it is also possible possible conceal the metaddata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not easy to identify who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
The mainly privately-mailmailYahoo Yahoo Google play a minor role in Yahoo and Google according to an survey conducted by Convios Consulting in August 2013.
While the shares of Yahoo Yahoo's mail had last fallen, GMail was Google to rise up significantly.

Want ancy an ice cream shining in the dark?
One British entrepreneur developed the first dark-gshy ice, using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of flufluorescent properties of marine and created a glight from it.
The idea came to him after reading a research into jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to make the shining protein artificificially.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when eed, which raises the pH value in the protein and releases gering the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream will react to the heat in the mouth and glows so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company, Lick Me I'm Delicious ” says, “ The product is incredible, but is at a very production stage, you get two grams of it for £200. ”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice ice shining.
We tested it in the last few months and it seemed like ideal bring bring it to Halween to market because it has this wonderful glowing effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made, because the jale luminesum is four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball costs me in little like £140.
But to do this, it is delicious.
Charlies's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its latest creation should become even more ambitious.
He says, ‘ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream. ”
This is in itself impossible because of the breakction of light caused by the crystcrystals make up ice cream; but I suspect pose we will find a way to create it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellfish yfish ally made by Chinese scientists

Like we, Daververalso rely on tempo.
That is why we must keep our our rate of error.
However, it is primarily important to increase in the coverage, which most last left anything but a certain impression.
Daverdens's Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against the Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that ’ why we are far from being the favorite, because everything in the Derby can always happen.

Halloween 2013: In Figures
When I was small, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dresise us for the neighbourhood.
Today I became become a Halloween muatle.
Over the last two years, I have not agreed to hand distribute sweets from my home and I do not will to do so this year.
But according to the statistics, I am a black sheep for Halloween.
The majority of Americans – $158 million to be precise – this year will celebrate Halloween with a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and decorations, according to the Retailailers Association (NRF).
One thing I really look forward to every Halloween again is the trend values.
The costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year, engantching animate items are the last cry.
Women no longer need to wravelop themselves in sexy clothes, they can now embody tempting food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men I expect expect plenty of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the aft punk space spacesers will it it this year ’ s instagram feeds.
According to Google, the most sought costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect pose there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and I amazingly, we were not alone.
Indeed, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, says the NRF.
These are a lot of hot Dogs.
Regarding sweets, we are not squeeish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate atoribars, slichers, swedies and rubber bebears.
So good news for according to the US Department of Commerce, the 41 million people ling through the neighborhood with the phrase “ sweet or sour. ”
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let ’ not delfool ourselves.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugarsweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilolograms are sold around Halloween, according to the National Sweectionery ProducturAssociation.
That is about nine billion grains of maize.
It is a mystery I have not not solved.
Nothing is more to Halloween than houses where it spits.
They have great names like ‘ Terror Behind the Walls ’ (which is in a real prison), ‘ Howl-O-Scream ’ and ‘ The House of Shock ’.
There are 1,200 officially recognised spushouses in the United States, earning USD 500 million, s to America Haununts includes the wonderful photos you pee in in your pants and put your friends on Facebook where you do not going to get get rid of them, and leaving leave a comment of the type you are on on like a nice nice expression of face..
But let us finally come to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us with the great pumpkin when we were children,, and carving ing a pumpkin lamtern is like decorating the Christmas Tretree – something we have done from a young age.
Fortunately, the “ baby in pumpkin ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up with carpping up the pumpkin, not in sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend $10106 million on pk, to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lattern that rotts slowly in front garden presumprobably come from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of poks were harvested this year.
If you want the right points, call Tinim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something bits from their 921 1ilgram pumpkin.

For today young people, the profession was very attractive and offers good prospects, said Pastor Mathis said castles (43) talking to the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to control the working and daily routine.
The State Church has commissioned castles for the first time to a pastor on a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after leaving school ation.
Burs trace this back to the process of ecclesiisation: " God ’ s voice is quiet, the world is loud ".
However, the profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my diary and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors as seafarers could be very close to the people.
They earned as much as teachers, and could well live from it.
To be sure, free economy economy pays more, but thetheologians have a safe employer for that.
This suits the young people of today, who are concerned not just a career, but a work for themselves.
According to the State Church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastpastors currently retire each year.
At the same time, about 40 students of a theological studies start their graduariat.
In sparsely populated peripheral lying y, such as the resin, Emsland or Wendeland,, it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Burfien to, inter alia, organise study days for young people and also them celebrities who have studied theology.
Studying theology offers a broad education.
You can even become President of President.

Fire fire gade to rescue a pupuy that stranded 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock promontory in a quarry.
Cockerspanielbitch Ruby ran away after a small road accident.
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her prediclocation.
Firefighseicked off the rocky face, and saved the dog from safe death
The fire department managed to bring a pug into safety, which strstuck on a 15 meter high headlead in a rock face.
The nine month old Cockerspanielbitch Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon afternoon and survived on own for three days before she was rescusaved from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend, Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to take RuRuagain and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had searching desperately for their missing bitch and published cricalls for help in social networks when she escaped into the quarry after the small road accident.
Around around 14: 15 on Wednesday Wednesday, a walker walking out his dog saw the strstranded Ruby on the 15 metre high ale in the quarry.
The technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton Fire Station ran to there and ran led off to rescue Rubys, which was transported upup in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist in technical rescue rescue, said: “ She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock face – 15 meters away from top and the ground.
She did not move muscle during her rescue – she was like stiffy.
But now it is doing very well.
She then eaten a few dog pucakes.
It was a rather unusual assignation.
The fact that the dog was discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, the salcuteam technical specialist, said: “ Ruby by had a giant luck. ”
There was a possibility that she had been very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian but who found nothing other than exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “ The rescue was saving frightening. ”
I couldn ’ t even that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in arms.
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have fallen down.
The firefighhave done a great job.
It was really braous what they have done.
We are just so thankful and they all was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keigheighley added, “ We were afraid that it would fall down, but it stayed on top. ”
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains that he never hired Katy Perry when she was 18.

Perry explained that she edinner with the alarm trocker and that “ he ingened me when I was 18 ”.

As representative added, “ she she confconfused him with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the singers who made guest appearance at this year's RollStones tour.
Their new album “ Prism ” ended straight at number 1 place this week.
George Kerevan: European Unbundling Gives Scots Choice
A new day, a new story of terror for independence.
This time we are being warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition of EU membership.
This provides the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and for a barbed wire protected border along Hadrian ’ s Wall.
Indeed, the strathclyde proposal referred to the possible economic benefits of having greater freedom to travel travel the rest rest of Europe, but – dictexpected – this did not feature in the headlines.
Nor has nobody mention that EU member states often bend ent their strict rules when it is better to them.
Since Scotland is not currently in the Schengen area, continuing continued contempt for Brussels would be just a small concession in exchange for what it really want from the Scots.
So not not really a story.
And one that has come so such a way that it already already like a fossil: the first time I I heard “ independence means passport control ” ducduck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the continurepetition of this age-old story.
Why should an independent Scotland be be expected to dance to the European tune?
Why trade the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan to unify Europe after the war has reached a halt.
With the euro crisis, the European project has officially died.
Across the EU parties are gaining ground that are anti-the EU or want to scrap the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany Party – founded only this year – could win just under five million votes in September ’ s s general election, thereby effectively driving elling the Free Democrats (the equivalent equivalent ’ British Liberal Democrats Democrats) of the Parliament.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis proves to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank with the straitjacket into which their national economies are constrained by maintaining the single currency, many many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive excessive budget deficits – this has happened only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pegged its members on exchange rates that are favorable to German exporters – and German politicians would like to do so.
Without the possibility for the local currency to preciate, southern Europe will find itself with an built-in productivity disadvantage relative to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the “ green ” energy imposed by Brussels – a code to subsidisubsidito French and German energy companies, at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice twice the amount for electricity and the United States and four times for gas.
This is a crippling cost disback, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
All wage roll in the world does not protect the European petrochemical industry from being into a corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is rising, especially in France, the EU ’ s former cheerleader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany at check and putting Paris on an par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, pggling a a batterled French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive post-election, placing the ruling socialists in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing division will automatically be an benefit to the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly won popularity working-ing-class white French?
It wants to use next year ’ s elections to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well well in these elections – and this is very possible – then such a block could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
That is the point I will make: in the not-so-distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come ge to do away with the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will, rather become something like the “ Europe of (sovereign) nations ” that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may cling to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distanate itself from this project in the hope of fying up to the US.
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that the UK will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including the saying to Berlin and Brussels what they can put up and where.
I suspect that Scotland could do a very well in a looser European group, if we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other simillik-minded countries is more to in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider about following the example of Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful anti-austerity movement in Europe, and won a spectacular majority in 2011, to the rejection rejection of proposed (and made) cuts cuts mandted by Labour Exury equer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Torory Lib DemCoalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to have austerity austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Faster GroUp
African-American and Hispanic girls tend tend to live closer to puberty than their white contemmers as surveys show.
Physical Change Does Not ImImly Puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less marked among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialising in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried when her daughter's breasts and shamic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the pediAssociation ’ s American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard.
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – this is usually no sign of people are reaching puberty, ” Kaplovitz explained.
Clevious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armphair as well as body odour, are shown earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (appearance of first bloobleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“ When the development of the brebegins, it takes at least two to three years until the Menarche, ” Kaplowitz, also author of the book “ “ Early puberty in girls: The essential counselor for dealing this this common problem ”.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty develops.
It is debatable what really represents the beginning of puberty, but it is “ prematmature ” for breast augmaccompanied accompanied by an ust of growth before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a paediatrigecan supermonitor closely.
If faster progress made, tests could be indicated by an enddicronologist to eliminate out problems problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatment available to delay early menstruation and to itself from another consequence: the premature ageing of bone ones which can ultimately lead to inhiing growth and and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based based on the age of the child, speed of of development, rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctious about drugs, but he adges: “ suppressing puberty can attenalleviate behavibehavioral problems and feelings of girls of being from being their age parts. ”
The other major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their young daughters to have the period.
“ They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or or about they they to handle the hygienic side, ” Kaplowitz said.
“ It was a shock, ” recembers a whose daughter got her days at the age of ten.
Although there were been the first signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came home anxghious and excset from school, because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many extenly-published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence of the cause of hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment, of sexual messages in the media.
Boys come into puberty in a similar way to girls.
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the launch of a study in 2001 on girls aged between six and nine that a link link between body fat and entering puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic ic girls tend to attain of puberty rather than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to the genes.
Another puzzle: although boys are growing growing their of face and shame hair earlier, the trend towards a full-scale early puberty is not as pronounced as for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and shamhair is common among babies and infchildren.
“ We need to be careful about identifying the true beginning of puberty, ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to have their peditheir pediatrician on how to speak to their child.
“ This can mean that you will have to have a conversation earlier than expected, ” et Kaplowitz advised.
When you stay calcalm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloish early need insurance, which that the process is a normal part of life, even if it does occur earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers are arguing seat width in the face of large orders.
There has been a a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the range of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the width of seats offered to on long tourist class flights – not always those that airlines care care most, but this designated space space is the key to the efficiency assermade of the latest Airbus aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week Airbus demanded an industry standard to require an seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the economy class, but the US archarchrival, Boeing says that the airlines should decide this.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to to sell larger versions of their their in-engine long long-range pilyers, are record orders to be orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether whether there are nine or ten seat rows – is crucial for the stated economic outcomes to delivered by the new “ mini jumbo ” design.
Boeing claims that its upgraded “ 777X " fiber 406 people tourist class seats more over 17 inch wide and thus allowing ten per row.
Airbus claims that the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 people 18 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine nine per row.
Aviation giants often spout heats about technical details via advertisements in the specialized press.
Airbus is now appeappealing to the public before the Dubai Airshow where the 777X is is expected to start the race with more than 100 orders.
Recently, it presented an ad that could be the start of a new war of advertising, showing donors with a picture of three people in a restaurant squeezed together together, accompanied by the title: “ Would you accept that? ”
“ Boeing is long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo props, ” says Airbus Head of Sales John Leahy.
Given changes in eating habits, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970 ’ s, the Boeing 747 defined modern modern long-l neys, and by the end of the century, the weight of the average male aged aged 40 and 49 increased by 10%, according to the US Department Department of Health.
The average male size of waist American in the 21st century, according to US health statistics is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that its rival reto a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body range of the newly baped “ Jet Set ” was smaller.
Airbus says that they had conducted investigations showing that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increased the sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing denies Airbus' figures on the seat size and says it is not at the manufacturers' manufacturers to decide how airlines strike the balance between fartariffs and establishment.
The company also explains that according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“ It really comes down to giving airlines flexibility flexibility so that they can do they think they need in order to be successful, ” explains the air cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more freedom of elbows, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that may have an impact on sales.
Behind the is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least USD 700 billion from list prices over the coming decades, which could have a repercussions on on either the US or European export exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating seating layout is the driving force behind the battle over new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain a 20 percent more efficiency per seat on their latest twin-engine, long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements from Boeing about the results partly depend on the 777X being compared with its ten seats per series with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for the machines currently in use with ten seats per line.
“ Boeing is squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products, ” says Kevin Keniston, Head of passenger comfort Manager at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts are saying full ten seat seat per at at existing 777 s indicated that many passengers opted for tiordering, which could be accompanied with cheaper air tariffs.
“ Eighteen inch seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic of view, the Airbus is is controlled by threat from the 777, ” says Mary Kirby, a cabin equipment expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world traveling jet sellers even carry straand-gauths to measure set-up against the competition.
Even if they advertiire comfort, all manufacturers also offer highly condensed jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater rows but, according its own, has not yet sold sold.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of increasing cabin cabin adaptability and offering wide aaisways for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jet, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to aporate, but could distract ct from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotinine vaccine could a pe off smoking pleasure.
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spothe fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Before human testing, further tests are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York has said that the first results are good.
“ We are hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who to give up, trying all of the methods available on the market, but have seen their nicotaddiction is stronger than these approaches, ” Cornell says.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hthe nicotine molecules in the blood and neutrthem before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from experiencing a nicotine high.
In trials, the vaccinated mice given to nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
By contrast, vaccination mice have taken a “ time out, ” researchers declared, a sign that the nicotine had reached her brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Prelier tobacco vaccines ines failed, because they contained antibodies.
Vaccination had to be be so frequently to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower, because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if it is certain, could be administered to children before being tempted to try a cigarette, thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But what is more likely that smokers would use it to stop it.
“ They then know that when they start smoking, they are no longer happy because using the nicotine vaccine, which helps them get of the habit, ” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but they also warned warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies having was influenced by Obeid
The former laboratory party minister, Joe Tripodi of New South Wales, is being investigated by the state corruption regulator.
The former NSW minister denied having changed the rules on maritime leasing at the request of his political political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who had covert holholdings in three properties in state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Commission Against Corruption) on Friday broadextended its investigations into whether Obeid influenced various state ministers to leases ases at Circular cular Circular Quay, the two restaurants and a café without a tender after their expiry in August 2005.
The investigation is now investigated on allegations that Tripodi knew Obeid s disguised interest in the land, following Tripodi ’ s statement from from deputy Chief of Staff, Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
In years of talks, began in 2005, the government had pressed for public tententender for leases ases.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted to have longer maturities.
In 2009, leases ases for companies in Circular Quay, which earned Obeids $2.5 million per year, were extended without public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister for Minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally declared out in favour of public dering.
But he refused not have made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, pushed urged revising the government ’ s lease arrangements.
A telephone signature submitted to the ICAC showed talks in August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who switmoved to the Ministry of the Port after after worked under beid in the Fisheries Authority.
“ Was the issue discussed in those telephone calls about the drafting of the commercial lease arrangements? ” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
No, ” Tripodi replied.
I do not remember what was discussed, but it definitely definitely not.
Definis definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes ets Attacking Syria, Official Sources
Israeli fighter airplanes attacked a a target in Syrian port ’ Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the objective had been, but said said it had been at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was SA125 missiles from Russia.
Israel has already at least twice carried air air strikes on missile deliveries to Syria this year.
Foreign workers with 44visas could be subjected to' authenticity' test
The government is considering, under extended measures, a “ “ authenticity ” test for foreign workers with 447 visa.
If the test introduced introduced it would be used via a criterion designed to prevent the 457 being used to fill unskilled jobs jobs or as a back door for family and friends moving to Australia.
A government's proposed discussion was published today after the former laboratory Party P, Maxine McKew, denounced the government ’ s comments on foreign workers because they might be regarded as insult by Australia's neighbors.
“ Loud statements like as foreigners should hire behind front, ” and letting Australians first ” are a very unpleasant setapat a times when trade unions demanded a protected labor market,, she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this has meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region would see an echecho of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal discussion outlines lines 12 measures once once envisaged by the former immigration minister, Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday yesterday discuss human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still under consideration.
If the ‘ criterion of authenticity ’ adopted,, applying for a visa could be checked to see whether ‘ the application is genuine in those cases which the applicant is related or is personally linked to the the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company ’.
Companies could also be required to provide account for the number of 447 visa holders after, in the past, companies that at initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri riLankan um-is likely died died of a heart attack after arrived on the Christmas island in a refugee boat this week.
The man's disturnine-year-old son, who had come to Australia with him, has been looked after by an adult cousin since his father died on Wednesday, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The British Government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HSS2 project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes the implementation of high-speed high-speed links from phase 1 1 in 2026 between Scotland and the North of England.
Transport Minister, Baroness Kramer said that the project ‘ will bring the UK closer ’ project.
The Scottish Transport Minister, Keith Brown, said he he very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed Road between between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, currently in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a journey time ultimately ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: ‘ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings bring Britain and its cities closer together..
We are ahead with HS2 because it brings huge benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
As Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael said, “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland. ”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to push ‘ ‘ clearly ’ for Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: “ The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits to Scotland, at the same time Scotland economic economic power provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK. ”
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland which is bringing benefits to all and which ements to the Glasgoow-Edinburgh link that is already planned by the Scottish Government.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to jointly deciding on the next steps.
Regulations governing electronic equipment in aircraft remain visionally in force in Australia
Australian passengers must continue to shut off tablets and smartphones on-and off landing, despite efforts in the US to relax regulations on such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read e-books on their equipment during critical flight phases read, watch videos or play games as long as they are in “ flight mode. ”
For the majority of the flight are already allowed this, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books on off and landing.
Australian airlines are monitoring the decision for which US airlines have to do huge amounts of work, but do have no immediate plans to change their rules.
The Air traffic Control Agency also stated that the announcement would be looked at at but underemphasised that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment at critical flight phases still apply in Australia.

The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about extending the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and said that it open to to changes but these will need to be initiated by legislators.
“ We would welcome a review of CASA approval of electronic electronic equipment because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience, that we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight, ” said one speaker.
Qantas declared that it would abide to the current rules for further notice.
“ Our current guidelines state that electronic equipment may not be used at take-off and landing, and we do not have any plans to change that, ” the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in seeing developments in rules that passengers can benefit, and will will certainly look very carefully at FAA ’ s decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has different different effects on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio disruption from mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programmes as, customer customer instructions.
“ Once an airline has confirmed its fleet ’ tolerance tolerance it can allow passengers to use portable lighweight electronic electronic, such as tablets, e-book readers, and smartphones at any sizes, ” the FAA announced.
In rare cases with poor visibility, the crew will tell passengers to switch off off during landing.
The group also recommended sting ing heavier equipment securely above seats at take-off and landing or in compartments.

However, deposit houses offer the advantage of there being no need of of creditworthiness or income proof, which makes it possible to lend more quickly than with banks.
That is why millions of people in the region are turning to deposit houses as families feel the pressure of the rising cost living of living and rising household and consumer debt.

Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the Agency,, have the highest budget debt in Asia in proportion to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the list, with 80% of GDP, with an increase of 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high high consumer debt in Thailand, which has narrowly out from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday the data showed a continued weakness in exports and a drop in consumer demand.
“ In effect, this means that, as costs, middle-middle people (the income income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible, ” says Song Seng Wun, who economan economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices in the last two years have compofied the trend to pledge personal items, as people seize the opportunity to turn family jewellry into cash.

Bailing out Australian $325 million for Tasmanan health care
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions attached with the bailout of over $$3million Australian for the Tasmanan health system to ensure that the state government cannot squander the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic illnesses, and systemic restrictions.
Fundfunding for a period of four years was decided following government consultations with independent Tashmanan MP Andrew Wilkie.
“ The government has put together an emergency rescue package that in our view will address the unique challenges facing the state, ” ” Plibersek said today.
The $335 million package includes $31 million in emergency aid for electoral services.
Another 2,00 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and cataracts c treatments are aim to eliminate residues.
There is also money for day-to-day hospitals in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after hospital stays, training of specialists, mental health services, and introduction introduction a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“ These investments are consistent with the ideas that hospital staff who have me told me are the best way to improve the Tasmanan healthcare system, ” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanan government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional funds was spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides hes health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that set the Tasmanan public health system on a more sustainable course. ”
Nevertheless, he applpraised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, he expressed initially to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“ I am confident that federal aid will go a long way to removing the state public health system off the care list, ” said Wilkie.
According to the state government, these electoral results will largely make up for the recent cuts.
But the opposition opposition policy kesman spokespolicy, Peter Dutton, believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ paster solution. ”
“ We are in the current today because the laboratory state government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system, ” he said to ABC TV.
We cannot have a state government pular almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth puts 300 million and then pretend that this is good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the bailwould be spent on additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for producing chemical weapons and gas munitions, the global global chemical weapons monitoring group on Thursday, while there were collashes in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic toxic substances are be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the the civil war almost three years ago.
The announcement for the Chemical Weapan Organisation (OPCW) announced the day before the deadline:
November November, which the Hague Haag -based based,, Damascus, set in to destroy all facilities for chemical chemical or to them ‘ inoperable ’, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling illing ammunition.
Concluding this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the elimination of all of Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction lifacilities means that Syria Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must to begin to destroying existing weapons and stocks.
It mptions suggest that the country possabout 1,1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including including mustard gas and the sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when there was taking place in the town of Safira when where say say there is a chemical weapons production facility as there as storage facilities, as the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in the UK has said.
The activist group that persecutes the number of deaths via network of activists in Syria, declared on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 6067 were civilians, 6,365 365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them were ed President ashar Assad ’ s army, 18,678 were pro-fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition combatters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number number of the conflict conflict at 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for Safira, many whom have had ties to Al Qaeda groups.
The Centre said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday but did not provide any details.
The fighting underscores the danger facing chemicweapons inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous weapons arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team is now convinced that it has seen all of of the production, mixmixing / filling filling facilities mentioned by Syria and and witnessed witnessed their destruction. ”
Therefore, “ no further inspection activities are planned right now. ”
At the beginning of the week the inspectors said they they had completed first round of inspections and had visited 21 out out of the sites indicated by Damascus.
Due to safety concerns, visiting two institutions had not been possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPWC declared that the two sites, according to Syrian, “ been abandoned... and the chemal-weapons programme that exist there had been relocated to other named facilities that had been inspected. ”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPC inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by OPWC ’ s executive Committee.
“ I salute to the bravery and courage you all showed in carrying out the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation, ” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Sureillance Organization in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad ’ s government and its security forces, which include many members of the Alawites, in a secession of Shia Islam.
For further developments, the chief of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that on Wednesday was a strong explosion in an aborne defence facility in Syria Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Anfury at verdict of Bali ’ s bombers
Survors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing in 2002 were annoyed at the sentence of the last of the instigator who was brought to because, because they view that Umar Patek should be legally shot.
Patek, who flfled ten years as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building explosives for the bomb bing.
If suspension of suspended, it could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which left 202 2 dead, including 88 Australians, and injured many others.
A condemnation was also made on a of terroristm-related charges, including a wave of explosives on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecututor had demanded a life sentence, even she could have applied for the death penalty for the man also also called “ demoolition builfor for calling as master bomber as a “ Demolition Man. ”
The decision has raised painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirors nearly a decade ago.
Figgling with tears she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
“ He should be put before a firing ing command, ” Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see daughghters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when on 12 October 2002, shortly after 11 p.m. a huge bomb exploded in a small truck truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar,, only 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber exploded a rucksack full of explosives.
He fell into coma for a month after the attack, and “ died ” three times while reling to a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserves the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – were responsible for the carnage, who were executed four years ago.
In ally, this type should have the death penalty before everyone else.
To let him alive – no, there is no reason to let him alive.
Gettaining 20 years after having killed 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be trial.
He withed almost a decade from arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces, just four months later, former Al Qaeda ’ s leader, Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of building the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
“ He did not stand, ” said Corteen.
Until recently, he showed no remorse for how much suffering he has caused on other people.
The sentence was issued before the ten-year anniversary of this year's attack, with commemorative ations in Bali and Australia.
“ There will be lots of tears this year, ” said Corteen.
Patek may still appeal against his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic equipment aircraft (but do not call mobile phones)
Air engers can now use their electronic equipment from departure through to landing to read, work, play to music and watch films, but not to call on their mobile phones, according to the new issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the respective airline, as FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Carriairlines must show the FAA that aircraft compform with the new directives and that they have updated cabin crew' training manuals as well as rules for loading equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from airlines airlines expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could very soon approve the expanded use of electronic equipment, ” the FAA announced in a announcement.
At present, passengers have to switch smartphones, tablets and other equipment off when aircraft doors are closed.
They may only reart them until the aircraft reaches a altitude of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When passengers approach landing, passengers must switch them off and not retarting before they has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are safe against against electronic disruption could allow passengers to use the equipment even on take-off, landing, and on the wheelfield, the FAA declared.
Most new commercial aircraft and other airplanes that have been converted for the use of Wi-Fi at a high tudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Professional FProfessional attendants Association, welcomed the changes.
“ If the new regime is safely implemented – and we are working closely with the airline on this regard – it will benefit both sides, ” Glading Glsaid.
Frankly ly we are tired of having to feel like watchdogs on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for browsing, sharing emails, text messages, or or data data under than kilometers remained remained banned, the agency explained.
Passengers are being asked to put smart phones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still not no Words With Friends similar to the Scrabble online game Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he publicly forced to leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to switch the device while the aircraft was parked at the boarding gate.
And heavier equipment like laptops must continue to be ststowed because there is a risk of injury if they they fly through the cabin.
Talking phone phones during the flight will also remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic equipment take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, said that, national safety experts on safety issues on CBS News, mobile mobile phones are still regarded as a risk.
“ Mobile phones are really a problem not only because they could potentially cause disruption in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also disb transmitting masts, ” Rosenker said.
An industry consultative committee created by the FAA to examine this issue, recommended last month that the government permit the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has intensiincreased on the FAA to relax its restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security reasons to ban it.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because use of equipment has become become bibiitous.
Some studies talk about that up up as a third of passengers forforor or ores the switutting off the device.
The FAA began in 1966 ting the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of disturbantions to navigation and communications equipment became known by FFM F radios carried by the at at that time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed designed and approved by by by FAA that they do not make to electronic interference.
Airairlines have been offering Wi-Fi for some years now when they have been reached.
Adapjuadapted to Wi-fi systems are also more insensitive to interferences.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic equipment under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today ’ s electronic equipment generally provide much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when you around.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Advocders of relaxing the restrictions on the use by passengers include Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems but could not detect them.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk involved in using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he thought the interference by the equipment was genuine, even though the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only few reports from pilots advocating interference with aircraft systems by the, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee of the FAFArecommended recommended allowing pilots to order passengers to switch switch off their equipment when instrument landing in in poor visibility.
A group in the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a sensible adjustment for travellers, who would now have ample equipped of technology.
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not inlide ct safety,, ” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Disposed ed ed by air rescue rescue from the North North Sea Dririinsel
A bird flown by air rescue to the coast, found exhausted on a dririg in the North Sea, was released back to nature.
The water traall was flown helicopter to Aberdeen last month where it was was ed up by Scotland Scottish s SPCA to its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: This This track was probably a wintry winter toory from northern Europe, which was held stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea. ”

Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with a intention of bringing the economy around the table and defining what those who deliver wealth and work in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders asking them what they think about Britain, the economy, and the EU.
YouGov surveviewed over 1,000 business executives roughly maBritain ’ business sizes, sectors, and regions.
The results of the poll will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exportoutside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while states in the EU are stagnating.
They would like the government to favor new trade links with countries such as China, India, and Brazil rather than holding back with the long and demanding process of reforming obscure EU institutions.
In they view on certain number of legislregulated – – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be be taken back to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the internal market, because companies said that the cost of Brussels rules now would outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trading zone – even even 40% of the large companies, which have traditionally been the most Europeproist.
Finally, and probably this says the most, our questioning with economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain to take course towards a change of the agreement, and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This insight, shared by companies of all sizes and leaders, shows that the economy is pushing for “ meaningful meaningful change ” that bring the magazine of action back to the UK.
A lot at stake – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain, at 16%, would lead to a change of opinion in favor of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that the British economy is behind his plan for renegotiate Britain ’ s terms for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation to a significant shift in the balance of power back to the UK.
A better deal for the British economy is possible, and increasingly necessary, as the eurozone now shifts toward closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK as the outcome of our poll shows, which for businesses for for focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: YMCA CA are indiccharged with charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual offenses
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with chilsex sex offences before were charges in 2011 against the d-care care, Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as reported by the Royal Commission on Child Sexual AbAbuse.
But, in the opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA declared that “ it had never had to to an incident of sexual child abuse in the organization. ”
CEO Phillip Hare was asked about one case in which one YCA CA had been charged of child pornography offences and another in which a sports teacher had convicted of YMMCA CA Caringbbah Hall in 1991 for abusing children sted to him.
Hare said GGail Furness, a lawyer assisting of the Commission, that he knew about the first case but he did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission was also impaccurate in claiming claiming “ “ had been external reviews of the YMCA, in the the YMCA to recognised having being at the forline of child safety. ”
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it received the second-lowest rating of four possible options in a quality quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, admitted that management had failed “ from me downdown ” to hire ring Lord, and had failed not ensure that employees were aware of of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted earlier this the for sexual offenenses against 12 boys during his two years of service for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
But Hare dised that the YMCA had a cultural problem that dishad prevented staff from reporting Lords's s safety breaches.
The staff said they had observed infringements, including that Lord was alone with children children looked after them privately as babysitter, had them sit on his lap, one of said that he had ves it, and he had children play on his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior Lord Lord, requesting child protection training because of his behavior said that Jacqui Barnat,, Lords ords ords ords ors was “ intimidating and very remote most of time..
The managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dardared report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, it was their their friendship Lord Lord affected her judgement, which is why they had not notified him.
Hare explained that he had informed the of Board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson the organization has to learn from the “ Jonathan Ford incident ” incident “ did not concern the reporting ” by its employees, and the board agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to urge staff to sign confidentiality confidentiality obligations soon after the allegations aroed was taken by the Managing Director of the YMCA children children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said that was to prevent contamination of evidence, but that has been ‘ zealous ’ and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a a child-organisation organisation in during when Jonathan Lord Lord worked there between 2009 and 2011, explained Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child abuse, told the Commission.
He explained that there had been “ serious problems ” with recruitment, verification, training, training, and supervision of staff.
The hearing has been postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said that he would seize the opportunity to return as the British prime minister – but concmits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening to orate the fifth anniversary of his leaving office, the 59-year-old year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resigndown in June 2007 after a decade as world leader, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British policy, and has limited his comments mostly to foreign policy and and his role as the Quartet of the Quartet of peacekeakers in the Middle East.
When asked whether he would like to return to ierminister, Blair was quoted by the venvenStandard Standard in London saying “ Yes sure, but it is unlikely to happen, so so... ”
When the se-se-w experts arrived in droves in Cardiff to cut the horse of the year, they knew that tough competition was minent.

The crun, who is not even the kindergarten and took its first steps only a few months ago and his Shetlandpony tee ee tarelaxed through through the laps aps and took first first – – leaving leaving behind 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable couple, both in size, were praised for their appearance, conduct, and style in the annual competition competition staged by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he set his his fs s in a naughty angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by judges for his natural skills in dealing with the pony far above his age.
And Tee ee was top marks for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee present as last March for his third birthday and has been practicShShetpony ony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “ Fenton and Toffee are a great team. ”
They had to compete against the the field and left off field with gold poal and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all delighted when he won.
Absolely foreigners in the arena thought him as so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Evan Vale, South Wales, follows in footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than a years.
Howells said, “ The whole audience was how electrielectrized, and everyone fired and clated him. ”
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes takes care of.
As it has off, it will not be long before he is on the Horse of the Year show – and I am sure it will do well.
One spokesman for the annual horse show said, “ Fenton is only three, but he knows to deal with his pony. ”
Together they are a great team.
The jury judges rated Fenton and Toffee on how well they had have done and presented in the demonstration ring.
They look a good cooperation between Pony and the guide – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fentons sweet clothes has done her part to really really perfectly to the occasion.

According to lexology, veganism subject to vegetarianism, but it differs in a considerable way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream etcream, ice or a vigorty egdam, these gourmet ghts not not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to giving ing meat and fish, the vegan relounses all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, might wonder, but on closer closer, the van world of nutrition is characterised by a considerable ingenuity.
" Brespreads are very popular, " " explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of local rehealth house, who has a wide variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also gladly visiting the shop in the Domgasse.
Born New Zealanders has he vegan for 13 years, and in Lampertheim he finds almost) everything he needs to live. " 1997 I converted my diet and a vegetarian ".
At the turn of the century the next step was and I became a vegan.
" The conviction was not only due to nutrition but also to the choice of shoes, " says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather over normal leather.
He realised that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, vegan is an ethics.
" I don't want animals to die for for me, " Proctor argues the motto of vegans, which covers all consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning burbur,, agagitating eggs or rubber rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered some completely new products and the enthusiasm soared.
" It is a double bonus, " ProcProcsays today, " in fact vegis not a sacrificup nor asce, it is an enrichment.
And these same conditions that to fail some, however well-intentioned attempts.
" The addiction factor is a very crucial factor, which makes many give up quickly, similar as with smoking, " Proctor makes a comparison.
And say:' Certain ours ours not to be tied to the animal'.
Often it is the spices or method of preparation that make the taste.
" You can also produce the same effect in other ways way, " explains explains the vegan.
To a barbecue festival Proctor brings, for example, eggplant, mushrooms and also a few vegsausages.
He looks for a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste taste defty.
Of course you want to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate.
" It should be tasty, but this is not only reduce to animal food ", Proctor said.
Health damage up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption assumption, he had not suffered.
For me, the geover had a positive aspect.
I do not take any foreign cholesterol and I am a an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed themselves only vegan.
" My blood values are excellent, I get often checked times, " Proctor tells ys.
In particular, the lack of vitamin B12 has many critics of vegansim.
'Since animals are fed with feed rather instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the freech, the vitamin amin 12 12 is high', Proctor finds.
Vegegans also have the option to take the coenzyme as tablets.
" My B12 values are fine, " he explains.
Proctor does not have to go a long way to obtain food.
After all, there are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket has now has soya milk and other products.
I can find everything that I need on the spot.
Only from time to time I buy something special.
" Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but that is also the known case for " ordinary " finished products too..
In any case, preparation vegegan dishes is much more expensive and less time-consuming is commonly thought.
" There is a lot to discover in the in-house kitchen, with a small tocks you can achieve good good, if not partially better results, " says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, slightly more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cakes, Proctor could also help astoze his faparents in law.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new touch of flavoning.
This has dynamism if you cotogether together it has a new value.
" The situations that can arise are as different as people themselves, " Proctor says.
Of course, however, has has met with scepticism.
Do you not enjoy my food?
" Am I have to feel bad now because I drink milk? " - on such kinds kinds of question, you have to be sensitive as a vegan.
" I do not reject the people, I am a part of this society, " Proctor does not want to freean enclaviva.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as alien to vegas suspected and does the vegan not as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
It is also possible to fast food.
You can fries in the place!
" Many dönshops are offering falafel, or a vegetarian yufka, " says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he switts pastpasta, or orders a a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants set themselves so slowly on it.
" When I started feeding me vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult, " the New Zeanders anders can out a development: " You have talk talk the people, to make this aware to it ".
" If enough demands are,, they may be inclined to complement the menu, " he hopes.
Vegan restaurants evolve, such as the bus stands in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor hopes that other restaurants should also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
" Meat, on contrast, are exclusive, literally the word, because they exclude others, " " Proctor notes.
" If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible from the outset, " Proctor said.
Buasing vegan products could be a bit difficult to start with.
Especially when you learns to understand that can also animal animal additives as colouring or in peanuts, you follows the ethics seems to be the courage courage courage courage in so many hurmany obstacles and traps.
This is not why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: " Veganisissimo AniAnimal ingredients and Alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are with dients and detergents.
" Gradually you develop a scanner view and know which signs and logos to pay attention of " It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stand still or stumble, " Proctor knows.
Veganism, an important a moral finger that beumps on consciousness.
He may not not quite manage to discone's habits, but at least he can teach consumers to take criquestions at their habits.

Foreign Real TaTax sus London ’ s Spulative Bble
The Treasury has visionvisioncalculated the CGT measure, but is awaiting the final decision by Chancellor of ExequequGeorge borne borne who had imposed a 7% ststamp tax on homes in the 2012 budget that cost more than £2 million, as well as as annual fees for purchasyers who hold corporate homes, not individuals.
Already, revenue from the property stamp tax in the Westminster and Kensensington Chelsea districts, which were £708 million in the 2012-13 tax tax year, exceed proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales Scotland, the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire, and combined Humber region.

Scientists could shed more light on the connection between a dog ’ s swwan ring is to its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wiled the tail more to right (from the dog's viewpoint), while nervous dogs were to the left side.
But now scientists are saying that other dogs can eive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientiat the University of Trento, said: “ It is well known that the left left right-right hhus of the brain react differently to stimuli that create positive or negative emotions. ”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs and in humans, the right brain hemisphere are responsible for movement on the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemisphes played different roles in feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to their fellow ons ’ sideal of their wan movement, the researchers watvised animals while watching films films from other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged legs and analysed the behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the tail moves moving in one direction, in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: ‘ We showed dogs to films with dogs – either a true natural version or a silhouette order to eliminate distracting other aspects and we have been able to control the movement of the tail to the left or the right ’.
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive pressive dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wating dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclt mainly to left (again again from the perspective of the dog that wging)), their heart rate increased and they looked resteasy.
To Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate through these movements.
Rather, he believes that the dogs would have learned from experience in which movements they should worry about when should not.
He said, ‘ If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wedging connected to the tail in one direction rather to friendly behavior, and if the right side more rather a less friendly behavior, you on the basis of that experiences. ”
Researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainaches to better understand their animal ’ s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behaviour and guest fellow at the Faculof Animal Mediccs at University of Bristol, explained that this was not the first study to aswhether whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn heads to to left when they look at aggressive aggressive dog and to to right right if it is a satisfied dog.
In another research at Victoria University of Canada, the said, “ dogs tend closer to a robotic s dog if being, his tail ” wg the left than the right rather than becoming restettless – exactly the other way around than in the Italian study. ”
According to him, the differences could come from because the dogs in different studies did interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halemisphbrain brain are used for different purposes, many of of the details have yet to be determined – and dogs are not no exception, ” says Bradshaw said.
But, since their behavior can be be recorded, probably probably not not take long before we understand why sometimes the tail sometimes moving in the one direction, sometimes in the other.

Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals is likely to have fallen by February.
He declared that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary to allow the number of cardinals to reto 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he likes.
The consistency ’ next year is important because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment there is some overhang on the part of Europe and particularly Italy.
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance, ” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to call since the formation of the Council of Cardinals als established by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, charged with finding ways of reforming the Church.

However, we have not been in this position – it is all completely new.
Valero said that the bishops from large places are typically called to be Cardinals, but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we do not know who he appoints. ”

Desate cry from Obama Obama voters
I twice twice elected President Obama to hoping that change could possible.
He says that Obama has made commendeable efforts thwared by RepublicRepublican blockade tactics.
Blockade ade doesn not excexcuse Obamacare's website problems, the drone attacks
Obama ’ s memoirs of the 2008 campaign campaign be a sad reminder of what could have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I thought would would brighten ten up up during the deceptive second year of my medical studies and give me me hope.
It is called “ The Audacity to Win, descridescribes Barack Obama s memoirs for the presidential election in 2008.
When I finish with my patient records at night and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politicians could inspire millions and take the breath from a speech.
The election became a landslide victory, and news outers to demonstrate the historical importance of this hour.
My classmates wept for joy, and parents parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was en way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awawakening as if you be taken out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague reminmemory, a sad reminder der of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first voted in favour, something has indeed changed.
But it is not nothing I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and multifaceted Obama Obama achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end to to the forced concealment of homosexuality, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I agree that partpartipolitical blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts aimed to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But, having having defended the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintintances I have have the end of trying to explain explanations.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign leaders of state allowed be interintercepcepted or the killing of innocent children by overseas drones.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the ’ lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished for dispreport state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American American citizen, was murdered without a trial, nor why the public funding and spending barriers are bypvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report that states that the White House ’ s efforts to cclle le on the media have been the the most aggressive … … since the Nixon government. ”
And recently, it cannot not excuse the inability to design a simple website site in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know whether that is what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at at 18 that the government work could contradict the political campaigns that was before it.
Obviously, the Members' office is not a predictable course forward, as an opposition party and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, characterise public debate.
But when I look at the examples given above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me most.
I elected Obama back in 2012, not because I was liked about candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unthoued-out alternative; he seemed seemed able to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from pressure from future elections, would fulfil the hope that we had heard about for so long.
But, with Obama ’ s approval ratings dropped to below 45% this week, this book has made the return the 2008 all the harder.
It awouses ens longing for the many promises that have gone evaporporate.
This week, I read a section in the book on how Obama suffered a heavy loss against Clinton in the primaries in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election workers following the decision, he told told his staff that they must get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
“ I want us to find our magic ms again, ” he said.
We must remember who we are.
They are five years later, Mr President, and I could not agree with you any more.

Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are cooperating with authorities in investiginvestigations in the world ’ s largest financial market, where they owners US 5.3 trilli3 trilliday a day.
The two traders would be the first RBS staff suspended in the expanding investigation investigation sulied by the Libor interbank scandal.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspension, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from the authorities.
“ Our investigation on this issue is continuing and we cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators, ” the Bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, individuals close to the situation reported that the RBS had ded the records of emails and instant messages sent from and a previous trader, to the British regulatory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.

News about these research has roiled traders in an area that has been one of the the most profitable of trading units of investment banks in recent years years but but has been under pressure this year because low low currency volatility limits the chances of speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasing use of banks ’ s own internal platforms means that “ it is possible to influence the market with with very low ticket prices. ”
The news came on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it had terminated a trader of its London Exchange Traded fund offices this week after causing a loss of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly briefed the competent authorities and cooperates with them.
“ We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter has been contained, ” said Credit Suisse.

Dr. Georges Bwelle Brves free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost almost every weekend to treating hundreds of patients.
In West African country there ’ not have many doctors, only one for 5,000 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top ten “ CNN Heroes of 2013 ”.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him the “ CNN Hero of the Year ”.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his exceptional work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father losing consciousness time and over again and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was wounded in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only a broken arm, but then was an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused caused a hematome that would hpair him for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, ” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken it from Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years escting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals als get the treatment they had to offer.
“ It ’ not easy easy ” commcommented Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o the morning and run to the hospital to be the first and you are not first.
There are very many patients.
Some people are even dying of having to wait.
The situation has scarcely changed since Bwell ’ s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is one doctor for every 5 000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
On the other hand, United States, the ratio is a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for her, most Camerodes could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country ’ s health spending are private.
“ The only problem they have is poverty, ” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his compatriots suffering to see Bwelle welle decide to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 operations free of charge last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organisation called ASCOVIME, which which travels at weekends in the rural areas and provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped close to 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he, and up to 30 people forced themselves on minibuses and travel with snowsnowed medical equipment on the roof, unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
It does not always go smoothly smoothly.
Already more than once they have had to push vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are received like heroes: a feast, singing and dance and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and rede – with its broad smile and limitless energy – is like to attend the cheerful celebration.
The next morning, the team starts the examination of hundreds of patients.
“ Per journey we treat 500 500 people,, says Bwelle.
You come from a 60 km radius around the village – and on foot.
Each of these clinhospitals offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malmalnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document is needed for the school but but that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening the team team performs simple operations with local surgery.
The operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; the patients rise up the surgery and go to the relaxation area to make room for the next bour.
The lighting for the operation and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group of the group and so will work Bwelle and his volunteers up into the early hours on Sunday.
It is a tiring job, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“ They drum drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work, ” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then returns to the city, being tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has conducted 700 surgeries last year, knows that that its work work to make a huge difference to the people it helps.
One man explained that the free breast-surgery operation he had received now allows him to rework.
“ This is changing the future of my family, ” the man said.
In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, welle also also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he is financing 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle, while the rest deriderived from private donations.
“ I really do not know when he is sleeping, ” says atie O ’ Malley ley who studied for the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine and participates voluntarily in Bwell ’ s group.
He is always either in hospital, or trying to raise money for the organization for order to go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwave, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
" We can be involved in operations where we help to triin in blood or to keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle, " explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring often donated ated itation material.
However once once you are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and the instructions.
" He is, no doubt a hero, " says O'Malley.
He dedicvotes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the people of Cameroon knows no limits.
For wave, the almost permanent work is not a burden.
Helping others to live happhappier and fulfilling fulfilling a promise he gave his father gives him great pleasure.
“ I am so happy when I do this work, ” says Bwelle.
And I have thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I am doing.
I do it to make people laugh and to relieve the pain.

About 157 metres the two towers towers werate into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who admirat the two filigree church towers, suspect that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the Cologne underunderworld.
Meeting point for his guided tours is the Service Center of Cologne directly at the cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacular: " We are starting in the underground garage ", says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city's fathers wanted a city suitable suited the cars, and therefore, of the remains of the old city wall only remained remained that was not not too big.
Most users of the multi-storey car park therefore rush past the Roman remains and just park off their car.

There are ruins ruins about five metres high height of handcellar sized stones.
" They are the remains of the Roman city walls, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ ", says Schulze.
Before it back to daylight again, Schulze lets the participants on upper park level cast a gllook into a dark shaft metre deep.
This is the fountain of the Old Cathedral, which is unfortunately also hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the pretorium, and participants are descdown down again.

And the pretorium is the former manate Palace the centre of power of the Roman empire on the Rhine.
From the entrance hall of the exhibition a tunnel leads access to the Roman sewage, which is preserved here about 120 metres in length.
" You can easily walk a a along along the so-called Cloaca MaximMaxima, if you like ", Schulze encourages the guests.
Schulze still comes one a surprise.
After getting the key at the cashier, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep walkable shaft.
" We are now in the kwe, a ritJewish bath, " he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep deep into ground to to the the water that was essential essential for ritual washes.
To date, in the lower end of the Miwe we, whose date date to to eighth century, different water levels can can be seen by varying lower levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe becomes become of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work is to begin shortly.

It had apparently preceded by a chase with several cars.
The indictment was about turf fighting and a demonstration of power.

The Disable Society Does Not ink
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood good, but eventually it goes home.
However, hunger hunger making noticeable in people's bellies on the front-passenger and back seat.
Of course, this may be caused of some cocktail or champagne!
What is more obvious than chiled to the next drive-in to treat yourself something a yourself?
I admit that I would happy to join part when it comes to fast food food at midnight or early the morning.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then no like back home and back the bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and hungry disco gosingers become apparent.
For what can you miss in if you constantly throwing your fastfast food bags from the car window?!
Especially at the weekends there are discarded paper paper bags on street edges and in parking parks.
'Why wonder'.
Are the people too much to take the bags home with or up to the next dustbin?
It is not just the case that paper paper spocks the landscape.
Packts have also already hidden covered transport such as guard barriers barriers and have led gered accidents.
Ththinks about what said " disposable able society " but not reflection, presumably it does not even know what this word actually means.
If you travel more often in night, especially with several people in the car, you know what a rear seat seat after reated nights can can look like: clothes, bottles and other rubbish are pilpped up.
A few bags would not would not make a significant of difference - in contrast to the road, where no one wants to trample on the food's remains of others.
I already see the day coming when the towns and communities are silid to their way - and the fast food chains have have to demand deposits for their bags.
