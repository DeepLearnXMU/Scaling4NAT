Gutach ’ s Even Greater Safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 metres apart: on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian light at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older town hall lights.
Two installations so close together: intention or toreld?
Gutach mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
" The town hall lights were installed back then because they secure the way to school, " explained Eckyesterday.
The traffic lights are safe cyclists and bus passengers and mountain inhabitants.
The plant officially put into operation yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have a museum, two churches, a spa park, a bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ‘ Grub ’.
" Another traffic light had had to be created for safety with the high volume of traffic and pedestrians, " says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg Regional Council Office.
" According to current measurements, around 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B 33, of which about 10% are heavy goods traffic, " stresses Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: " Safety is first here, " says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows have been carried out, a roundabout was also contemplated, but discarded because of the narrowness in the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße intersection area.
According to Arnold, everything was previously tested when choosing the location of the traffic lights: " We have tested by means of a transporter loaded with particularly long trunks for us whether these vehicles could leave from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without bending the the traffic poles ".
The traffic lights, which costs around EUR 15 000 itself, is the " the most modern thing on the market today, " explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so vigorously that the lights can be seen by the drivers, for example, even in the low sun.
And it is also economical: the older light systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones consume only eight watts.
There are three light systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian press the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, comes immediately green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor examines whether the pedestrian start-up phase can be completed.
" If a group or people with disabilities cross the road, the start-up period will be extended, so everyone will take the road safely, " explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver would have to think about this as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: as soon did the traffic lights turn green for pedestrians, an upper class vehicle rushing through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and adolescence from his soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - speechlessness, the tendency towards brute violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - have been described by the Carinthian poet on many occasions.
The winner of the Büchner Prize is well known primarily as a prose author, and theatre texts are scarce in his work.
Collage from prose texts Gerhard Fresacher therefore compiles a collage of prose texts for his performance " Weather Luminaires on the Tongue Peak ", which can now be seen in garage X on St. Peter's Square.
The theatre maker, for example, combines elements from the autobiographical novel " Der Leibeigene " (1987) with prosampling from " Leichnam, Cavening seine Family " (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important props: a cracked sofa on which hints of copying and masturbating - the eight-member ensemble winds through the textual material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance covers the original with a wealth of directing, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms.
Especially the actresses are involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are hard, immersed under water with their heads, packed on the wall with their evening robes.
Forced into cellophane or bother, they stroke on dangerously high stickths through the production, either monologize them loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text scarcely communicates in this strenuous way.
The best moments in the evening are when you are singing - from Deep Purple to popular songs.
It is only towards the end that the twisted performance calm down somewhat, and Winkler ’ s almost absurd humor flashes.
A black box in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decating Highway system and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can fit on the dashboard of every car.
The equipment that records every kilometer travelled and reporting the information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and advocate that the government should be able to use the small boxes to record the kilometres travelled – and possibly also where they were travelled – and then use the information to calculate tax decreures.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The US Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But, while Congress cannot agree on one course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently considering how, over the next ten years, they can switch to a system where drivers pay per mile they elled.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This really is a must for our country.
“ It ’ s nothing we ’ ll use, ” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of the Southern California assessment of Governments, who plans to record the miles leelled with all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 onwards.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there for that.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed by the taxes paid by Americans at the fuel pump, is bankrupt.
But there is no longer as much refuelling up in America as there used to be.
Cars consume less petrol.
The government tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians dare not raise the tax by one cent at high fuel prices.
“ The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable, ” says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mileage payment system.
“ This is the most sensible long-term alternative, ” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mileage based user charge.
Not surprisingly, the idea appeals to urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging emissions.
California ’ s planners rely on the system to devise strategies to achieve the state ’ s ambitious, legal goals on climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he sees this as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Reason Foundation ’ s freelance marketers also support the idea of making drivers pay after the distance travelled.
“ This ’ s not a tax that disappears in a black hole, ” explains Adrian Moore, Reason ’ s Vice President of Guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, called on Congress to move toward mileage accounting.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project involving 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or the city in their everyday lives.
Nevertheless, several states and large cities are moving in this direction on their own.
Oregon, currently recruiting 5,000 drivers to the country ’ s largest experiment, is most committed.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the tax to the state.
Nevada has completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering such a thing as well.
Illinois tests it with lorries.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 east coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with equipment, motorists were skeptical that the government could pursue any of their movements.
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem, ” explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Rescome Management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People did not want.
When the test started, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: “ It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into fully-fledged monitoring devices. ”
There is no need to build a gigantic, obky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology to enable the state to capture the kilometers travelled, but not exactly when and where.
That, Khan argues, would also reassure public opinion.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not originally stand to help states tax drivers.
Rather, its aim was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for motor insurance, with drivers paying on the basis of miles spent.
However, the equipment it tests is also of interest to road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information, which is uploaded regularly via modem.
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded, ” said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a variety of choices.
You can choose with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any appliance at all and instead pay a flat rate based on the average miles travelled by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other bodies hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing devices with more functions than less.
In New York City, transport officials want to develop a tax device that can also pay for parking fees, pay insurance only for kilometers travelled, and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time that will allow drivers to avoid congestion.
“ Drivers are motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system, ” says a city ’ s planning document.
Some transport planners, however, wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials declared that Congress could solve the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they, too, pay a fair share.
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient, ” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission ’ s head of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld ’ s Small Team
Despite a lack of staff, the Voluntary Fire Brigade passed its first test with flying colours.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Departmental commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate at Burgberger Straße in his assumption of practice.
A short circuit is said to have been created there during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoking development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After Hans Kammerer ’ s first review of the situation, two breathing carriers of the defence agreed to enter the building.
After a short period of time we managed to find the first person and lead it.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy because a narrow staircase could be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw balls inside.
There were also woodworking machines.
The first extinguishing attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via an overfloor hydrant at about 100 metres away.
Three deletion attacks have been designed.
A hollow tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also about showing what can be done with few staff available.
In case of an emergency, support is provided via the Königsfeld daily group.
The commander was satisfied with the exercise proceeding.
Networking of universities and companies
During his visit to the Breisg-HochBlack Forest district, President Guido Wolf also received information in Titisee-Neustadt as to where tomorrow's workers come from.
In the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, he studied this important issue together with the heads of the vocational schools, the district gymnasium and the chairmen of Parental Advisory Board.
" Education is an important location factor, " stressed Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans-Thoma School, presenting the networked school project The High Black Forest Education Centre.
Wolf was impressed by the training model projects.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and Berufsschulzentrum in the Wälderstadt.
He also praised the family of the county.
" It is important to look not only at the family phase, but also at the phase of caring for caring for family ones due to demographic change, " Wolf explained.
He also said that an increasing number of employees took care of caring and caring for their loved ones.
" Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an termination of the employment relationship, " Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose skilled workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
" Those who have already come to know the benefits of the region during their studies are often preserved the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills, which helps to strengthen the region, " the President of the regional parliament was convinced.
Only if sufficient training places were offered will it be possible to meet the needs of skilled workers.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the south-west of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
On his railway journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to develop local public transport.
'Persevere and ensure public transport improves,' he explained to the local politicians present.
An entertaining afternoon with Music
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors for coffee, cakes and then a Vesper.
In the past, the elderly were served in the rest.
In the meantime this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salads.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmir entertained with common melodies.
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall, which the front delimitation of the old school yard, which is underbeing renovated to the Kirchstraße, is once again be included in the rehabilitation plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days leading up to the kilbig, a small angle wall was installed during the first work on the renovation of the front school yard to stabilize and static relieve the more than one hundred year old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunling Municipal Building Office, the further procedure is to involve the National Monument Office in the plans and to draw up a rehabilitation concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation is then to be carried out by experts, which will then be put on the table to the local council to decide and determine how to proceed.
A decision on this is expected to be taken as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree-planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the boundary wall in need of renovation will have to be completely renovated and placed on a new structure in the foreseeable future as a consequence.
The historical, hundred-year-old delimary wall of the old school yard to the Kirchstraße is in need of repaired, and has an arc tendency forward, mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not at danger of collapse at the moment.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a school yard used by pupils, which has been done by the current fortification work.
Originally, the school refurbishment was even planned in 2008 / 2009, but high unplanned spending resulted in a postponement.
The National Monument Office will have an important say in the historic renovation of the school wall, which has even been used for filming.
If specifications come from this side, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the protectors of monuments.
Students of the Bräunlinger elary school, who are now taught again in a well renovated old school building with a new auditorium, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now entered the ongoing discussions on the future of the music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
" I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart, " said Özdemir " Stuttgarter Nachrichten ".
Jazz and classical music go hand in hand at the jazz location Stuttgart.
In so doing, Özdemir, who is regarded in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate in the federal elections on 22 September, contradicts the Green Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this accelerates a reorganisation of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
The programme in jazz and pop will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim, among other things.
US Border: " Super Tunnel " for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the US, investigators have discovered and closed a' super tunnel' for drug smuggling.
According to US customs authorities, the more than 500 metre pipe between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railways, and an ventilation system.
Three suspects have therefore been arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
According to the tunnel had not yet been used.
" These cartels are stupid when they think they can dig under the radar, " said Laura Duffy, Attorney General of Southern California, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego where an end of the tunnel had been discovered.
To the drug gangs, said Duffy: " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of dirty money ".
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in ongoing fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug-related crime.
Constructed by Experts
Due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 metres into the depths to the actual entrance to the tunnel.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres in height and 90 centimetres in width.
It would have been able to encourage illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine finding.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three face the maximum sentence for life imprisonment, as officials have said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, the press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction.
Normally cocaine is smuggled in small quantities, not through tunnels.
This demonstrates the " desperpair " of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug search DEA in San Diego.
They would do everything in their power to get to the United States.
No details have been given of the detainees, and at least one is Mexicans, they said.
They face prison sentences of up to ten years.
Geisinger ’ s Festival Year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Return of the first written mention is approaching.
When the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks' time, the anniversary year is approaching.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned in 794.
A document has been produced in churches in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there is to be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen does not currently have a hall, this event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
Several events are planned during the anniversary in Geisingen as well as in church houses.
Church Hausen in July on a festival weekend from 18 to 20 July the 1250.
Celebrate.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church hall.
On this festival weekend there is also the Kirchen-Haus Church Festival.
On the occasion of its anniversary, the City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a composition for the city, which will be performed on three dates.
On June 21 together with the sunlion celebration of the Black Forest Association, on July 12th in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13th as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
It will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is the last weekend of September, 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger ’ s anniversary, a new chronicle will also be released.
" But it should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but also a printed work about the spiritual singing of today, which consists precisely of violsinging, church houses, boddingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen, " says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
Today ’ s Geisingen also celebrates its birthday in 2014, and in 1974 the present ’ s space was completed with the communals.
The new chronicle will be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year of anniversaries.
The Straw glonki fool guild starts on February February with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the harmony of Gutmadingen is 90 years old and has the banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1st to 4th May.
The old work of Leipferdingen is 40 years old, Geisinger School has been at its new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this during the Well festival from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in documents in 764 in a gift certificate owned by St. Gallen Monastery.
The certificate was produced in churches (houses), which was then a court.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
It was the reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly, and it was also 40 years since local reform.
Targeting rail installations
Is the railway crossing' Am Hirschen' railway crossing is to be extensively rebuilt in order to increase road safety?
Yes, local councils have decided.
Schiltach must take EUR 220 000 into this purpose.
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety at railway crossings should be increased - trains collide with other vehicles on a regular basis.
If the municipalities agree to the restructuring measures, they will have to share one-third of the costs, while the rest will be shared by the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's master builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the Bahcrossing " Am Hirschen ".
There, the city plans to build a coving near the tunnel to the west of the railway tracks.
There, larger vehicles, such as those transporting lumber, could stand in return without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed that a necessary support wall be constructed in such a way that the city could widen the road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversial in in local council as some councils questioned the need for road proliferation: Thomas Thomas Kipp summed up the mood of the critics:' Do we have to take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?'
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: the railway crossing " Hirschen " is used regularly for long-ghwood transport.
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is partly transported across this route, because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Häberles bridge, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, Haas argued that the route would serve as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel if the main road is closed.
Since it is clear that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels will have to be converted and reconstructed, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the' Am Hirschen' railway crossing could have an important significance for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to have an investigation into the costs of the proposed road widening.
Despite this, a majority agreed to the reconstruction of the railway crossing on the proviso that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road in the direction of " Bahnhofstraße " if necessary to around 5.5 metres for meeting traffic.
The reconstruction of the railway crossing at Trautwein Gerberei, on the other hand, could lead to a completely different problem concerning access to the rapidly increasing' Geroltzhäuser Weg'.
The administration had had the Breinlinger engineering office examine the conversion plans of the railway, as it doubted as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser weg was still easily possible.
The study concluded that it cannot be ruled out that the inclination of the road could lead to longer vehicles lying.
Responsibility for this, in turn lies with the city as road carrier.
Restructuring could therefore lead to disputes of liability.
, Haas argued, because both wood deforestation and turning worked in their current state of construction, the reconstruction of the railway crossing should Habe agreed.
Also, the risk of the train colliding with a vehicle in transit is also much lower than at the other railway crossings, because there is right next to it is the centre stop to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main train station should have been slowed down at this point that there is no risk of collision.
According to the Councils were not refused to approve the reconstruction of this railway crossing, as the city of Schiltach would have to " pay " for the problem of lying vehicles, since the railways would be able to withdraw from responsibility once the construction work had been completed.
The body considers no problem with the conversions at the vor Heubach and Kuhbach railway crossings, for which agreements have already been reached with the rail.
Esa chooses major space missions: Missions for billions
Far planets, waves of gravity or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they intend to launch in the coming years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the race.
Worlds.
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
No one knows whether there are lives in at least some of them.
The choice is difficult: should look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for earth-like planets and thus perhaps discover extra-terrestrial life?
These are the very questions responsible for the European Space Agency, Esa, are asking.
For their Cosmic Vision programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects, which are intended to make decisive progress in research.
The budget for such' L missions' each is around EUR 1 billion.
The launch is expected to take place in 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were up for discussion, five of them have now been shortlisted.
Many bodies are examining the proposals and hasing researchers.
A final decision is due to be taken by the scientific programme committee in the next few days.
The Esa has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme, launched in 2007, should find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and lives?
The exact processes of forming stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star owns planets, under what circumstances can life be created there?
To investigate this question, the Cheops space telescope is to be launched in 2017, which will examine more closely at 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity.
The possibilities are limited, however, and cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map earth-like planets, even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, searching for " biomarkers ": gases deemed to indicate biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately intended to shed light on the conditions for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field, as well as the particle radiation it emits with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined as an example.
With the Solar Orbiter, Esa has already approved an M class mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe should start in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa provides for the first of the three L missions of the " Cosmic Vision " program.
The probe " Juice " (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reached Jupiter to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
Space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to check whether the laws of nature with which we know are still valid there.
There may also be discrepancies that could physicists in the way to a new theory under which umbrella of all known laws of nature can be combined.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos arose by the big bang.
In addition to the matter we know, that makes up stars, planets, and living beings like us, there are dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy that accelerates the expansion of outer space.
So far, researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fraction of a second of the Big bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With " Euclid ", the Esa has already approved an M mission, which is scheduled to be launched in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who Could the Race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
In the opinion of many experts, the best chances of approval as an L-mission have " E-Lisa ", an ambitious concept for detecting gravitational waves.
This means physicists changes in the structure of spacestime that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proved to date.
Elisa could do that, scientists behind the project hope.
The mission provided with a detector consisting of two or three probes stationed in space.
Unlike facilities on Earth, it could also demonstrate gravitational waves created during the Big bang, providing new insights into the emergence of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " which will explore black holes, " Icy Planets, " another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, " Prism, " a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and Exoplanet Finder to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
Progposals for the return transport of samples from Mars, for research into the moon, venus and asteroids, as well as solar physics have already been dropped.
Snowden “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance.
Edward Snowden, the whistlelower of the US intelligence service, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander, do not provide answers about their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden presented to the media in Berlin by Ströbele wrote, he wrote, “ Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissent as a fialty and trying to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment where no defense is possible. ”
But telling is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the international community support could persuade the US government to drop the charge against him.
The indictment brought by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Interior Minister, Hans-Peter Friedrich, told Zeit Online: ‘ If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make that possible ’ ”
US-German relations are burdened by claims that the NSA has intercepted German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who chairs the parliamentary intelligence committee, said that one should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if possible, “ without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US. ”
Ströbele, a Green member, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
Two German journalists accompanied him during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to former NSA employee Snowden ’ s lawyer cannot return to Russia when he leaves the country.
When Snowden testifies in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is “ safe, ” the MP says.
Snowden explains in his letter that he faces a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that has driven him from his homeland.
But it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression. ”
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a credit to the general public.

Frontier Airlines charges hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 from passengers wishing to store hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for one piece of hand baggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, although Wednesday's announcement stated that passengers were allowed to keep the can.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat small bags under the seat are free of charge.
Frontier declared that it is charged USD 25 if the fee is paid in advance and USD 100 for passengers who only paid at the boarding.
Front spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee is aimed at getting travellers to take care of payment in advance.
“ We don ’ t want to calculate this sum, ” she explained.
In 2008, airlines began to charge charges for the first and second pieces of checked baggage.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore filled as much as possible in their hand baggage, with the result that the luggage above the seat are often overcrowded.
Charges are one way of getting passengers take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money.
These are Frontier ’ s most loyal customers, who would have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers buying their tickets from the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may take one piece of baggage free of charge at the Frontier boarding gate, but the next person may have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of baggage.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier website and check-in procedures are be changed so that passengers are aware of the fee before they reach the boarding.
Frontier's new hand baggage charge will only enter into force in the summer and there is no exact date.
Passengers often complain about luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that transporting baggage should cost money and passengers should pay for the service if they so wish.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them, however, have left their fingers of hand baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge hand baggage three years ago, and later Allegitimant Air, also a low-cost airline, followed.
The only other airline with such a charge is Hungarian Wizz Air, says airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit hand baggage charge would bring in USD 50 million a year.
Sorensen, who used to be a leading position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious to know what would expect at the boarding gate if passengers were faced with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage charge.
“ The boarding process was one of the smoothest I have seen in my career in aviation, ” he said.
I expected to see tooth wwashing and tangible discussions at the boarding gate.
“ The plane was full, ” he declared, “ and boarding ran like lubricated. ”
Frontier also follows Spirit on the $2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company declared that passengers buying a lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and be refilled coffee free of charge.
Water remains free of charge.
US Airways had briefly tried to ask for money for soft drinks in 2008, but seven months later reversed this after passengers complained and no other large company had followed suit.
Frontiers step to charge for hand baggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agents such as Orbitz for US $10 to US $25 per ticket sold.
This provides all companies with an incentive to buy directly from them, rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to allocating only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday were reduced to another 25% of the route.
As a result, a journey with frontier of more than 1000 miles booked with a third party provider will earn customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when purchasing directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenues fell by 9% and flight capacity contracank just under 13% in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to control with Frontier Frontier ’ s finances in selling society.
Proverbials Coming from the Bible
More than 40 women visited the last women's breakfast of this year in the Protestant parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish house was " proverbials from the Bible " and " phrases from the Middle Ages ".
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, Chairman of the Church Council, addressed the biblical proverbials in a lecture.
" Proverbials contain life wisdom, regulations or warnings, " she explained.
She compared several proverbials with the respective Bible and explained their meaning.
She called proverbials like: wooden eye be vigilant, as scales fall from the eyes, keep an eye on someone who gives to whom His Lord in sleep, wash his hands of it.
On several occasions, the speaker also advised her listeners what the proverb it was.
The phrases of the Middle Ages were taken up by the parish Christel Dehner: all good things are three, making blue, somewhat hidden.
She explained the meaning and origin of what she called' bridges into the past'.
Finally, a raffle was raffled.
The prizes were covered on a table and humorously before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round also mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for the unskilled tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is being launched at the Mecklenburg Seenplatte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled in the sector are to be qualified as professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
" What ’ s new is that the six-month courses end with qualifications, " said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are manifold: they would not make the participants unemployed, it would give companies with trained professionals, who were increasingly absent from hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
NSA declares that an “ internal error, ” not hackers, are to blame for the site ’ s crash.
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late on Friday that a bug had paralysed its public website for a few hours, not hackers, as was claimed online.
“ NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update, ” explained the espionage agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening hours online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and that some users still is not.
Previously, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network had not been compromised “ in any way. ”
Secret information is not in danger, according to the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to paralyze the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website will be flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics is relatively simple, and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the target system ’ s internal network.
Formerly the super-secret NSA, once nickcalled No Such Agency (No such Agency), is now in the public light and is severely criticized after the revelations in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of targeted operation.
In October, the number of people without jobs fell slightly slightly by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate was at 3.1% better than last year and also better than in September, " we would have hoped for more, " says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Agency for Employment in Sonthofen.
So far, many companies have reacted cautiously when it comes to hiring.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: " We have hardly any professionals in the crafts, health care and care for the elderly ".
Due to the season, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been added since September.
The winter season starts there in mid-December.
The entire background report can be found in the Allgäu display sheet of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Bombardier loss of profits after delivery numbers and orders
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% decrease in net profit after coming under pressure from falling orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway sector.
The Montreal based Bombardier also did not publish flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could be used commercially next September in accordance with the ambitious timetable.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago has so far been followed by only three more take-off, which raises doubts as to whether the test phase is proceeding as planned.
Results fell short of forecasts and led to more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, Cameron dose, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating of “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” so that shares have limited price potential over the next one or two quarters.
“ Although weaker delivery numbers for aircraft were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the margin trends in the transport sector, ” said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the aircraft test program progresses.
However, if new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment of the market currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and after months of delays, flew for the first time in September.
So far, however, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 have been moderate, as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the company ’ s claims about fuel efficiency and cost-savings potential of the new jet aircraft are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and pledges from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin confident that Bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the jet's commercial use.
On Thursday, the management also assured analysts and the media that the programme was on schedule.
“ The test aircraft no longer on the ground than expected, ” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft ’ s service life.
Each manufacturer.
We have decided to make a first flight and then a revision period, which we have done.
This happens throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, while the remaining shortly afterwards, the company said.
Yet analysts remain skeptical about whether, 12 months after the maiden flight, the first customer can operate a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier explained it will review commissioning planning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“ The slow progress of the flight test – though it obviously corresponds to Bombardian ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015, ” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter, at the end of September 30, Bombardian ’ s net profit fell to $147 million, and 8 cents per share, respectively from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share remains 9 cents.
Sales fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The aerospace order book on September 30 was $32.9 billion, unchanged compared to 31 December.
“ In the aerospace sector, the results were within our targets, but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing, ” said Beaudoin.
The aerospace sales fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have increased by just under 11% to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport sector on September 30 stood at $32.6 billion, slightly up compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems for some major contracts.
According to corporate management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trading on Thursday, Bombardier ’ s share fell by 8.5% to $4.83 Canada, after being announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette would join the Executive Board.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bomber's closest rival, reported a 10% decrease in quarterly profits on Thursday.

Cocaine addict lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigations must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to underworld Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer was afraid that his hidden drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in Liverpool Crown Court.
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction might be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size with Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed “ Bash, ” hailed by “ first-class, ” was arrested in his house in 2011, after the police oversaw Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug case.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a meal in the bar.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They were later arrested, along with 32 others, after the police secured £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and £200,000 in cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, shared information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction might become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, has been convicted and sentenced at the Liverpool Crown Court on two charges of obstructing justice.
He admitted cocaine ownership in a previous survey.
The lawyer was convicted after the police found out in their investigation into Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta ’ s house and put drugs under the lawyer ’ s dustbin with 60% purity in a black golf glove.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at dinner in the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it became known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests found Class A drugs in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied to take cocaine and said that he talked to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that her discussion was subject to “ legal secrecy. ”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During police interrogation, he stated that he was running an office and client, both at his private address and in the workplace, would call him at home for legal matters.
It became known in court that he had called on important players in drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, for significant arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “ A criminal law lawyer should know better than anyone else that you do not break the law. ”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a penal defender because he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficking, but of a drug trafficking who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the advocate of these people.
But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
It counteracted police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed any misconduct, claiming, “ If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to share information with Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, I would do so immediately. ”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: “ Mr Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal the moment he started buying drugs from organized criminals. ”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime, who asked him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation into Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possing cocaine and judicial disability, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals that nobody can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring guilty of conspiracy to trade in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, that his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and that inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160-anniversary anniversary, the wreath of the song Dunningen will frame two services with Franz Schubert's " Deutsche Messe ".
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life ", which enthused spectators in the spring of this year, the wreath will enrich two services at the end of the jubilee year with the performance of Franz Schubert's German Fair.
On Saturday, October 26th, this extraordinary trade fair will be performed during the evening Mass in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. at the service in the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Fair with the original title " Gesänge zur Celebation des Sacred Vicer der Messe ", D 872, is a spiritual music work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The fair will be performed within the framework of religious services, as Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir will be accompanied on the organ by the brass group of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi.
Haslach: Skepticism Increasing Confidence
The 2015 elections to the parish council, for example, will change in the Haslach (SE) ministry unit.
There is then only one common parish council left for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
There is no change in the basic decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them satisfactorily as possible.
Over the day, it became particularly clear that skepticism about the new gives way to reluctantly but gives way to confidence.
From ideas and expectations of 2015 innovations innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the very constructive discussions between the six bodies with the main officials of the pastor team.
Regional dean Georg Schmitt explained the reframed guidelines for ministry units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
After that, the SE Haslach as a church community will henceforth form a public body that into the rights and obligations of the previously six individual church communities.
There will only be one common parish council and one board of trustees on which the parish priest will be represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and in the six parishes are to be made up of so-called community teams.
Their task in the future will be to promote ecclesiastical local life.
The question of the finances of each parish then revealed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations require accumulated funds in the parishes to be earmarked.
Liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the entire community.
There was great concern about the large planned investments, which would then be affected by all parishes.
" In the past, too, investments were made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes on their own, " Haslach's parish chairman, Bruno Prinzbach, relperspective.
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, Chairman of the Board of the pastor Unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They set themselves the task of' becoming one, remaining five' in 2006 and found that it was not at all easy.
The bodies of the Haslach ministry Unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the local teams.
The work will be fleshed out in subsequent meetings and will be decided at another joint meeting of all six fora next spring.
In the end, parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the parish unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
Electricity in Pfullendorf, Electricity is becoming more expensive
Citizens of Pfullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the Managing Director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SUCTKURIER, a family of four Pfullendorfer family incurs an additional cost between 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This levy is set every year in October by the four operators of the large electricity lines.
These quantify the additional costs incurred by them as a result of the reversal of energy, which they can charge through a levy on the price of electricity.
Stadtwerke Pfullendorf are the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
The concrete payments would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke could inform their customers next week of the exact price increase.
" We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x, " says Bias, with the number closer to the 2 cents.
Traffic lights on continuous red: watch out to waiting times
Sometimes traffic light simply does not green.
The contact loop in the street does not react or the light sign is broken.
What should I do then - drive red?
If an affected has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad ".
However, the waiting time must be' appropriate', which can be interpreted differently from one case-by-case basis.
Becker advises you to last at least five minutes before assuming dysfunction in the traffic lights.
However, anyone who continues the journey despite red light light you must be aware that they are fully to blame for an accident that this causes.
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision by the Higher Court of Hamm.
In the case, a driver ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic lights were not broken, but jumped to green shortly afterwards.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not.
The Local Council Budget
Whenever local council meetings are about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well.
The community budget in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not been known to the administration since 2005.
In this respect, the 2012 financial year can also be considered a complete success.
This became clear when the 2012 annual accounts were presented.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was higher than planned, at around EUR 7.6 million over EUR 1 million.
The surplus in the administrative budget, at around EUR 1.8 million, would also be around EUR 1 million higher than the level.
The surplus was mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the local share of income tax.
The wealth budget, too, was well higher than planned.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged, EUR 2.5 million last year.
'This is largely due to the increased allocation from the administrative budget,' Rothmund says.
Since less investment than planned in the 2012 financial year, the reserve supply has also been higher.
It has been possible to increase the general reserve by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
" Such a work cannot simply be shaken out of its sleeve, " Gerster praised with regard to the annual accounts.
He and local councils were obviously pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens dear.
Due to its good financial situation, the municipality was able in the past to do without high rates of leverage.
According to Gerster, however, this, in turn, has often led to cuts in rural subsidies.
There are prerequisites in place for these subsidies from various compensatory sticks.
Amongst other things, the towns and municipalities that apply for grants have to have certain rates of leverage.
" We need to look at the issue of leverage, as in the coming years there are investments for which we would like to see subsidies, " Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermer ’ s story at the male singing association Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herb Festival, during which he was solemnly honoured.
As usual, Hubert Wermter was on stage in the colours of his male singing club.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir probably more than loved.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the club: Jörg Kohr, pastoral lecturer on behalf of the Caescias Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a document from the Association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince.
His colleagues presented him the certificate of the German Choral Association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the award, the 31st Autumn Festival took place on usual tracks: With the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the Baisingen singer department and the local music association, the Vollmaringer had invited a colourful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like " Im Weinparadies " and " fun, her brother ".
For their honorary singer Hubert Wermter they prepared another confession - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's " Bundeslied ".
The male singing association Betra also sang classical choral songs such as " JägerWerbung " by Julius Wengert, " Weit, weit weg " by Hubert Goisern and the folk song " When you will pass through the valley ".
The song wreath Salzstetten, with its mixed choir and women's group - the " impulse choir " - provided the quota for women.
The mixed choir, with the Neapolitan folk styles " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " by Antos Gus, to foreign countries, while the " impulir " also used foreign languages: " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " were part of her programme.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to home with " Was isch der Schwob? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papper's " Bierlied ", where the Vollmaringen Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - " Grandma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperl theatre and read some stories that kept the children busy at noon.

Kenya ’ s Press Disflical Media Law
‘ We are in a frightening situation and one might ask oneself what is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow? ’ read the newspaper that considers the draft law to be unconstitutional.
“ The law is draconian and pishabtive, and we reject it, ” said Cyrus Kamau, Capital Group Managing Director, which includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya ’ s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased, because it is an extension of government, ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy.
‘ I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and return to Parliament, ’ he said.
According to The Star, the new law “ effectively stranglers the media, ” By contrast The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have dealt dealt a severe blow, ” describing the draft “ draconian. ”
The adoption of the law is one of a series of measures to strengthen national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the WestGate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media incited the authorities ’ anger for publishing photographs of security cameras showing how the units posted to the scene allegedly robbing the luxurious shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by hiring two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the invitation was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be punished up to 20 million Kenyan shields and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “ one punishment can bankrupt most radio stations. ”
Moreover, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on Kenya ’ s “ lively blogosphere. ”
If they silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they like with impunity.
“ No one will ever experience, ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation, who describes the Kenyan media as a critical controlling public life.
“ Leaving politicians to their own devices, they lead the country into bankruptcy and lead us back to the days of hunters and collectors, ” he commented.
Kenyan legislators have incited public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts imposed by the National Remuneration Commission and recreated their defective salaries of around 532,000 schillings tax-free per month – among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for the FC
The official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field did not lose its importance for the city and the football club despite the cold weather and the rain.
Everyone would probably have wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to be part.
So all those who came without an umbrella or who, for some reason, could not hold one.
That was the case for the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as to some of the speakers.
That is why FC Chairman, Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of fulfilling a dream, became wet.
First of all, his thanks went to mayor Walter Klumpp, who made a strong commitment to the implementation of the project, to the local council, the companies involved and members of the association who took part.
Lothar Hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
Horged pensioners laid 400 square metres of cobblestones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also honoured by the Member of the national Parliament, Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were spoken to the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the Planning Office, who announced a donation to the club ’ s youth department.
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that recurrent weather-related influences in the spring and autumn placed the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played.
As early as 15 years ago, the first thoughts were given to how to solve the problem when consideration was given to building a third place at the site of the football club or at the Realschule on the Salinensee.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago, ideas arose about creating an artificial turf sports field, which was widely regarded as the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were started two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Eritlecht, promised to share EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square and approved the country of EUR 104 000.
The local council decided in October 2012 to cover the remaining EUR 356 000 in the total cost of EUR 560 000, Klumpp.
Construction of the 68 x 108 metre artificial turf pitch began on 4 June.
During the more than three months of construction, 3000 cubic metres of land were extracted, half of which was used to build a Dirt bike route.

These should include dual citizenship, on which both sides have opposing ideas.
The Party of European Socialists wants to end the obligation on German-born immigrant children to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on this Friday's agenda, the SPD underlined its opposition to a passenger car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a " flat rate for often driving and thus ecologically counterproductive, " explained Florian Pronold, the SPD negotiator on transport in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of alternative traffic on country roads, which are already the main focus of accidents.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would only be a first step from Pronold's point of view.
" There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be withdrawn at a later stage, " he said.

Vienna Airport lishes passenger calls
Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Forects such as this will no longer be made at Vienna Schwechat Airport in future.
Most of the loudspeakers are thus omitted - the noise level is to be significantly lowered.
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere.
As airport Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport is following an international trend by setting announcements concerning individuals.
Airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai, among others, are already refraining from noisy calls.
The elimination of these announcements - on average of around 200 personal calls from the loudspeakers one day - should be quieter at the airport in the future.
" Experience has also shown that these individual announcements have been relatively little noticed, but at the same time all other information on changed flight or departure departure times is somewhat lost here, " says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.

Overview of Milk and egg alternatives
Vegan nutrition requires alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
purified tofu with a plant flag, for example, is a quark-substitute.
Another is mentioned by the Vegetarian Federation for the World Day on November 1st.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on November 1, the German Vegetarian Association proposes a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, replace yoghurt with soya yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, oatmeal, almond or rice milk can be used.
Expected plant flags replaces conventional whipped cream.

Slepless in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, Black Forest Gymnasium students met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we set straight for Brooklyn Bridge, which walked to the heart of the city, Manhattan.
This already offered a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time delay, students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but according to the motto " The city does not sleep " the day at Times Square was decided.
Despite Shutdown, the Statue of Liberty was reached by ferry on the second day and reached on foot.
Then we went across the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of September 11.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city from the 373 metre high viewing platform of the Empire-State Building while enjoying the views.
Afterwards, the hustle and bustle of New York streets passed the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which was an ideal opportunity to stay a short break in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, students have now arrived in their host families and are experiencing everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
This year, a Hubertus mass will be celebrated on the name of Saint Hubertus ’ s name Day in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the legend of a rather ruthless hunter, converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn brass group of the hunters Westphalia, led by Brigitte Kluth, plays on Parforchorns (natural horns in the mood Es) for old, originally French melodies.
The brass wear equestrian clothing, because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog dogs on tow hunting.
The festive trade fair will take place on Sunday, November 3rd, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to the encyclopaedia, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling that one has experienced or seen a new situation.
If visiting the homonymous cafe at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve within sight of the University of Applied Sciences Rhine-Waal, you don ’ t have to stop the feeling of déjà Vu feeling.
After all, precisely the aim of the cafe with its beautiful name: to make a real stay not only in terms of thought, but also always tangible.
Because it's fun and beautiful.
A glance into the interior of Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling immediately.
The ultra-modern but not cool cafe ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team, together with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top, spoils the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail options.
There are also delicious cakes or individually cooked fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves as restaurants even before the opening of the pretty Café at the Opschlag: they ran the " Art Lounge " in Kranenburg.
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag, the friendly cafe lovers are hoping for more audience.
Not least through the university.
" While we don't have a specific target group, " Daniel Büttner.
Rather, I would like to appeal to the two young students here as well as senior citizens and all ages in between.
Speaking of cafe lovers.
The likeable couple is behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew yourself in a variety of variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more the express fan and Mirjam van der Stent the cappuccino drinker.
" A baguette - that's my thing, " tells the NRZ.
There have also been two events in the bright cafe.
Better put one thing.
After all, the port festival took place - Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also Ringelnatzabend.
The two 33-year-olds found to be " beautiful, successful and funny ".
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps that is why Daniel Büttner is not a fan of events: " You can't please everyone ".
And with an event I only address those who are interested in the special event.
That is why events will be the exception.
" We want to disrupt normal operation as little as possible ".
This Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products on offer here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which is increasingly becoming a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many Klevers, guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastronomic Mile and the Café Déjà Vu.

The UN proclaims New Poverty Reduction Goals
From now on, the United Nations is starting to develop a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals to combat poverty, announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began this evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “ Sustainable Development Goals ” to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expire in 2015.
They have been included in the final draft document that will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared at the summit this evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests. ”
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch a process to agree universal, sustainable development goals, ” he said.
“ These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by member states in order to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the Millennium Development Goals. ”
Even though the SG Achim / Baden hasn ’ t won for four match days, the mood of the handball league ue is still good.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves absolutely no doubt about that.
All of them remain fully motivated in the matter.
However, I hope that we will finally win again.
" I don't know how such a victory looks like, " Malmon expects his team to experience of success at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Although the third-league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet pulled out any trees, Malmon raises the finger warning beforehand.
I trained many players myself in A-youth.
They will therefore be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
" Furthermore, it has to be seen whether will be any reinforcement from the first, " explains the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon-team needs to increase compared to previous appearances.
Above all, there was a huge lack of cover and switchover.
Opportunities must definitely be improved.
So I hope that my players finally got their heads during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in central Maputunder the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique ’ s founder of the state and president, to support peace calls in a rare public demonstration.
“ We want peace, we want stability, ” said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
Fearing the future of the country, it exchanged its business clothes for a T-shirt labeled ‘ We demand security ’ in Portuguese and, which joined the crowd in the capital ’ s Independence Square on Thursday.
For the last two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo among the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa, in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts are unlikely to slip back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of vast gas resources off the coast and coal stores in the northwest could spin more than $50 billion in the coming years by companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelimo, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members on 17 October in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamos.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renama bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group ’ s leader, Renamos told spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organisation of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play concerns about instability.
He told AFP, AFFrench news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama regarded himself a “ loser ” who “ wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government. ”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize they want to avoid war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo is abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously, ” said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
“ We have here adult adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide their heads, ” says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pressing for electoral reform, has already said that she will boycott November ’ s local elections.
Presidential and legislative elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, Movimento, established by a former Renama member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – who is due to resign when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy.
‘ He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency, ’ Mazanga says.
It is unclear what the capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out troublesome attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South link.
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira, the port used by mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique, ” Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already concerned about corruption, slow development progress, and a recent wave of kidnapping.
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future, and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems, ” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people simply wanted stability.
“ No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again, ” he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ role models, ” one author says.
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks, ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
But many of the myths are “ far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools, ” is why Crossley Holland advocated “ careful selection ” age-appropriate works.
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America, ” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that authors and teachers who are “ overly didactic ” will “ shut down ” children completely, because the messages are “ subliminal. ” in entertaining. ”
Crossley Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Valley, declared, “ You can have certain intentions, but you should preferably keep them in the background. ”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or led to a happy ending, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminal, history must reveal it, not explain it.
That is the old story of rather than telling.

Shrill Pipes Disrupts residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships over the stockpile.
The company has several iron in fire at its site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind binine logistics.
Coal shimmers black on the camp in front of the dike.
Two massive blue dumping and return loading devices distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every time the handling move, a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
" The signals serve safety and are required by law, " says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
If the wind is unfavourable, this can unfortunately be heard widely - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city order.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quieter by means of technical measures.
He will continue to rely on open dialogue with his neighbours.
Matthias Schrell still has a lot to go at the site.

Thanks to the bathtub in front of the terminal, which is deepened at 18.5 metres, capesize bulk carriers can long since be processed here.
" This year we want to crack the 3 million tonne mark in the envelope, " says Schrell.
In addition to the local power plant, imported coal goes to inland power stations.
Add to that the GDF Suez power plant comes to the grid, just over 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three loaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bavaria ’ s Basketball baller Despite its First Defeat
Even the first defeat in Euroleague could not diminish the enormous optimism of the FC Bayern Munich basketball players.
" Nobody can prohibit us from believing from winning against the best team in Europe in the last two years, " said Bavarian Coach Svetislav Pesic noted after the unhappy 83: 88 (39: 47) on Thursday evening at the title defender Olympic's Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
During their third appearance in the European premier class, the Munich sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed the trick of converting a 15-point delay 13 minutes before the end of a guided tour, before Piraeus made the game turn around again.
" We fought unbelievably back against the two-time Euroleagua Champion, but then made reckless mistakes again, " said Bavarian professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers in Munich who celebrated clear victories in the first two matches against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title bearer Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd jokes directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay ’ s innovation has expanded, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“ Most of these headliners began with Carolines and became increasingly successful until they were too known to perform in a club, ” Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so we can continue working with them.
This year ’ s event will feature performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy charity event for army evetans in the Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform.
The world of comedy has grown with the festival.
A number of the comedians taking part in this year ’ s festival have become known through more unconventional channels, such as programmes on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic slippery fantasy football series The League on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series “ Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll as well as Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic racial W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has become a respected television and film director and unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a television show titled “ Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg ” at TV Land.
The meeting will be held in the Town Hall in mid-Manhattan.
“ The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry ’ s entire work, ” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he is here, he sometimes walks through the alleyway between two buildings and thinks himself: Hey, if I lose all my money, perhaps I will live here.
Iran ’ s Nuclear Negotiations Process
One week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany is satisfied with the negotiation process.
" After years, an agreement has now been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years, " Foreign Minister Mohamed Javad Sarif on his Facebook page.
There is still a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and optimistic that both sides will eventually find a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys playmates with machete
Two children in Uruguay admitted the murder of an 11-year-old.
The two boys 14 and 12 years old had invited their victim to go hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they climbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper " El País " on Thursday.
They would then have played football in front of their homes in a working-class district.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 km north of the exclusive resort Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the young who who took her with her was to testify that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the course of day in front of the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
One of the reasons given by the elderly was rivalry in the football match.
He was admitted to a psychiatric youth institution for the time being.
Pimps Must Prison
For exploitative trafficking in human beings, pimping, threat, three and a half years in prison for exploitative trafficking has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georto threat, insult and dangerous injury.
The former military soldier, who worked as a door-stand after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession in trial.
So, in five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent against their will after a few weeks.
He used to break violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women, some of whom have acquired for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he prevented women contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitored to control their revenue.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after the deaths of colleagues in Afghanistan next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert alled serious doubts about mental constraints and thus about reduced guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women.
As one crio official reported, after initial notification through telephone surveillance, at least four other cases of exploitative trafficking in human beings were identified.
The intercepted talks have been one of great aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured parties would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness in which one of the women had discovered blue spots on the whole body has not yet made any testimony.
It is a' a completely broken person' who sees violence and exploitation in this profession to be normal.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
" He has detached himself from these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after imprisonment, " he said.
The price of oil continues to Rink to USD 96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, as worries about high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference timber variety for deliveries in e-commerce in Europe on the New York Mercantile Exchange in December had fallen by 14 cents to USD 96.24 a barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a 5.8% fall in prices in October.
The wide range of crude oil has put a burden on prices in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy declared on Wednesday that the US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were signs of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This suggests a continued recovery in China ’ s economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8% in the third quarter, having been at its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude oil, a reference value for international crude oil also used by US refineries, fell 26 cents on the ICE Exchange in London to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD stop and risk policy
On Thursday, a federal Appeal Court in the USA blocked the order of a judge who had called for changes to the stop and risk program (“ stop and search ”) of the New York police department, and released the judge.
The Second US Court of Appeal declared that Judge Shira Scheindlin ’ s decisions would be suspended until a decision on an appeal to the city.
The judge ruled in August that the city was in breach of the Constitution with the way in which the program for stopping and questioning people was being implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to help the police amend their policy and training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments called for suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge should be released from the case where she breached the Code of Conduct for US judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality, partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she responded publicly to the Court ’ s criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they unduly targeted black and Latin American men with the stop and crisis programme.
She appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy, training and service supervision reforms, and ordered a pilot programme with body-borne cameras in neighbourhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people dismissed after police control.
An oral hearing on the appointment of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
Stop and risk tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
Such controls have been in place in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the tenure of the non-partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonging to all minorities, lodged legal action, which became a collective redress.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop and risk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as influence the way other police presidents use the scheme.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morality of the police, not crime; nor would money wasted and solve the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure after thousands of jobs were lost in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop -and-risk practice, which is constitutional, but merely reforming the way in which the NYPD implements controls.
Happiness of Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that can achieve only Dreaming Camels.
With this Bedouin wisdom the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association " Helfende Hand ".
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which has already had considerable success.
The first chairman, Mr Henne, reported on the work of the association.
He himself was first in Mauritania at the Cheijk-Zajedhospital in Nouakchott in 2004.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on the ground on several journeys.
During the speeches, pictures of the inserts were shown on a big screen, so that the guests of the jubilee event could get an idea of the above-mentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former federal border guards vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, proposed that this vehicle should be equipped with a photovoltaic system and, according to the Henne, is now planning to act in an advisory role with the association.
In 2008, in record time of less than a week, Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn built the hospital in Socogim, a slty on the outskirts of the capital - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the obstetriclinic in Nagold is to be nationalized.
There is a lot in Africa as a doctor, Henne, for example, slowdown against burn-out.
The political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many journeys as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to reflect in various areas.
Containers containing material are also regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, dressing materials, hospital beds and glasses in March of this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered plenty of local colour by telling about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile brick stable from Mauritania and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians who traditionally supported the club during their journey to Mauritania.
As his personal motives, he referred to his work in auditing as a young MEP.
When he realized how much money had been lost along the way, he decided to help Africans to control a budget.
Fuchtel also emphasized that the global economy also demands global love of human beings.
Nor should it be borne in mind that Africa is closer than some people think.
Not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip.
The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “ telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip about an affair involving then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive Advisor, ” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack and follow Pawlby's voicemails, but Coulson also called them and left behind messages as the court learned.
“ In the opinion of the public prosecutor ’ s office, Coulson, who is now the publisher of NotW, is not one standing in front of people ’ s homes and hopes to catch them for fresh action, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction, ” Edis explained.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories investigatively: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, monitoring, it cannot be otherwise.
What about the first?
Is he about telephone hacking?
He denies that, but we say, “ And whether he knew about it. ”
Rumors of a Clark ’ s affair were first taken up by NotW ’ s feature editors, when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was said, “ Don ’ t waste your time, it ’ s together with Charles. ”
A band of voice emails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective ’ s computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects. ”
During the time as the research was under way, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, explained Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Pawlby movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her with a voicemail with the following: “ I have a story that we want to release tomorrow I would like to talk to Charles. ”
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had confronted a married woman because of an affair when he himself lifted the fellow defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup phone hacking.
French football will go through the first strike since 1972 1972 in protest at the planned empire tax.
A conciliation meeting will end.
In the imperial tax conflict, the government and professional football in France have manoeuvred themselves into an impasse following a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of clubs and associations at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and also listened to their complaints.
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75% levy on income of more than EUR 1 million per year, which all the country ’ s firms are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side remained firm.
Jean-Pierre Louvel, the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCthat the strike announced at the end of November, will now be completed.
The days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between 29 November and 2 December are cancelled.
Gechingen: No absolute protection
" We want to involve the residents early on in the planning stage, " Mayor Jens Häusler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the Municipal Hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and contribute ideas.
Hexterder made it clear:' The final decisions are taken by the members of the local council'.
The floods that hit Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009 were a major event that raised the question of protection for the future, Häusler says.
A river basin study had been commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
" The aim is to protect as many cultivated land as possible, " says Häusler.
The planning is based on the protection against floods to are expected every 100 years according to the German weather service, statistically expected every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
This is called " HQ 100aKlima ".
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 were a 1000 year flooding.
" There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement, " says Häusler.
In order to achieve the protection of the HQ 100aKlima, around EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality expecting national subsidies of around 70%.
Hwarders pointed out, however, that there is only support if an overall concept is implemented.
To this end, the municipality needs the participation of its citizens.
An expensive planning and authorisation procedure would have to be completed.
At best, implementation can begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept that was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) provides for local measures in the tributary of the river Irm from the Stammheim Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to put forward their concerns.
Amongst other things, it has been questioned as to why more dams and reservoirs are not being planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it requires the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal as a whole.
In addition, the most economical solution should be found, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
There was resentment among those living in the Alort, who suffer congestion on the channel network, even in normal thunderstorms.
The problem is well known in administration and initial measures have already been taken.
Hexterder pointed out, however, that the directives for canal systems are different from those for flood prevention, and that this should not be confused.
The municipality is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be cope with.
Large the sewers would devour millions.
Serious Injuries after Clilisions
In the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a head-on collision on the road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police closed the street immediately, but could say little about the accident at first.
However, there are various testimony that should be evaluated.
It is certain that the 19-year-old handlewoman of a VW Golf went towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so heavily trapped that it took the fire brigade barely half an hour to free her from the wrek.
The real cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
Both came to nearby hospitals.
The track remained closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a God seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serious.
What is amazing is the relationship on the exterior: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
Just as Fjodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who is regarded at home.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans-cassette with its 118 narratives distriells two thousand.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, obsession with security, and the belief that they are chosen.
Dick had God experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, he had added drugs to his brain.
He realized early on that the computers are divinties.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a human being from a machine, the Creator from his creation.
That is Blade Runner problem.
.
A science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The " Minority Report " dates back to 1956 and exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
The principle of " pre-crime ", " pre-crime ", is being developed here, what has become a more or less official White House doctrine.
In thick thick's world, frighteningly resembles ours, mutants look to the future - and the police are approaching.
" We record individuals who have not violated any law, " says the head of the authority.
'We grab them before they can commit a violent crime'.
And:' There are no serious criminals in our society, but we have a criminal camp full of pesudo criminals' they read time streams.
They assume that the worst is happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Thick's narrative looks like the blueprint for anti-terrorist laws and the NSA's eavesdropping.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama ’ s philosophy and practice works.
But thick story is not yet over.
The chief of police complains that there is no longer any separation, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system rotates.
It is perfect, but it lies.
It invents its own preconditions.
Not only accepts errors and sacrifices, but also builds on them.
The system creates the danger that it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth.
Russia ’ s Late Testifying Merkel
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the late affair of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Bar Association could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, according to Interfax.
Prior to that, member Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to discuss the affair with him.
NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew across the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
At the request of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Internal Intelligence Service, he was to photograph the roof of the US foreign post, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas, and the action led to an exchange of words between the USA and the German Foreign Department in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US did not use foreign espionage “ to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US firms so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profits. ”
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistlelow-lower member, began publishing his fffle of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business bosses are no longer sure that they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has sped on Brazil ’ s oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company ’ s paranoia to a new level over government surveillance.
The camel's back broke the revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone had been blurred, perhaps for a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then management are certainly potential.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
“ Germany must wake up, ” explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US is now almost as great a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting EY.
So far, however, Snowden ’ s documents have shown no evidence that the US has passed on foreign companies ’ trade secrets to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet facilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Businesses are sceptical about this.
It was proposed in the Bundestag that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
“ That ’ s not how it works, ” says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If we had wanted a strong European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except for the IT industry.
Yet the scope and technical subtlety of the US spy authorities, revealed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen China ’ s risk of spying.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change, because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to their jurisdiction and is therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, following revelations about US data mining activities with Prism, about 10% of non-US members rejected plans to use an American vendor.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says, “ We see a new question from customers that did not exist a year ago – where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this jurisdiction? ”
Many German business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that they must therefore be guarded at all costs.
It is no surprise that industrial espionage is taking place.
This has always been the case.
“ It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed as a result of the current discussion, ” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate governance does not usually boast about the remedies that have been taken, because that brings advantages to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been convinced that it is not advisable to take a free USB stick at a trade fair or leave a laptop unattended in the hotel room, to put it mildly.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of car manufacturers Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones in front of a board meeting so that they cannot be used as eesdropping devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
There is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niche.
“ Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, human resources and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorised access, ” the BVT warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies against industrial espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February ranked France, Russia, and Israel behind China among the countries countries to obtain hacking economic data.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed when it comes to business espionage, “ the French are the worst. ”
Bernard Squarcini, a former head of the DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month: “ The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies. ”
Hechingen: Messe answers to wedding questions
" Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery man, " said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding ceremony was now given by a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Important providers were represented around a wedding.
One trend: the retro look.
This starts with the wedding clothes, for example.
White must, best covered or in cream.
In the front, the often troubled and embroidery are closed, often with a veil, but back they go down their backs and often end up in tow.
However, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes, the spirits divide from the fashion house Kleidermüller.
In men, the waistcoat and Plastron suit dominates, but creamy or brown combinations can also be chosen.
Important is the selection of the place, was explained.
The room was very small and the bed was uncomfortable and uncomfortable.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remise.
If you want to drive a coach, Uwe Link has an offer.
" carriages are also popular for young fwellwell, " he says.
Romanticism is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The " After-Wedding photo " is becoming more and more fashionable - in other words recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangements, rings, wedding tables, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not forgetting the right cosmetic and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable feast.
Successful
Once again the athletes of dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally service tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the Beginner class and won fifth, and with the 15-month old Marley he scored 12th with 87 points.
With her woody in class 1, Susi Höpp faced the critical gaze of the funnel.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled mat in the gymnasium of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in an upright mat behind the grandstand in the Schulturnhalle.
The Sheriff of Lowndes County investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old family doubted this.
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered, ” explained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed that he died as the Sheriff concluded.
“ They believe that it has no logic to violate the laws of both physics as well as common sense, ” Crump says.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be concealed up in order to protect the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
“ Her son went to school and came back in her body bag, ” he comments.
US Public Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into Johnson ’ s death, because a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whichever direction they lead.
My aim is to find out the truth.
“ I believe that there is sufficient basis for formal investigation, ” he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of “ positional suffocation. ”
According to Moore, however, a second auopsy had revealed a different cause of death.
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed, ” he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson ’ s death, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of County Sheriffs was not ready to comment immediately at our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities release all the surveillance videos checked by the investigators.
The teenager ’ s parents said that they hoped that the video recordings would indicate how he died.
CDCs publish school allergy Guidelines
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines that the US government has issued as the number of children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has food allergy.
According to the CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness among teachers and staff of food allergies and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrin in stock – the EpiPen brand auto injection is the most commonly used – to deal with a potentially lethal oversensitivity reaction.
State legislators have recently changed the regulations to make it easier to keep epinephrin to stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms referred to by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, ‘ It feels as if something is pressing on my tongue ’, ‘ My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it ’ or ‘ My tongue crawles ’.
Parents of Intersexual Children Can Choose “ Gender Indeterminate ”
Germany is the first European nation to recognise a third sex for children born with ambiguous genitals.
Newborn babies are no longer assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can indicate “ indeterminate ” or “ unfixed ” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to relieve the pressure on parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding gender allocation operations in newborn babies and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
An intersexual person said, according to the BBC, years later, “ I ’ m neither a man nor a woman. ”
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is not born either as a boy or girl each year.
They are intersexuals, a group covered by the diagnosis of “ Sexual Differation Disorder ” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles), or unusually developed genitals.
Valais Simpson may have been intersexual.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise using the best available information for gender allocation if a provision is not possible, and not wait for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding on an operation, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “ sounds like a good cause. ”
Intersexual children are ethical dilemma.
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention, but most children not, ” he said.
You can assign gender without an operation and then wait and see how identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity at all is not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it is happening.
It is like secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission stated that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender, but is based on their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defines both simultaneously or clearly as one of them.
These characteristics were reflected in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and statures, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in working life, as well as of the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who do not match the gender image now have a special camp.
In the meantime, in Australia and Nepal, it is possible for adults to indicate male, female or “ third sex ” on official documents.
In June, Australians Norrie May-Welby (52) recognized as the world ’ s first “ genderless ” person, after a court granted an “ undefined ” gender status for lifetime.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German identity cards will in future have a third assignment alongside M and W, X for intersexual.
Gender issues are still controversial in neighbouring France, according to France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “ gender theory ” from textbooks.
The US Catholic Online website has also opposed German law, on the grounds that “ When the world is dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we distort two more pillars of civilization. ”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she liked it better to assign a sex to babies at birth.
“ Parental is already stressful enough, even without further restrictions, especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your child, ” she told her parents ’ s website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born of both male and female sexes have been called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Just ten years ago, medicine saw gender as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical basis of an operation are being called into question, now that we know how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when they grow up with the sex they assign.
“ In the mid-twentieth century, one was called psychiatric emergency, ” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist who was called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of the treatment of children with ambiguous genita stems from Dr. John Money of John ns Hopkins University, who argued that gender was formable.
He coined the term “ gender identity, ” arguing that social and environmental initiatives – such as parents raise a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones, shaping whether a person considers himself male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as “ John / Joan, ” his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then bring him up as a girl.
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion, which was not, ” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male family and married a woman.
At the age of 38 committed suicide.
According to Dresden, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990 ’ s, when the Internet came, survivors of these gender operations, who are “ unhappy with the outcome ” came public.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana author born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genita.
Doctors were unclear whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was brought up as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
“ I knew not a girl, ” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he was to receive a vaginal plastic.
But being depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded his medical acts.
What he was shocking.
I was sterilised at birth – and nobody ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD, through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitalials.
After learning the truth, he returned to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation has become infertile as a result.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the Californibased Advocates for Informed Choice ice law group, worries that German law can “ encourage stamp and stigmatisation. ”
“ Many activists are concerned that Germany ’ s decision might encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign “ unfixed, ” to the child, ” she declared.
We fear that this will encourage intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we do not yet know what the impact of the law will be, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports Australian law, because ‘ it allows adults to be recognized as the third sex ’.
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex, ” she explained.
German law is about allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force young children at this stage.
When they are adult, they can decide on their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a brother stradiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that German law “ empower ” both parents and children.
Katie, daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Katie developed female characteristics due to the defect of the target cells for testosterone.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works as a psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
It is infertile, but hopes to have a child through adoption or surrogate mother.
“ The law gives scope for parents to rush decisions, ” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify matters, giving them time before writing “ male ” or “ female. ”
In this way everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the parental happiness.
And you do not have to rush to carry out an operation that can no longer be undone.
“ This includes the children in the decision and removes the fear that drives parents because they believe that they won ’ t doing the right thing, ” she explained.
Ultimately, it is the child that decides on the sex that suits him or her – and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own decision.
Unknown injure Girls by Shot from Car
Unknown people have injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when shooting from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired at a group of children with an air pressure weapon on Thursday evening.
The police in the castle announced this.
The girl was easily injured on the left.
Rescue took the girl to hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
They then drove away from it.
The criminal police have been investigated on Friday.
To date, the Kempten police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were only called twice to throwing children, throwing them against house facades.
Since the owners recognized this in good time and removed the remains of the eggs immediately, no material damage should have been caused.
In addition, some New Year ’ s Eve bollers were probably set off in the city area, but here, too, no material damage has been done.
A resident of the Bishop Friend's Way reported that his car was wrapped with knopaper and his whelinder apertures were stolen.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found all his cycling apertures in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not need to continue any further.
Living with Future
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old trees, nice neighbours and not much traffic.
It is only a few minutes away by public transport.
" Hopefully you are not afraid of spiders? " asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new flat for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider ’ s phobia, but the concern that she will no longer be able to master the many steps to the house and the flat in old age, she explains.
Moreover, since a Meniscus operation, the mid-fifties has experienced what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
She has just recently published a book on the subject' Happy living in old age - which form of housing is best for me?'
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age', she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the duplex more than 20 years ago, it was simply a beautiful apartment surrounded by greenery.
Today, at the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
She also knows, however, that she is one of the few people dealing with the issue of living in old age.
Most of them are supplanted it as long as possible.
Old are always becoming only the others,' says she smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great will we be thought.
'Then it can be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
" But which form of residence you choose is always an individual decision, " she explains.
D i e e there is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement place in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider falling ill.
And:' Without a good knowledge of the national language, you can also be in the Dolce Vita,' the author of the specialist book expulsions.
Among their models you will find classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often cited pensioners.
In old age, everyone has their own ticks.
'For me, such a shared community would be nothing', she says with a wink.
Not like in a student bathroom with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
" In old age you simply need your retreat, " says Ries.
However, the author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior citizens' home can still work.
But this would then have to be different from the classical student bathroom.
And sometimes you just want your calm,' she believes.
It is not alone, at least in the capital of the country.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own homes as long as possible' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the civil service life in the age of the state capital.
Your service advises people on the subject of becoming older.
That is why the experience of the Foundation Warentest Foundation, the elderly in particular would often accept inconveniences and restrictions only in order to be able to stay in their familiar environment.
Today, however, there are many ways to make the house or the apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who are involved in the reconstruction of their house or flat first obtain thorough information and not hire the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental flat, one thing or two things can be achieved, and if it is only the elevation of the toilet seats, the interior designer will explain.
However, the existing flat is not always possible to be transformed according to the age and thus without barriers, however beautiful it may be.
Waltraud Ries had to experience.
The room was very small and the bathroom was very small.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, it is more horrified to her than in front of the spider at her apartment door.
The US wants to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its stance toward former US intelligence Edward Snowden.
He continues to be accused of having passed on secret information unlawfully.
So said US State Department spokesman Jennifer Psaki aki in Washington, he has to face criminal proceedings in the US.
Nor would recent statements by Snowden change that.
Prior to that, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki emphasized that Ströbel's remarks were those of a parliamentarian, not those of a German member of the government.
Edward Snowden is a secret service manager is ready to talk to the German authorities in principle.
First of all, however, he wants his situation clarified.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee, who the USA sought in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the German government, the German Bundestag, and federal attorneys.
The letter, according to a translation disseminated by Ströbele, has as follows:
Those responsible
I asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I previously previously a or contracted as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
As I worked in these institutions, I have witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which led me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I faced a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I am currently living in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations about a system of comprehensive surveillance that is accountable to no one as a public service.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the formerly covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken have been significantly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a trust and seeks to criminalise and prosecute political expression.
telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this harmful attitude.
I hope that, once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and in accordance with the law in clarifying of the relating to what is made in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to a meeting with you in your country once the situation has been clarified and I thank you for your efforts to respect international law, which protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten Find a Private Purchaser
" The building is in good hands, " says Winterlin's mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality sold the former kindergarten in Gartenstraße to a private person.
At its most recent non-public meeting, the local council approved the sale in the non-public section.
The building changed at a " reasonable price.
" The community is satisfied, " Maier.
EUR 100 000 was earmarked in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former kindergarten.
The mayor has the right that Winterlingen handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and so no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking at the garden and clear the walkway.
" This effort is now gone, " Maier is pleased.
Place concert at summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a concert on the terrace of the Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raised the clock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
Manuela Honeck explains music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully overcome the first music hock.
Obama ’ s Campaign considered replacing Bies with Hillary Clinton
According to the New New York Times, President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers secretly replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign, “ Double Down: Game Change 2012. ”
The Times has a copy of the upcoming book, and reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had held “ extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether dropping beoes is better for Obama ’ s diminaning hope of re-election.
According to Jonathan Martin, The Times ’ s National Political Political correspondent, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of senior officials in the campaign and the White House, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact on the poll figures of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for Vice-President.
The potential change was a tightly guarded secret in the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley, Obama ’ s former campaign leader, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change.
Double down claims that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange beds, despite their “ close personal relationship, ” before finally choosing not to move, after data show that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances. ”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had indeed considered replacing with Clinton.
“ I said a lot of things to consider, and that was one of them, ” Daley told the magazine.
It is worth remembering that the President had dreadful poll polls at the time, so we thought, “ For God ’ s sake, what are we doing? ”
While Daley described the investigations as “ due care, ” Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that considerable efforts had been made during the re-election campaign to whether such a move paid off in terms of the ballot box.
“ In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t think seriously about something, ” Martin explained on AC360.
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential change.
While Daley declared that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that double down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether political explorations have reached Obama ’ s desk.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thinks Obama knew nothing about investigations into whether to drop bees in the election.
“ Possible Martin replied.
What happens on the way to my email?
E-mail actually means electronic letter.
Has e-mail secrecy been technically implemented in the design of the Internet service, similar to conventional postal service?
The early Internet services was on making communication possible.
That is why the basic technical protocols have not taken care to create a solid foundation for an auditible exchange of letters.
As a result, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user " Anna " sends a mail to " Benni ", are the computers of the two then directly connected?
The first step Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the mail to her service provider's mail server.
For example, if it has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can be sent via many other servers on the Internet.
The content can then call your provider.
Are traditional e-mails being read through the net?
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the way to go.
The sender's provider, it is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also performed on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether this is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertisements.
When Anna and Benni communicate by mail about their upcoming mail, Google may display links to holiday offers.
Do also unknown people read the e-mails?
There is very little likelihood that unauthorised people will read a mail.
In theory, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mails.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means of intercept or take e-mails.
There are also possible illegal spying.
Is it possible to protect e-mails?
Encryption according to the OpenPGP standard can effectively encrypt an e-mail against reading.
With great technical effort it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not easy to recognize who communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a survey by Convios Consulting in August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo Mail had fallen, GMail from Google was able to increase significantly.
Mother of Hidden in the Forest
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and care benefits.
In order to be able to continue collecting a pension and care benefits, a 67-year-old Wolfsburg buried his dead mother in the forest after investigating the police.
First he covered up the death of the 89-year-olds, and then he collected the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old must answer for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected as early as May: it became apparent that medicines were no longer needed for the dependent mother.
The pensioner was told that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this was strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common flat for more than 15 years and that he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old the death of his mother.
Observation, according to the police, showed no evidence of a capital crime.
Feel like ice cream in the dark?
A British entrepreneur developed the first dark ice using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals to create a luminous treat.
He came up with the idea after reading research into jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to produce the bright protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when eaten, increasing the pH value in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the ice cream responds to the warmth in the mouth and shines – so the more you lick, the lighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I ’ m Delicious, says, “ The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, so you get two grams of it for £200. ”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue to a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH and the ice rises.
We ’ ve tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to us to launch it on Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made, because the jellyfish luminaire is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me £140.
But for that.
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is even more ambitious.
He says, “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream. ”
This is impossible in itself because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make ice cream, but I suspect we find a way to doing it.
The ice cream fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
After six match days, the TSV Morsum is still without any points in the Handball league.
Now, of all, the team of Ingo Ehlers will see the derby against the TSV Daverden tomorrow, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game starts again for us.
" I hope we finally have our heads clear, " Ehler is cautiously optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has his complete board at his disposal.
Like us, Daverden relies on speed.
We must therefore keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, we need to increase the coverage that has recently left anything but certain.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that ’ s why we ’ re far from being our favorite, because everything can always happen in the derby.
However, Panitz now wants to add Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat missing.
To this end, the A-teenager Joost Windßß, who is active with double rights at the A-Youth Bundesliga player HC Bremen, is making his seasonal debut.
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and disguise us for the neighbourhood.
Today I have become a halloween muffler.
Over the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home, and I do not think I will do so this year.
But according to the statistics I am a black sheep as far as Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and decorations, according to the US Retailers Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, says the NRF.
This year, inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to dress in sexy clothes, they can now embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that the Daft-Punk space enthusiasts will make it into the instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are Zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not alone.
Indeed, according to the NRF, Americans spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
As it comes to sweets, we are not squeamished.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, slippers, candies and rubber bears.
So good news for the US Department of Commerce, according to the US Department of Commerce, who are wandering through the neighborhood with the slogan “ sweet or sour. ”
Indeed, we will buy and, not deleive ourselves, eat more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween.
The only thing we do not want to consume is sugar-sweet candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Conectionery Manufacturers.
That is about nine billion grains of the corn.
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve.
Nothing belongs to Halloween than houses where it spits.
They have great names such as “ Terror Behind the Walls ” (which, by the way, is in a real prison), “ howO cream ” and “ The House of Shock ’.
Indeed, there are 1,200 officially recognized spug houses in the United States that yield $500 million, according to America Haunts, including the wonderful photos you are peeing into your trousers and then putting your friends on Facebook, where you can ’ t get rid of them, and then leaving you with you with a comment like “ nice facial expression. ”
But let us finally move on to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and carving a pumpkin lamp is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from a very young age.
Fortunately, the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend only began last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin, not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lamp that slowly rotates in the front garden probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score points right, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something nice from their 921 kilos pumpkin.
Housing in Helmbrerecht: Rescue services charred corpses
The fire brigade had to leave in helmet late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire at night.
The rescue services are taking a charred body out of the house.
During a fire in Helmbrerecht, rescue services found a charred corpse in a three-family house.
Whether it is a resident is unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
Late Thursday evening it burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames out of a window.
The staff went to the flat and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned down completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents had not been at home during the fire, the police spokesman.
The building is no longer.
The exact cause of the fire was unclear at first.
Germany ’ s largest state church has been offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030 according to the current situation.
Today ’ s young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burographi( 43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the course of work and day for yourself.
With Burographi, for the first time, the Landeskirche commissioned a pastor in a full body to inspire young people to the study of theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people, after their baccalaureate, are choosing to study theology.
Burographiascribes this to the process of ececesiinization: " God's voice is quiet, the world is loud ".
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my calendar and I can set my priorities where it matters to me.
Pastors could be close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could well make a living from it.
To be sure, more would be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a sure employer for that.
This suits today ’ s young people, who are not only concerned with careers, but also with meaningful work.
According to the State Church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring every year.
At the same time, some 40 graduates of a study of theology start their victerial service.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burographiaims to organise study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The theology offer a broad education.
You can even become President with it.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interior features racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system.
Options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with Bowler work mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “ The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed. ”
They are not all experienced cyclists, but people in search of excitement and adventure, as well as an accessible path to world-class events.
We are pleased to open up this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the strain and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge includes a February training and testing day and the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade to save a bitch who was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock promontory in a quarry.
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had gone after a minor road accident.
Three days later, it was discovered by a walker in the quarry in its unfortunate position.
Fire men on the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death.
The fire brigade succeeded in safety a bitch who was stuck on a 15 metre high lead in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had left after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, to whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service fire fighters.
They had desperately looked for their missing bitch and published cries for help on social networks when she entered the quarry after the minor road accident.
Around 14: 15 on Wednesday, a walker running his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team at Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and swped off to save Ruby, which was then transported upwards in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “ She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock face – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move any muscle during her rescue – she was like a stiff.
But now doing well.
She then eate a few dog cakes.
This was quite an unusual task.
The fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said, “ Ruby had a huge fortune. ”
There was a possibility that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “ Watching the rescue was frightening. ”
I could not believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back in their arms.
The veterinarian said that if exhaustion had become too great and collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The fire-fighters have done a great job.
What they did was really courageous.
We are just thankful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “ We were afraid she would fall down, but she remained at the top. ”
The fire-fighters were great.
I hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains that he never did Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she had worked on Jagger ’ s 2004 song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” as a background singer.
Perry declared that she had had dinner with the alrock and that “ he had amed me when I was 18 ”.
She added, “ It ’ s a long time ago and he was very kind to me. ”
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70, said that he “ categorically denies that he had ever sought Katy Perry. ”
The representative added, “ Perhaps confused him with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance during this year ’ s Rolling Stones tour.
Their new album “ Prism ” immediately reached Number 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European Unbundling gives the Scots
A new day, a new story of horrors for independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This is the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the Hadrian Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the potential economic benefits that greater freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this did not matter in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more favourable to them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in exchange for what it really want from the Scots.
So no story.
And one that has come over the years that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the ‘ independence means passport controls ’ duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European tune?
Why trade the London yoke for Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project officially died.
Parties across the EU that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – won almost five million votes in the September federal election, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
But the current economic crisis is proving to be a turning point.
Many people believe that the European project has gone too far because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket into which their national economies are forced by adherence to the single currency.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments creating excessive budget deficits – only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code to subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times for gas as the United States.
This is a paralysing disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being marginalised by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt, especially in France, the EU ’ s former cheerleader.
After the war, France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle for keeping Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and has imposed Europe ’ s own economic policies, which is what the battered French economy is struggling with.
As a result, Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive afterelection, putting the ruling socialists in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing divide would automatically benefit the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newfound popularity among the working-class white French?
It wants to use next year's EU elections to forge an anti-EU anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is perfectly possible – then such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I would like to make: in the not-too-distant future, growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more of the “ Europe of (sovereign) nations ” that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may be holding fast to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the United States.
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is all this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately) England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can get where.
I suspect Scotland could do very well in a looser European grouping if we retained our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, and won a spectacular majority in 2011 by rejecting the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Treasury Secretary Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dems coalition were responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now only to impose austerity by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as research shows.
Physical Change does not directly mean Adolescence
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals.
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a cause of early puberty
The trend toward Early Adolescence is Less pronounced among Boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried when her daughter's breasts and shame grow at the age of seven or eight?
At this week ’ s annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is not a sign that puberty is happening quickly, ” Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious indications of development, such as growing breasts, shame and armpit hair, and body odors, can be seen in girls earlier.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarches (occurrence of the first blood) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5, slightly 12.75 in 1970.
“ When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to reach Menarche, ” said Kaplowitz, author of the book “ Early Puberty in Girls: The essential guide for dealing with this frequently occurring problem ”.
Time is the most accurate test of how adolescence progresses.
It is controversial what actually marks the beginning of adolescence, but it is “ premature ” if breast enlargement is accompanied by a surge in growth the age of eight years ago.
In most cases, the process slows or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
As progress faster faster, encronologist tests may be appropriate to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and avert another consequence: premature bone aging, which can ultimately lead to inbrament in growth and thus small adult growth.
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, speed of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medicines, but he admits, “ suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings of being different from their fellow peers. ”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
“ They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side, ” Kaplowitz said.
“ It was a shock, ” remembers a woman whose daughter received her days at the age of ten.
Although there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was emotionally prepared.
She came home with anxiety and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early adolescence.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual embassies in the media are caused.
Boys, like girls in the past, enter adolescence.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is obesity epidemic.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls between the ages of six and nine, which would link body fat to the entry into adolescence.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that have played a role.
In that country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations.
Globally, early adolescence seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to the climate to genes.
Another puzzle is that although boys ’ ial hair is growing earlier, the trend towards full former puberty is not as strong as that of girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and shamhair is common even among babies and toddlers.
“ We must be careful about identifying the true beginning of puberty, ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“ This can mean that you have to have a conversation sooner than expected, ” Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than expected.
Jumbo manufacturers argue seat width in the face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers about the breadth of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at this month ’ s Dubai Airshow.
The dispute revolves around the range of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those most concerned by airlines, but this designated designated is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard requiring a width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US archrival Boeing says that should is up to the airlines to decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the back part of the aircraft is structured – in particular, whether there are nine-or ten-seat rows – is crucial to the stated economic results that the new “ mini jumbo ” design is supposed to deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 777X ” can accommodate 406 people for seats in the tourist class that are more than 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus states that the competing version of the A350 transporcarry 350 people in 18 inch seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share blows over technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus appeals to the public directly before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take the race with more than 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could mark the start of a new war on advertising, showing donors an image in which three people squeezed in a restaurant with the title title “ Would you accept that? ”
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo props, ” says Airbus Chief Sales Officer John Leahy.
As eating habits change, people are getting fatter, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970 ’ s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, the average male American ’ s weight between 40 and 49 increased by 10%, according to data from the US Department of Health.
According to US health statistics, the average male circumference of the waist American in the twenty-first century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that its rival adheres to a 1950s seating concept, when the average circumference of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrower.
Research have been carried out, according to Airbus, that one additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus figures on the dimensions of seats and says that it is not up to the manufacturers to decide how airlines shape the balance between air fares and establishment.
The company also explains that, according to research, the experience on the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“ It really amounts to giving flexibility to airlines so that they can do what they believe they need in order to succeed, ” explains cabin expert Kent Craver at Boeing.
They do not want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders estimated at at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a major impact on the US or European export balances.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20% more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X, with its ten row seats, is compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than those currently in use with ten seats per row.
“ Boeing is squeezing more seats into its aircraft in order to make it more competitive with our products, ” says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 77s indicated that many passengers have opted for the narrower arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper fares.
“ Eighteen inch seats would be great for passengers, but the reality is that, from an economic point of view, Airbus ’ range is controlled by the threat posed by the 777, ” says Mary Kirby, cabin equipment expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world ’ s jet sellers even carry band dimensions with them to measure the facility in the competition.
Even if they promote comfort, all manufacturers also offer highly condensed jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a ten-seater A350, but says that it has not yet sold.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of greater cabin adaptability and offering wide aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to evaporate, but could distract attention from the wave of 777X sales.
New Anti-nicotine vaccine could destroy the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
More tests are needed before human testing, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of WeiWeill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good.
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help once millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying all the methods available on the market, but have seen that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches, ” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information to produce nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then produce a permanent stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice to which nicotine was given maintained their normal level of activity.
Mce without vaccination, by contrast, would have taken time out, ” researchers explained, a sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Former vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often in order to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if safe, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“ They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel happy because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to get rid of their habit, ” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid
The former minister of the laboratory party, Joe Tripodi, of New South Wales, is being under investigation by the state corruption supervisator.
The former NSW minister denies having amended the maritime lease rules at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who owned hidden holdings in three properties on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigations into whether Obeid influenced various ministers of state to renew lease contracts on Circular Quay, where the Otwo operated two restaurants and a café, without a tender after they expired in August 2005.
It is now being investigated that Tripodi knew of both ’ s hidden interest in land after Tripodi ’ s former Deputy Head of Staff Lynne Ashpole testified on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pressed for public tenders for the lease contracts.
The tenants were opposed to this and also wanted longer runurities.
In 2009, the lease contracts for Circular Quay, which raised $2.5 million annually to the Oworkers, were renewed without public tendering.
Tripodi, Minister of Port from February 2006 to November 2009, originally supported public tenders.
But he denied to have made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pressed for a transformation of the government ’ s lease arrangements.
A telephone record presented to the ICAC showed conversations in August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi, and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Ministry after working in the Fisheries Agency under Obeid.
“ Was the issue raised in these telephone conversations the elaboration of the commercial lease arrangements? ’ Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked.
“ No, Tripodi replied.
I cannot remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
According to official sources, Israeli fighter planes are attacking targets in Syria
Israeli fighters had attacked a destination in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a senior official to Fox News.
The civil servant did not explain what the objective was, but said that it was at least one thing.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on rocket deliveries to Syria.
Foreign workers with 47 visas could subject to ‘ authenticity tests
The government is considering an “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with a 47 visa as part of enhanced measures.
If the test were to be introduced, it would be used by means of a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for moving family and friends into Australia.
Today, a government discussion was published today after former Laboratory Party MPP, Maxine McKew, condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as an insult by Australia ’ s neighbors.
“ Loud statements like “ foreigners should stand back ” and “ Australians hire first, ” are a very unpleasant decline at a time when unions are demanding a protected labor market, ” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this has meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region heard echo of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures once envisaged by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who visited Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended amendments and the others are still under consideration.
If the ‘ criterion of authenticity ’ is adopted, someone applying for a visa could be checked to see whether ‘ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally linked to the holder or relevant person of the supporting company ’.
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 47-visa holders, in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers hiring hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker presumably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week by a refugee boat.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for for since his father ’ s death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes that high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England should be established from Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project ‘ will bring Britain closer together ’.
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown has said that he is very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed London to North England road from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and improvements in travel for the north of England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a three hours or less travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: ‘ Our objective for HS2 is a truly national network bringing Britain and its cities closer together ’.
We are leading HS2 because it brings enormous advantages.
Without it, we are facing a crisis of capacity in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented, “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland. ”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to “ unequivocal ” to Scotland ’ s integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said, “ The high-speed rail link has enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic power provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK. ”
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which will benefit everyone and complements the Glasgoow-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to looking at the report of inquiry with the British ministers next year and deciding together on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force for the time being in Australia.
Australian passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to ease such equipment regulations.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) enables US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read e-books, watch, or play videos on their equipment during critical flight phases if they are in “ flight mode. ”
Passengers are already allowed to do so during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books at take-off and landing.
Australian airlines are monitoring the decision that US airlines require an enormous amount of work to do to implement, but have no immediate plans to amend their rules.
The air traffic control authority, CASA, also stated that the announcement would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases still apply in Australia.
“ CASA does not currently have any specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft, ” has been announced.
The issue is subject by provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held discussions with CASA about extending the use of its WiFi entertainment system on flights and has said that it is open to change, but that these must be initiated by the legislature.
“ We would like to see a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience now that we offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight, ” one speaker said.
Qantas said that we would stick to the current rules for the time being.
“ Our current policy stipulate that electronic equipment may not be used at take-off and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that, ” the company said.
The FAA apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and we will certainly look carefully at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of the decision on US airlines varies according to the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference caused by mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and customer instruction.
“ After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any levels, ” FAA announced.
In rare cases when poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to switch off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seat or above the seats at take-off and landing.
Before the run-up against Schalke, BVB followers with lighacons had created ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced.
VfB Stuttgart have signed a new contract with VfB Stuttgart.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic that offered the viewer until shortly before the launch of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guest fans with their songs.
By contrast, the Southern Grandstand, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, was initially exceptionally quiet: no songs, no battghter calls.
The platform of Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common taxer, remained unfilled.
And at the front of the gallery there was a big flag labelled' section section on the prohibition on the stadium'.
Only as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, the first BVB player to enter the place did short rejoilation sparked.
When his team colleagues followed, there were loud vocals and bding scarves - but by no means everywhere.
Nothing worked in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the Southern Grandstand.
The stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a mood.
Only five minutes before the launch did the Capo climb his podium - and the hitherto almost palpable tension unleashed in a loud cry when thickles quesed the atmosphere on the slopes of the stadium as usual.
Finally, as always, it was the turn of the Southern Grandstand - and finally it was the loudest place in the stadium as usual.
And at the latest when the loud call a for " erbysieger stands up " came from the southern tribune, it was all the same again.
The silence before was probably a response to the events of recent days.
Immediately before vierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB fans had fired beacons into the auditators and onto the square - meeting almost goalkeepers Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was belatedly because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the top of the Ultras in Dortmund in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra tra Movement, " announced the BVB boss at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the ultras from choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.
'I have banned that,' he said.
We cannot abandon the policy of zero tolerance on pyrotechnics.
In addition, various ways of punishment have been shown to the ultras - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week.
" This will be significant, " insured.
We look forward to hearing what the reactions in the southern gallery will be.
Deposit Houses Booming in Singapore as the Crisis reaches the Middle-Class
In a deposit house in the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay her daughters ’ school fees.
“ My husband and I have just bought a house, there is all my money in it, ” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 Singapore (about €1,730) each month as an administrative worker and her husband works, monthly family income is insufficient, she explains.
Indeed, in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – demand is so high that ValueMax, where it exchanged it, became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore ean stock market this week.
Botdging jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhouses in Singapore demand an effective 17% annual interest rate, just above the 15.4% required by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, deposit houses have the advantage that there is no need for creditworthiness or proof of income, which means that loans are possible more quickly than from banks.
As a result, millions of people in the region turn to deposit homes as families feel the pressures of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit resulting from loose fiscal policies in the developed economies, families with lower and middle-income seek pledges to make up the difference in a faltering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
The Agency estimates that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to GDP.
Malaysia is at the top of the list, with 80% of GDP, with an increase of 60% as recently as 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and consumer demand.
“ In the final analysis, this means that as costs rise, people in the middle to lower segments (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible, ” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have exacerbated the trend to pledge of personal items, as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn the family ’ s jewellery into cash.
In Singapore, about 70% of the pledged items in the 200 deposit houses of the city state are gold.
People say, “ The price of gold looks good, let us mortdge grandmother ’ s gold chain, and bring it next month. ”
The largest Thai deposit house operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% increase in customers in its branches in recent months.
Growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it operates four houses – but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60% of Singapore ’ s $66 million this week with the Singapore IPO.
While some lenders have been on the fire over high interest rates, Yeah explains that deposit houses not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
“ Customers borrow items that they already own, and the liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase household debt, ” she explains.
The bond business is increasingly accepted by society as short-term, secure financing.
Nor are not all people who use deposit bonds in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax branches to mortgage gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the cash purchase price.
Customers from all social walks of life.
“ These include the wealthy who borrow for a business or investment in the short run, or small businesses that have to bridge cash flow bottlenecks, ” says Yeah.
Sometimes they need money very quickly.
NSA extracts data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence reciple Edward Snowden, has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clarify the increasingly sensitive NSA spay affair.
According to the presentation of Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence official would testify to a German public prosecutor's office or a committee of inquiry.
Snowden pointed out his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine " Panorama ".
Australia ’ s $325 Million Bailout Package for Tasmanian Health
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions associated with Australia ’ s $325 million Tasmanian health-care bailout to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic disease, and systemic constraints.
Funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanan Marian Andrew Wilkie.
“ The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe, addresses the unique challenges facing the state, ” said Plibersek today.
The $335 million package $31 million in emergency aid for electoral services.
A further 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract treatments, are intended to eliminate residues.
There is also money for dayday clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after in-patient stays, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of an electronic system for recording health data in local hospitals.
“ These investments are in line with the ideas that the clinics affected have told me are the best way to improve the Tasmanan health care system, ” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on the strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanan Government.
The state must maintain the current level of financing in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the extra money was spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if “ it were not accompanied by real reforms that would set the Tasmanan public health-care system on a more sustainable course. ”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to the request for urgent assistance, which he first made to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“ I am confident that federal aid will go a long way towards removing the state ’ s public health system off the list of worworries, ” said Wilkie.
According to the state government, these elections will largely compensate for recent cuts.
But the federal opposition spokesman, Peter Dutton, believes that today ’ s announcement is only a ‘ sticking solution ’.
“ We are in a position today because the laboratory government has withdrawn $430 million out of the health-care system, ” he told ABC TV.
It is not acceptable in which a state government pulls almost half a billion dollars out of the system and pock 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretend that this is good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.

According to one monitoring group, Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons
Syria has destroyed important chemical and gas gas munition manufacturing facilities, said to the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group, while serious collisions have occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances are alleged to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years ago since the start of the civil war.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of chemical Weapons (OPCW) came the day before the date
1 November, which the Hague based Organisation set up Damascus to destroy or make ‘ inoperational ’ all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to start destroying existing weapons and stocks.
It is assumed that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when battles were taking place in the city of Safira on Thursday, when experts say that there is a chemical weapons production facility and deposits there, as the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in the UK has said.
On Thursday, the activist group, which is following the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, declared that 120,296 people had died.
Of these 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged of President Bashar Assad ’ s army, with 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict 100,000 since March 2011.
This figure has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country.
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels Safira for weeks, many of whom have links with al-Qaeda groups.
The Centre said that there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not give any details.
The fighting underlines the danger to the chemical-weapons inspectors face, because their mission to free Syria from its poisonous arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, “ the team is now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria and witnessed their destruction. ”
As a result, “ no more inspection activities are planned. ”
Earlier this week, the inspectors declared that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of the sites identified by Damascus.
Because of safety concerns, it was not possible to visit two institutions, as the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPWC declared that the two sites had, according to Syrian, “ been abandoned … and that the objects of the chemical weapons programme there had been transferred to other institutions mentioned that had been inspected. ”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will have to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
‘ I salute the bravery and courage you have all shown in carrying out the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation, ” said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting Assad ’ s government and its security forces, of which include many members of the Alawites, to secession from Shia Islam in this civil war.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that a major explosion on Wednesday in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion, he explained.
Anger at Judgment for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted irritation at the verdict passed on the last of the instigators to be brought to justice because they believed that Umar Patek should be shot under civil law.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years when one of the sought-after people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bomb bing.
He could be dismissed after 15 years with penalties.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two night clubs in the popular Kuta tourist district, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many others injured.
A conviction was also convicted on a number of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The public prosecutor ’ s office had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man also known as the ‘ demolition man ’ because of his reputation as a masterly bomber.
The decision has evoused painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his fellow conspirators almost a decade ago.
Fighting with tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“ You should put him before a firing squad, ” said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when, on 12 October 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a massive bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded an explosisive backpack.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times while hanging on a life-support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas, and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the carnbath and were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy should be given the death penalty before anyone else.
Keep him alive – no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali bombers to be tried.
He escaped almost a decade of arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda Chairman Osama bin Laden barely four months later.
During the negotiation, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“ He didn ’ t stand, ” said Corteen.
Until recently, he showed no remorse for how much suffering he inflicted on other people.
The verdict was passed before the tenth anniversary of this year's attack, which is commemorative ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“ There will be tears this year, ” said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on aircraft (but not make mobile phone calls)
Passengers can now use their electronic equipment to reading, working, play, watch music and watch films from departure to landing, but not make their mobile calls, according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference how quickly they would be implemented depends on the airline.
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of air crew and the rules on storing equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from airlines to increase the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices, ” the FAA announced in a statement.
At present, passengers need to turn off smartphones, tablets and other appliances when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not take off until the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
Upon landing, passengers must switch them off again and must not retake them before the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the equipment at take-off, landing and rolling field, the FAA said.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted for the use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Association of Professional Flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
“ If the new regulation is implemented securely – and we are working closely with the airline on this – it will benefit both sides, ” Glading Glading.
Quite honestly, we are tired of having to feel like watchdogs on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data less than three kilometres were still prohibited, explained the authority.
Passengers are asked to smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still not a “ Words With Friends, ” the resembling Scrabble online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to shut off the device while the plane was parked at the boarding gate.
And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls will also remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices at take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones are still regarded as a risk.
“ Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disturbances in navigation devices, but also because we know from the FCC that aerial transmission can also disrupt transmitter poles, ” Rosenker says.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine this issue last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic equipment.
In recent years, the pressure has increased on the FAA to ease restrictions on use.
Critics like Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of equipment has become ubiquitous.
Some studies say that up to one third of passengers forget or ignore the device to be switched off.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air 1966 1966 after reports of disruptions in navigation and communications equipment caused by FM radios, which represented the latest technological trend at the time became revealed.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAA in such a way that they do not mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives, said Huerta.
Today ’ s electronic devices generally emit far less radio than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit minimal radiation when you roll over.
When downloading or sending data, however, however, the transfer values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the advocates of relaxing restrictions on passenger use of equipment.
In 2011, the company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-readers and took a test flight to identify problems, but were not able to identify anything.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk involved in using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the equipment disruption was real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee have said that there are only a few reports from pilots in favour of disrupting aircraft systems, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA that pilots should be allowed to order passengers to be switched off when landing under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travellers, who would now be fully equipped with technology.
“ We are pleased that FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety, ” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Vogel released by air rescue service from the North Sea drilling
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea dririg, was released back into nature.
The rally was flown to Aberdeen last month by helicopter, where it was thrown up by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA) in its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, the head of the center, said: “ This watertrap was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea. ”
It seems that the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling rig.
He added, “ He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help. ”
When she was released, the waterfall was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe ’ s elite ’ s elite to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy around the table and defining what those who provide wealth and work in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders asking them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives, representing roughly the UK ’ s corporate sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while states in the EU are stagnating.
They want the government to favour new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than engage in the long and arduous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
They believe that certain legal issues – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, because, according to companies, the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40% of the large companies, which are traditionally the most pro-European – agreed.
Finally, and this probably says most, our consultation of business leaders revealed that a clear majority wants Britain to take a course towards changing the agreement, and a trade-based relationship with the EU, not politics.
This insight, found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that will bring action back to Britain.
The stakes are high – changing the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16% change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate British terms for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation to see a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves toward closer economic and fiscal union.
Priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey shows, what means more attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
Construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom Board of Directors.
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream Gas Pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun, ” said Gazprom ’ s CEO Alexei Miller in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to increase diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia ’ s gas is stored in Europe, increases risk on conventional routes, as is heard from officials.
Miller said that the direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ forever. ”
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the whole project will come up and running in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries is due to commence on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline has an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff accused of charges against Jonathan Lord of sexual crimes
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged of sexual offences related to children before child carer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
But, in the opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA declared that “ the organization had never experienced an incident involving sexual child abuse. ”
Managing Director Phillip Hare was consulted about one case in which one YMCA employee was accused of committcrimes against child pornography and another in which a sports teacher from the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 of abusing children entrusted to him.
Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA ’ s opening declaration to the Commission was also imprecise in claiming that “ there had been external reviews of the YMCA recognizing the YMCA as at the forefront of child security. ”
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Hare, who began at the YMCA, admitted that the management had failed “ from me downwards ” to hire Lord ’ s recruitment, not ensuring that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety Guidelines.
Lord had been convicted earlier this year of sexual crimes against 12 boys during his two years for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lords regarding child safety.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, caring them privately as a babysitter, let them sit on his lap, said to one to one that he liked it, and let children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a training on child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior of Lords of the YMCA Caringingbah, was “ intimidating and very very remote for most of the time. ”
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report back to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord affected their judgment, which is why they had not reported him.
Hare explained that he had given the board of directors of the YMCA NSW ’ s view that the lesson to be learned from the “ Jonathan Lord incident ” was not reporting ” by employees, and the Board of Directors has agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations occurred was made by Liam Whitley, Managing Director of the YMCA ’ s children ’ s services.
He said that this was intended to prevent contamination of the evidence, which was ‘ overzealous ’ and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, told Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011.
He explained that there had been ‘ serious problems ’ in the recruitment, verification, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said that he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admitted that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old expressed his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as leader, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, mostly limiting his comments to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Quartet of peacemakers in the Middle East.
When asked whether he would like to return to office as prime minister, Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard as saying, “ Yes, certainly, but that is unlikely to happen, so... ”
When the horse dive experts gathered in droves in Cardiff to pick the horse of the year, they knew that there was a fierce competition.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The knee, which isn s not even in kindergarten and took its first steps only a few months ago, and his Shetland pony tee loosely trthrough the three laps and won first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of the same size, have been praised for their appearance, behaviour and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he put his hat in a naughty angle and led the two-year-old coffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which were far above its age.
And Toffee received top marks for his performance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has since been practicing with the Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “ Fenton and Toffee are a great couple. ”
They had to compete against the whole field of participants and left out of place with gold trophy and rosette.
This was only the second time that he had taken part in a competition with coffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Full foreigners in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Etiw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells told us, “ The entire audience was like electrified, and everyone fired and applauded him. ”
He ran on sand throughout the arena on sand and although he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
As it started, it will not be long before he is on the “ Horse of the Year ” show – and I am sure he will do well.
As one spokesman for the annual horse show said, “ Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony. ”
Together a great team.
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee on the basis of how well they had done and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They ensure good cooperation between pony and the guide – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fentons's sweet clothes played their part in making it really fit perfectly for the occasion.
The Chinese Newspaper for “ Reform ”
A Chinese newspaper that called on the front page for the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou New Express had printed a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a firm.
Now the New Express is undergoing “ comprehensive rectified, ” the regulator declared.
The “ Recitsation Order ” was issued by the Press and Publiclications, Radio, Film, and Television Authority in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the Neue Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“ The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly, ” the regulator announced in a statement.
She said that they had decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter licence ’.
In addition, “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to carry out a complete review of the Neue Express and recommended that the relevant persons be identified at the Neue Express and that the Neue Express management team immediately reviewed. ”
Chen had written several articles for the Neue Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and backed his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment.
“ In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence, ” he told the state news channel CCTV.
I did so primarily because I was looking for money and glory.
It has become clear to me that I have done the wrong thing.
Following Chen ’ s apology, the Neue Express published an apology on the front page, declaring that the reports had failed to be reviewed correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change at the beginning of the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing someone to accuse themselves.
Discovering Drug Tunnel with its own US-Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railways, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the tunnel measuring 120 x 90 centimettunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever found.
The tunnel, which runs a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, which makes it easier to hide drug-laden lorries.
According to the authorities, the tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unnoticed.
The discovery of the tunnel secured eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to the Court.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of owning and selling marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences of between ten years and life for a conviction.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the October marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses a challenge for the drug cartels how they can quickly bring their product to the consumer.
In 2010, authorities found a 640 metre long passage with rails from a kitchen in a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom commented about the separation from his wife, Topmodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric to be broadcast on Friday on Friday (local time), Bloom said, " life sometimes does not exactly as we plan or hope. "
Kerr and he still loved each other, the 36-year-old emphasized.
'We will support each other and love parents of Flynn'.
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
According to encyclopaedia, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it is very different from it.
While vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cakes, ice cream, or a strong Edam, these delicacies are not on a vegan menu.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the abandonment of meat and fish, the vegan discouring all animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one might wonder, but on closer examination, the vegan nutritional world is characterized by considerable imagination.
" Bread spreads are very popular, " explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, who offers a wide range of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native of New Zealand has been living vegan and in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live.
At the turn of the century the next step and I became a vegan.
" Conviction came not only from nutrition, but also from the choice of shoes, " says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realised that other everyday matters are also possible without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethics.
" I don't want animals to die for me, " Proctor says the maxim of vegans, which covers all consumption patterns.
Instead of mourning burgers, stirrers eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered new products and enthusiasm increased.
" It's a double bonus, " Proctor says today, " in fact, being vegan is not renunciation, not asceticism, but an enrichment. "
And it is precisely these conditions that made some well-intentioned attempts fail.
" The addiction factor is a decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking, " Proctor makes a comparison.
And applies:' Certain tastes cannot be tied to animals'.
It is often the spices or the way in which they are prepared that make the taste.
" You can create the same effect in other ways, " the vegan.
Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages.
He takes care of a balanced and varied diet, in which it should taste hearty.
Of course wants something between your teeth, that is legitimate.
" It should taste, but that is not just reduced to animal food, " says Proctor.
He had not suffered damage to health, including eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, there was a positive aspect to the changeover.
I do not absorb any foreign cholesterol and an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who only feed vegan.
" My blood values are excellent, I often check, " Proctor says.
Many critics of vegansim warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
" Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is doubtful whether the vitamin B12 content in the meat you buy in the chest of refrigerators is high, " Proctor says.
Vegans can also take the coenzyme tablets.
" My B12 values are fine, " he explains.
Processor for obtaining food does not have to go a long way to go.
After all, staple foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
Everything I need on the ground.
Only from time to time I buy something special.
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but that is also the case with " ordinary " finished products ".
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed.
" There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small tricks you can achieve good, if not in some cases, results, " says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of egg, and with his vegan cheese cake Proctor was also able to amaze his fathers-law.
The vegan lends a new spice.
This is dynamism if you cook together has a new significance.
" The situations that can arise are as diverse as the people themselves, " says Proctor.
Of course, he has already been skeptical.
Do you like my food anymore?
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk? " - on such questions you have to act as a sensitive vegan.
'I do not reject the people, I am part of that society', Proctor does not want an enclader to stay.
And more closely, the everyday world does not seem as vegalien as anticipated - and the vegan does not seem as restricted in everyday life as is commonly believed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are fries everywhere!
" Many döner shops offer Falafel, or even a vegetarian yufka, " says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he switches to pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants adapt so slowly.
" When I started feeding myself vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult, " the New Zealand can find a development: " You have to talk to people, make them aware of it ".
" If there are enough requests, they may be inclined to supplement the menu, " he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the Mannheim compartment or Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan meal on the menu.
Basically vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everybody can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
'Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,' Proctor notes.
" If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a sure way to make the majority impossible in the first place, " says Proctor.
purchasing vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially when one learns to understand that peanuts can also contain animal additives as colourers, one seems to be quickly leaving courage by following ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book " Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients added to food as well as cleaning products.
" Gradually you develop a scanner view and know which signs and logos you have to pay attention to " It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble, " Proctor knows.
Veganism is an important moral finger that beats consciousness.
He may not quite be able to get rid of his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically examine their habits.
Stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers on track.
Trading at Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued to operate unhindered.
The most recent incident perpetuates a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns in the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday had the Nasdaq indices not be calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two breakdowns in a week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs sent massive faulty orders to the option markets because of technical problems.
It then took stock exchange operators almost an entire day to review and cancel orders.
Two days later, half of all US stock trading stalled for several hours because of a computer breakdown at the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.
Last year, the Facebook IPO also caused a stir.
The Nasdaq systems were not able to withstand the flood of purchase and sale orders, later found the SEC, and imposed the company to a record fine of $10 million.
Konstanz: Cyclists drive 63-year olds.
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was using a women's bike unlawfully on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., on the left walk from the station square to the market place.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped on his walk from a restaurant, the cyclist, according to the police could no longer put the brakes on in time.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house, went to the ground and pulled a space wound about 15 centimetres on his head.
A rescue agency team took the injured person to the clinic for medical treatment.
British Police issue Assange an extradition notice
The British police today submitted an extradition notification to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard declared that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a “ invitation to face ” urging him to appear at a police station, added that if he does not comply, he would face arrest.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden for a sexual offence after its possibilities under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court refused to object to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he had sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has “ sent an invitation to a 40-year-old man to face a police station at any chosen time, ” one spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message commented on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States of possible espionage after posting more than 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks revelation website.
Drivers who had been ridden between his legs with 210 km / h and a hot drink will receive a penalty of £1,000.
A £1,000 penalty was fined for driving between his legs with up to 210 km / h and a hot drink.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on 27 May with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree.
After stopping by the police, they discovered the beverage cup between his legs.
Howie pledged himself guilty to the Colchester District Court without having taken the necessary diligence and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month ban.
Howie has also been sentenced to pay £90 and a £100 victim supplement.
Foreign Property Tax on London ’ s Spulative Bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who imposed a 7% stamp tax in the 2012 budget on housing costing over £2 million, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold housing as a company, not individuals.
Already, revenues from the stamp tax on housing in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which were £708 million in the 2010-13 tax year, exceed the combined revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, northwest, Yorkshire, and the Humber region.
As Cook said, “ After increasing the stamp tax on high-price homes and the introduction of legislation against circumvention, it is hard to claim that high-quality real estate is too low taxed, regardless of the impact of the outdated local tax system. ”
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant about buying real estate in London, or discouraging owners from selling, ” he added.
First-class real estate – the top 5-ten% of the housing market by price – in London ’ s wealthy Southwest belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has become more more expensive by a record-11.8% last year.
According to Savills, prices in Central London grew a steady rate of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by a rising “ domestic market ” in which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%), and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection between a dog ’ s swings and its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs waving the tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs it was the left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said, “ Man is well known that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions. ”
Here we tried to look at this for other species.
He also noticed that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the left movement, and vice versa, and that the two hemisphes played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the side angle of their fellow species, researchers supervised the animals while watched these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of four-legged and analyzed behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “ We have shown dogs films with dogs – either a faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we have been able to steer the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right. ”
When the animals saw an otherwise expressive dog moving the tail to the right (from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog that wander), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
He is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience which movements they should and should not worry about.
He said: “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and swaling with the tail in one direction is more linked to friendly behaviour and the right tends to produce less friendly behaviour, you react on the basis of these experiences. ”
Researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behaviour and guest Fellow at the Faculty of Veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and right when they are a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria in Canada said, “ Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog if his tail wings left, not right rather than restless – the other way around than in the Italian study. ”
According to him, the differences could come from the fact that, in the various studies the dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception, ” Bradshaw said.
However, since their behaviour can easily be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.

Pope Francis Apappoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis is appointed for the first time new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and it is they who elect a Pope, so that Francis will thus appoint the first group of men who will ultimately help elect his successor.
There are 201 cardinals.
But a cardinal reaching the age of 80 can no longer take part in the Pope ’ s election – that belongs to a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals. ”
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony for appointing the new cardinals, also known as consistency, was held.
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene consistency in February so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned, ” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals is likely to have fallen by February.
He declared that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinals eligible to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he likes.
Next year's consistency is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero says.
At the moment, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe, and Italy in particular.
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance, ” he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they have a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, established by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world charged with finding ways of reforming the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him, ” said Valero.
He said that it was “ perfectly possible ” for Francis to ask for advice from the cardinals.
So far, however, we have not been in this situation – all of this is completely new.
Valero said that bishops from large places were typically appointed to cardinals, but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we don ’ t know who he appoints. ”
GM recalls new pick-up pressures in the US to repair the seat backrest.
General Motors recalling alling nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup Trucks built in 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest, announced from the US Vehicle Safety Regulators on Friday.
On some of the cars there may be a defect in for resting the front seat rest mechanism.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines on vehicle safety for head restraints.
“ If the vehicle is driven from the behind, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury, ” was read in the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The models were manufactured between August 1st and September 10th.
Delivery of GM pressures began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed owners of the defect in the first half of October.
Due to the 16-day government Shutdown, NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased 20% in the first decade of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup Trucks.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4% to US $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Cry of Despair from an Obama electorate
I elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics.
Blocking does not apologize Obamacare ’ s website problems, the drone strikes
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what could have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I thought would cheer me up during the gloomy second year of my medical studies and give me hope.
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” and describes Barack Obama ’ s memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient records in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and take the breath away from speech.
The election became a landslide victory, and news spokesmen held to illustrate the historic significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on its way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office back in 2008, he had 82% approval ratings.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present again is a nasty awakening, like being torn out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Something has indeed changed in the years since I first voted.
But it is simply not a thing I could have imagined.
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from passing the Affordable Care Act on Health Insurance to military withdrawal from Iraq, ending the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army, and killing Osama bin Laden.
I agree that party political deadlock tactics have overturned too many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But, having defended the Obama administration countless against colleagues and acquaintances countless times, my attempts at explanation have come to an end.
I reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade cannot explain why they allow foreign leaders to interception or allow innocent children to be killed by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans, and why whistleblowers who expose government misconduct are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and spending are being circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report that states that the White House ’ s efforts to silence the media are the most ‘ aggressive … since the Nixon Government ’.
Recently, it cannot excuse the inability to create a simple website in more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I do not know whether that is what I should have expected.
Whether at the age of 18 should I have understood that the work of government could have contradict the political campaigns that preceded it?
Obviously, the office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate.
However, when I look at the examples given above, they seem to have been largely chosen by the government itself.
And that bothers me most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative; he seemed to be unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free of pressure from future elections, the hope we had heard about for so long.
But, as Obama ’ s approval ratings fall to less than 45% this week, this book has made its return to 2008 all the tougher.
It awakens me a desire for the many promises that have evaporated.
This week, I read a section in the book describing how Obama made a severe loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a meeting with the election workers following the decision, he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
" I want us to find our magic, " he said.
We must remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr President, and I could not agree more.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflicts in parental leave
The billionaire and deputy arian Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interests in his parental leave plans, because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from them.
The mining magnate, engaged in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in carbon tax, claimed when it wanted to dismiss questions as to whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important in deciding whether to cut or cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest, and that Abbott ’ s daughters would personally benefit from the law.
“ He is in a major conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets holidays, ” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of Fairfax ’ s Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes ahead of the recount.
Palmer called for a review of the counting process to speed it up.
Tony Abbotdaughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“ We need a better system, ” he said.
Why should we not have a system where you invade, enter data into a computer, vote immediately and then have the result at 6: 30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils ballot papers.
Do you use them because you can then wipe out the results if you do not like them?
It is unbelievable to vote with pencils these days.
The Electoral Commission examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new post “ very seriously ”.
A public office is about serving the public.
“ We don ’ t seek any reward other than history, namely that we can serve this community at a critical time, ” he said.
RBS Susends Two Forex Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is yet another indication that the global government investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is taking up rapidly.
Some of the world ’ s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities to investigate the world ’ s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes ownership daily.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation the libor interbank scandal.
The Bank, which did not commented on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from the authorities.
“ Our investigations into this issue continue and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators, ” the Bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation stated that RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and from a former trader to the UK Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is said to have been on holiday by his current position as European Head of Forex pot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was on holiday this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly chief currency distributor at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been accused of any wrongdoing.
Bankers at Barclays and Citigroup were part of Usher ’ s instant message group, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Finma, the Swiss regulator, declared that it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market by a number of Swiss banks.
At least six agencies worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are considering allegations that bankers have agreed in currency transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has roiled traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment banks ’ trading units in recent years, but has been under pressure this year, because low currency volatility constrains speculators ’ chances.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that, despite the enormous daily volume of forex trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and banks ’ use of banks ’ own internal platforms means that “ you can influence the market with very low ticket prices. ”
The news came out the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had cancelled a trader in her London Exchange Traded funds office this week after causing a loss of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed and informed and cooperated with the relevant authorities.
“ We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained, ” Credit Suisse said.
The fence on the Bechtland
A group of the citizens' initiative " Schweizer Wiese " embellished the fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
According to a press release, it also cleaned and widened the footpath.
The planned cover of the disintegrating house at the back of the property was not allowed for safety reasons, because the area is in danger of slipping.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed the beautification campaign with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the BI action, a banner had been put with the message' We are in favour'.
This did not bother ther the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Their motto on the big poster was' We are against construction ruins'.
In doing so, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss field - should the giant project one day fail.
In talking to many passers-by in front of the " construction site ", it became clear that some citizens believe that the realisation of the city's project would be better off for many, although quite a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city is delaying these answers, according to the BI.
As we have heard, the mayor's public statements also have an impact.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the end of the thermal baths if the public voted against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some therefore seem frightened, while others perceive it as a " crude attempt at blackmail " against the population, the BI press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for their color and helpers.
Rangnick Swallow King: Mana no Swallow King
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the " Bulls " was disappointed by the referees.
" There is currently a dangerous tendency to push Mane and Alan into the category of swallow kings, " he protected the two offensive at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest reason for Rannick's criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3: 0 against Val Gardena last Sunday, when the Senegalese was fatal alleged acting - but it was not, as the TV pictures showed.
" A glaring wrong decision, " Rangnick said, who called referee Harkam " completely overstretched. "
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Gröcoach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German compatriot:' I would have behaved in the same way as Roger Schmidt in each individual situation'.
After the skirmish with Hütter Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague.
I do not know why.
'I am the one insulted,' the 46-year-old stressed.
In view of the course of success, Rangnick received a chorus of praise.
'There are only two words: good,' he said.
There is not much wrong.
The way in which the team plays is impressive.
Let us continue.
There will be hardly any changes in the winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change.
" Except for a player, he approaches with the desire to leave the club, " Rangnick made clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s Health and Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court ruled today that the closely linked to Barack Obama was constitutional.
The judges ruled by five to four votes that the single mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a fine by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority.
Chief Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy chose.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 22,page law, and also argued that the Health Act ’ s requirement that states must either broaden the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise delete all state Medicaid subsidies was not unconstitutionally restrictive.
The legal proceedings had been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place turns itself with giant mirrors.
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their gloomy valley.
Due to the low level of sunshine, Rjukan in the Vestfjord Valley, usually sinks into the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at an height of 45 metres, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
" Finally! " mayor Steinar Bergsland swarming at the star ceremony on TV2.
Some dwellers of the valley moved around sunbeds, others put on sunglasses for safety reasons.
Until now, sun-hungry people have had to take a cable car to a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to channel the rays into the valley with mirrors.
This basic idea has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the project costs SEK 5 million (around EUR 615 000).
A similar structure has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine town of Viganella for several years.
Post Empties Sundays
" Many citizens will not have noticed that the red dots for Sunday slealing are still available at various post boxes in the city centre and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that emptying no longer takes place on Sundays and holidays, " says the FDP.
A question from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld are emptied.
Whether empties will take place in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sundays will not be answered in response to the German Free Democratic Party (FDP).
The spokesman of the German Free Democratic Party for social and youth policy, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to press here.
Sunday sleeve is an important postal service, especially in the case of appointment mail.
'Despite the price increase for letters on January 2013, this undertaking is fertilising it radically and unreasonable'.
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Group Group the the Liberal of Democrat and Reform Party, Democrat rat and Reform Party, supports his group colleague:' What annoys me is the fact that the empty times are being surreptitiously changed or even deleted'.
The post office is miles away from being close to the citizens.
" At least the post boxes in the districts Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied on Sundays, " says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
It also applies to the core city that especially non-mobile citizens, should also be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday shirts on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked the city parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post office on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post office had not communicated with Lampertheim.
To his knowledge, however, there is also a Sunday sleep in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out in favour of privatisation.
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere, " Maier said.
Frankfurt ’ s Parking charges Rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
This morning, the city's magistrate is discussing a proposal by traffic deducer Stefan Majer (Greens).
Consequently, parking charges are to be increased by 50%.
However, prices are not to be increased, but rather the time interval between parking watches and automatic machines are to be reduced from 30 minutes to 20 minutes.
The City Council will have to decide in December.
The Retail Committee of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry does not believe that this is' not a good idea'.
The parking parking right in front of the shop is " a major advantage for smaller dealers ".
The transport club in Germany believes that an increase after two decades is' quite appropriate and in fact long overdue'.
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
The City of Joy: Fast promotions by surprise
The lords I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb with a narrow cadre.
The elders stood on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
It soon became apparent, however, that they could not keep up with the rapid actions of the joyful cities, even because of their age.
The patrons found it extremely difficult with the hard and placed hlows.
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the middle of the network and were absent for block defence.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the joy cities in all respects.
In view of this overwhelming and g-determining performance, the third set was a bit lax and sluggishly to the 3: 0 end (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).
On November 2nd there will be a much more powerful opponent on the field, with the TV Baiersbronn, which clearly prevailed in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class the second teams from Baiersbronn and Joy City faced each other in the Murgtal Hall in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a fiercely competitive two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points, especially in accepting the ball; in passports, too, precision was sometimes in short supply, and in some critical game scenes, the overzealousness prevented the view of possible point gains.
In this performance-balanced encounter, however, Marcus Blasutto ’ s TSV team, the great physical dedication and a pleasant commitment of both teams was consistent.
Day at the Small English hut
On the meantime fifth day of care in the successor to the Natura 2000 project Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
On the basis of suggestions from the population, the view of the valley was to be opened in the area of the hut on this day, said mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the highlight of the canyon, where the landscape provides the ideal setting for wonderful views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that Care was a suitable instrument for strengthening the link between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set his own priorities.
At the same time, as the tourist aspect, the environmental aspect can also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Nature Conservation Department of the President of Freiburg following the welcome of Councillor Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the foresight coincides with the aim of preserving the old all-mendfield, which has now grown up, with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting it to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grass, cannot overcome forest barriers.
You need these free connections to preserve species.
Tribukait said that she did not want to stand up at this point for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure is not only seamlessly into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers an opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development based on the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous complementing what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous care days for the future.
After these various speeches, area manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been cleardown in advance and the forest tractor would be available if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of exempting juniper bushes and maintaining a dry stone bar.
The aim was a clear view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Still Only Candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the spa town of Löffingen, with its 7514 inhabitants, intact infrastructure, forward-looking policy towards education, children, youth and the elderly citizens, as well as its own municipal buildings, can be described as an attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet come forward.
So far, the 46-year-old bank merchant and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has been as the only candidate to succeed the mayor Norbert Brugger, who no longer longer a candidate for reasons of age.
The application deadline expires 6 p.m. on Monday, November 11th.
Google, Samsung, Huawei for Nortel patents
On Thursday, the group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, initiated an avalanche of patent infringement complaints against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company he outbid in Nortel insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought bought Nortel patents for US $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei, and four other companies for patent infringements before the US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that brings search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, such as the lawsuit that goes to the heart of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC, and HTC are manufacturing mobile phones that work with Google ’ s Android operating system, which is competing fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google placed an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times, offering $4.4 billion.
After being outbid in Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business partly motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
“ Although Google has failed to obtain the lawsuit patents at the auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so, ” the complaint says.
Rockstar claims a lot of compensation from Google for claiming that Google's patent infringement is deliberate, the charge says.
Egypt ’ s Sworn First Frefreely Elected Presidents
Mohamed Morsi is sworn in office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of Egypt ’ s political disputes.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt ” when he was sworn in as the country ’ s first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who had been expsted 16 months earlier.
Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago, with being inaugurated before the Supreme Constitutional Court.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court, dressed in black robes, based on the Nile and modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
“ We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic, ” said Morsi at the solemn ceremony that was broadcast live on state television.
“ Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy, and stability, ” said 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that, since its inception 84 years ago, had been sharply targeted as a banned organization by their government.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in the court to celebrate the new president, and, unlike the presidential splendour of the Mubarak era, traffic was stopped only briefly so that the car convoy could cross the usually busy road connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
As the Brotherhood ’ s uncharismatic “ substitute wheel, ” his personal prestige has grown since his victory and Friday speech, presenting himself not only as a candidate for the Islamists, but for all those who sought to target the efforts of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
“ Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state, ” explained Morsi dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he sworn in.
Later, Morsi travelled to Cairo University, where he was to give his inaugural address.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel playing the national anthem to which he listened in hapositions.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival he was greeted by hundreds of people present in the university ’ s largest auditorium with chants “ The Army and the people are one hand. ”
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970 ’ s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahire Square on Friday, the birthplace of the uprising that led the end last year of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule, and vowed to reclaim the presidential powers acquired by the Military Council from the ousted head of state.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not, as usual, before Parliament, he is bowing to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi ’ s Tahir Square speech was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberg Discotheque ensures two great evenings.
The new season in the Falkenberg disco " Blue Velvet " has started.
This Friday evening it will be " Pump this Party ", tomorrow Saturday evening it will continue with a double 25 party.
Big beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers crashed by Leader: Seriously injured
On Thursday, when changing a defective external senser, a 51-year-old worker crashed from a ladder in Eggelsberg and was seriously injured.
The man from lamp homs wanted to change a defective heating sensor on the exterior facade of an inn.
When he climbed onto the ladder facing the gutter, it slipped away and the man crashed onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the State Hospital Salzburg by rescue helicopter " Christophorus 6 ".
Rapists in South Africa: Twice Life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, perpetrator was sentenced on Friday to two life.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim later died as a result of serious injuries.
John Kana had been found guilty of crime at the beginning of the week.
The act had caused nationwide horror.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of young people was so appalling that the carers and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the trial that he had been in a bar with booysen night.
He also admitted that he had beaten and raped them, but he denied that he was responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The public prosecutor ’ s office also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost commonplace in South Africa: there are around 64 000 claims of sexual violence every year.
That is almost ten times as many as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has far more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
However, the police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the number of unreported cases in sexual violence to be between 10 and 25 times.

The speaker made it clear at the outset that the most important thing for ham is the pork beool, turbomast is not a good prerequisite for this.
Can ham in any supermarket be a quality product?
Jumbo, as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains the working methods of the company " Adler " in Bonndorf.
" Germany's favourite ham, " as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
It is only with hair protection and kittens that he get inside the factory.
Jumbo, too, must disinfect his hands before he can pick up the microphone.
Jumbo to strengthen fast food in Waldshut
" I am being worked with huge quantities, " is amazed by the television makers, the Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what quality matters.
Most pigs are slaughtered six months.
High level television?
Details such as the Ph-value of the meat are also important.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
" I am curious when you measure Roberto Blanco what happens, " Jumbo cynically said.
Here the level of private television in pure culture is presented.
But it is worth watching.
The spectator can see that disassembling the clubs is still a handmade.
Black Forest ham is traditionally found on the shelf without bones.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with salt.
Smoking tower and smoke fire are reminiscent Jumbo of a " submarine ".

You thought that travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and Great Britain.
The company now expects an adjusted annual pre-tax profit of between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to 315 million in its previous forecast.
Achieving the current targets will mean growth of 12-17% compared to a record gain of $290.4 million in the 2011-12 period.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre made 8% profit in the first half of the year and got off a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in Australian and British private business.
“ Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some are well on their way to record annual revenues before interest and taxes, ” he declared.
These include Australia and Great Britain, which are typically among our strongest results.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, providing for a slightly weaker business market.
Things were similarly good for the leisure activities of Flight Centre in the UK, while here, too, business customers spent less.
US business recovered compared to the weaker first half of the year due to the season, so a profit is expected for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre shares yesterday rose by 3 cents to $38.20.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar.
In courses on English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes “ unseen texts ” in order to encourage broader reading.
The combined course of English literature will be abolished.
From 2015 onwards, pupils will have to pass an independent GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education will publish the new English and mathematics curricula – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Supervisory Authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less course.
In a summer speech, Education Minister Michael Gove said that “ there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence, ” stressing that the GCSEs would become “ more challenging, ambitious, and rigorous. ”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours a year, or three hours a week per school year – than most other countries.
By contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore students receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to allocate more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math test, combined with a greater emphasis on the ranking profession – is likely to encourage schools to spend more hours.
The curriculum pays more attention to “ real life problems, ” including financial mathematics.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Talk Forum
The next Ecumenical Talk Forum on Monday, 21 October at the Neue Museum des Schloss will be on the topic " Zur Hölle mit der Hölle - Theological Überlegungen zur heute's handling with the letzten things ".
Speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Talk Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant communities of Salem, Salem Castle and the Bodensee Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to explore in the forum how people classify " last things " after death.
If people had known too much about this over the past centuries, relying on the images of heaven and hell that " shaped our ideas to this day, " contemporary prophetic doctrine of hopes of completion is characterised more by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
" The greater hope has been driven out by religious criticism, " says the speaker.
She has' provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost exclamation marks'.
Johanna Rahner continues:' But the crucial challenge remains the irritation of death'.
Related to this is the question of the desire " dreams that everything will be good in the end ".
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her Ph.D. in Dr. theol. in 1997, also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation in Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität in 2003.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has held a Department of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleiner Heuberg reaffirm their creed during the company.
101 15 and 16 year olths of the ministry unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been named in two services.
The service was accompanied by the Laudato-Si group in the morning, and the afternoon by The Spirit youth choir in the afternoon.
By receiving the FirChurch, the young people said' yes' to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous members of the community, the companies had prepared themselves for the great festival.
In various projects they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and experienced Youth Day in the Unterpowerchtal together.
Illmensee: Second Mountain Bike Race inspires participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the round course across the hills around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel from the organising sports club Illmensee informs this.
Among the participants, especially at a short distance of 15 km and 300 metres of altitude, were also numerous cyclists who wanted to practise their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders from the top German class also took part in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz recommended good positions at the German Championships.
These two were able to retreat from the field as expected.
As last year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advantage to the finish line and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was once again ranked in second place.
For the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare who made it at the top of the winning staircase.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Drivers from Owingen came in second and third place.
One welcome development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
It was not only in terms of performance that the whole range of athletes were represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 for the oldest starters.
The main race was even more absolute top athletes.
Four riders were able to set themselves apart from the top regional riders.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike professional from the blackpush racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, has already been the world champion in 12-hour driving twice.
This year he became the European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already owns two German championship titles in the duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, there was an eyelashes final in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes hall.
Pangerl was the first to rest across the finish line.
Only one second behind the routine Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall ranking.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann became third in the overall ranking.
In the women ’ s standings, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
Areane Blersch won second place from of forces from Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well organised running of the event.
On the way through mud, Rivers and Jungles for Free Medical Care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in West Africa, only one for 5,000
Vote here or with your mobile device.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the “ CNN Heroes of 2013 ”.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to vote the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 dollars to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital Cameroon.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation emerged that spread to his brain, causing a haematome that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, ” says Georges.
We would have taken it out of Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had.
“ It ’ s not easy, ” comments.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, but you are not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
In the United States, however, the ratio is a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroons could not afford to visit.
Two in the country ’ s five people live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country ’ s health-care expenditures are private.
“ The only problem they have is poverty, ” says.
And poverty makes life impossible to enjoy.
His father and so many of his compatriots suffer in Bwelle mature decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME that travels to rural areas at weekends free medical care.
Since 2008 he and his voluntary group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people forced themselves into minibuses and use the medical equipment on the roof across unpaved terrain to villages in need of help.
Not everything always goes smoothly.
On more than one occasion they have had to push vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like heroes: a feast, singing and dance, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care really really a reason for celebration and wave – with its broad smile and unlimited energy – happy to attend the happy celebration.
The next morning the team starts examining hundreds of patients.
“ We treat 500 people per journey, ” says.
You come from a 60 kilometre radius around the village – and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple local anaesthesia operations.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or an apartment; after the operation, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next person.
The lighting for the surgical and the disinfection equipment is powered by the group generator, so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours on Sunday.
It's a tiring, but village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“ They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work, ” Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work that has been done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference to the people it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a fracture he had received now allows him to work again.
“ The future of my family, ” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his charitable activities according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“ I really don ’ t know when he will sleep, ” says Katie O'Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and voluntearily collaborates in Bwell's group.
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organisation so that he can go on these campaigns.
This is an opportunity for medical students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
" We can be involved in operations where we help snap blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle, ” explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a second year medical student.
Students usually pay for themselves to Cameroon and bring frequently donated medical equipment.
Once in Yaoundé, however, Bwelle takes care of the accommodation, transport and guidance.
“ He is undoubtedly a hero, ” says O'Malley.
He dedicvotes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no bounds.
Almost permanent work is not a burden for Bwelle.
He is a great pleasure to help others a happier life, thereby fulfilling a promise he made to his father.
“ I ’ m so happy to do this job, ” says Bwelle.
And my father.
I hope he can see what I am doing.
I do it in order to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellent Fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel " The Old Man and the Sea ", is cut to the body of Horst Janson.
Janson is himself an old rabbit in his profession, acting art.
No one can fool the old man Santiago while fishing.
So the two simply complement each other magnificently.
It is almost thought you can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man mentioned by the fishing boy Manolo.
When Santiago sits on the chair tired of life, Janson is real that.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman through and through is a role that Janson has an excellent master.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man, who does not give up and who ultimately wins the fight against fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is largely on stage.
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that spectators forget that the sea is made up of blue bottles of water.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man operate in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he brings to light the active scene: the Santiago hut, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Favst, who sings Cuba ’ s feeling of life with her songs and her magnificent voice.
The four musicians play Cuba ’ s rhythm and are guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
A Roman sewage channel is preserved below Cologne at a length of about 120 metres.
If you visit Cologne, you cannot miss the Cathedral.
The two towers rise up about 157 metres, making it the second highest church building in Europe.
But few visitors admiring the two delicate church towers imagine that there is plenty to discover beneath the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for his guided tours is the service centre of Köln-Tourism directly at the cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacularly: " We start in the underground garage, " says Schulze.
In the seventies, the fathers of the city wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore only that was not too big stopped of the remains of the old city wall.
Most users of the multi-storey car park are now rushing past the Roman remains and park only their cars.
However, if you take a closer look, you will find an archaeological site separated by metal lattices in parking deck D2.
You can see ruins of about five metre high made of hand-sized stones.
" They are remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century BC, " says Schulze.
Before coming back to light, Schulze lets the participants on the upper level of the park take a look into a 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the preforium, where the participants descend again into the depths.
This is the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the CCAA Pector.
A visitor wants to know what CCAA means.
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ", which in English means " city Roman law and the city of the Agrippines, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the imperial cult ".
And the preforium is the former palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the hall of the exhibition an access to the tunnel leads to the Roman sewage channel, which is preserved here at about 120 metres in length.
" You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you like, " Schulze encourages the guests.
One surprise is that bowse still has a surprise.
After collecting the key at the box office, he leads the group to a 16 metre deep walkable shaft.
" We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath, " he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing.
To this day, at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different levels of water can be read through changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will become part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square, for which the construction work is due to start shortly.
However, it will take a few years before it is completed.
Banks almost chopped off: Repetition of the Rock Process
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is reopened after more than four years.
A trial has begun before the District Court of Frankfurt (Oder) for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and damage to property against two 30 olds.
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants remain silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rock scene and were among the bandidos at the time.
The public prosecutor's office accuses them, together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt, beat and beaten three men in one car in June 2009.
All victims were seriously injured a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group of Hells Angels.
One was allegedly a high-level member from Berlin.
It seems to be preceded by a pursuit of several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about area battles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it was impossible that the men were indeed involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice annulled the ruling after revision of the Public Prosecutor's Office and referred it back to the Regional Court for consideration.
One of the accused is currently in open for another offence.
The beginning, the main focus was the reconstruction of the procedures during the Tatnight.
The Commissioner investigating at the time was a witness.
The focus was on mobile conversations between the defendants and other intercepted by the police.
Difficult is that rockers almost always abide by - not testify - a law that suits them.
applies to the victims.
Only one of the victims unpacked in the first trial.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor's Office in Frankfurt (Oder) said on request that new traces have appeared since the last trial.

The Disable Society Not Think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it goes home.
The only thing is that hunger is felt in the bellies of the people on the front-passenger and back seats.
Of course, there may be the responsibility of some cocktails or sparkling champagne!
What could be more obvious than to drive to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a little bit?
I admit that I am happy to be me when it comes to getting fast food late or early in the morning.
A few chips, a cola, a burger - and then not like home and to bed!
But, on your way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gears are being felt.
After all, what should you miss by throwing your fast food bags out of the car window?
Especially at weekends, discarded paper bags are at the edge of the road and on parking spaces.
'Why?'.
Are the people too doof to take the bags home or to the next rubbish bin?
It is not just the case that the paper mill is spiling the landscape.
Bags have also already concealed transport facilities such as control barriers, thereby causing accidents.
But it does not think about what " disposable society ", probably it does not even know what that word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a backseat can look like after a spent nights: clothes, bottles and other rubbish run there.
A few bags would more or less make up - unlike the road, where no one wants to trample on the food remains of others.
I can already see the day coming when the towns and municipalities become stupid - and the fast food chains will have to demand deposits for their bags.
Obama ’ s Health Retdrawal
Yesterday, after strong criticism, President Obama backtracked on his oft-repeated, clear promise: “ If you like your health insurance, you can keep it. ”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurer a letter of dismissal, Republicans accused the president in recent days of deceived the American public.
Yesterday, Obama put his original promise into perspective.
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep it, ” he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports of dismissals, Obama asked Americans who received such communications to look in the free market for new insurance.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than forecast.
“ They are going to get a better offer, ” he said.
The government described it as hardly surprising that the 5% of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look for a different rate, because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“ I would like to say very directly to these Americans: they deserve better, ” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House of Representatives ’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, explained that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October.
“ I ’ m as frustrated and angry as anyone else, ” she said.
I am determined to regain.
This statement by angry Sebelius to an adviser behind her at yesterday ’ s House of Representatives hearing was launched after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long of Missouri over whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly urged ed to ask why the “ architect ” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to take out a HealthCare.gov tariff, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm the Attack on Syria ’ s Air Base
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous told the American news broadcaster CNN on Thursday that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air base in Latakia the day earlier.
According to CNN, the objective was' rockets and related equipment' which the Israeli Government feared had been destined for Lebanese Hezbollah.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab station Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been fired from Wednesday to Thursday and blamed the Israelis.
Channel 2, the Israeli television station showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, showing Russian S-125 Neva defence missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Insecure Jerusalem government has not officially confirmed the attack.
But the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli official as saying that he believes that Israel carried out the attack, but is not safe.
In any case, a spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said:' We are not commenting on these reports'.
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had previously, partly successfully, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a' red line' followed by a military response.
John Kerry declares in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has “ gone unduly too far. ”
John Kerry at an unexpected admission at a weakening of US resistance on its surveillance programs by saying that espionage “ gone unduly too far ” in certain cases.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was responsible with Barack Obama, for switched to “ autopilot ” when the whistle Edward Snowden ’ s explosive revelations about the NSA ’ s spying activities became public.
The leaked information has plunged the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
In a videogred speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said, “ There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as others in the government, learned of some things that happened by autopilot simply because there was the ability to do so, what dates back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to September 11. ”
He then was the first senior member of the US government to admit that US espionage had crossed a line, but also emphasized that no rights had been abused.
He said: ‘ In some cases this has gone unduly too far ’.
The President is determined to clarify matters and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one needs to feel that abuses are taking place.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be compromised in this process.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that many lives had been saved by its surveillance.
He added, “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves up. ”
There is radical extremism in the world intent on killing, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what would happen if we were able to intercept and stop it before it happened?
We have indeed prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have heard about such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to allay concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in counter-terrorism efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he has spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about their threats not to participate in anti-terrorist organisations because of frustration with monitoring by the National Security Agency.
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board in our joint efforts against terrorism, ” explained Murphy, first in the Senate as a democrat and serving as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger at the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, even though the head of the intelligence service this week said that the reports were incorrect and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited Snowden ’ s documents stating that the NSA had supervised German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended espionage on allies as necessary and declared that this was both sides.
In all this turmoil, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the Congressional visit, which is due to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members are due to be published in the next few days.
He said that the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some “ serious words. ”
He said that European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they themselves have used for years.
“ While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect Europeans ’ rights, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy, ” Murphy says.
Meanwhile, John Kerry faces a trip to the Middle East and Poland at the weekend to confront resentment about US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.

Australian Appeals against Prison in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for wrongly claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June of making a false statement after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning on Sunday 10 June, while two other men were holding her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had reached her hotel safely after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they admitted that they had imagined the story.
Until trial, she was in police custody on the ground.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-level detention centre on the edge of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player Ruby League League, who has approached the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra asking for help from his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the wellbeing of his daughter and wanted her back to Australia.
“ We are, of course, very concerned, but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible, ” Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the verdict and is at large against a bail of 50,000 Baht.
Australian reports have reported that in the meantime she is on holiday in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The Court has said that Bamford is represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent assassination of travel driver Michelle Smith in Phuket ket Thailand may try to improve its tarnished tourist image and thus to acquittal.
