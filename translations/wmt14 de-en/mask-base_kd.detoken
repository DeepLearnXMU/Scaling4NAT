Greater safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 metres apart: on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian lights at the village park were put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older town hall lights.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or shield?
Gutach's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
" The town hall amper was installed at the time because it ensures the way to school, " Eckert explained yesterday.
The traffic lights protect both cyclists and bus passengers and the inhabitants of the Bergle.
The plant, which was officially put into operation yesterday, is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße intersection.
We have the museum, two churches, the spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the ‘ Grub ’ residential area.
" With the high volume of traffic and pedestrians, another traffic light had to be used for their safety, " says Eckert.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Council.
" According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B 33, of which about 10% is heavy goods traffic, " stresses Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: " Safety is simply happening here, " says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, and a roundabout was also considered, however, because of the narrowness in the intersection Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße was discarded.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before when the traffic light masts were located: " By means of an extra loaded for us with particularly long logs strains, we tested whether these vehicles can leave from the Sulzbachweg to the B33 without having to turn the traffic lights ".
The traffic light itself, which costs around EUR 15,000, is " the most modern on the market today, " explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights can be easily seen by the drivers, for example even in the sun sun.
It is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lights per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
Press the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is open, the green comes directly for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can end.
" If a group or disabled people take over the streets, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will take the road safely, " explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver has to think along with this as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: as soon as the traffic lights showed green to pedestrians, an upper class vehicle smoked through - with a glowing red.
Josef Winkler has been writing the plight of his childhood and adolescence for more than 30 years.
The Carinthian poet has described the catastrophes of his Catholic village children - speechlessness, the pentendency towards brute violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and the lack of joy - many times.
The Büchner laureate is best known as a prose author, theatre texts are scarce in his work.
Collage from prose texts Gerhard Fresacher compposes a collage lage of prosate texts for his performance " Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze ", which can now be seen in garage X on St. Peter's Square.
The theatre maker, for example, combines elements from the autobiographical novel " The Serfs " (1987) with prosaminiships from " Leichnam, seine Familie " (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important proquity: a skwy sofa on which there is hints of copying and masturbating - the eight-person ensemble wanders through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little in the text.
The 70-minute performance overlooks the original with a wealth of directing traps, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
It is mainly the actresses who get to terms with the sometimes rather questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, immersed under water with their water, packed on the wall with their evening rods.
Forced into cellophans or moders, they stroke through the production on dangerously high sticks, either monologizing them loudly or lying completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly conveyed in this arduous way.
The evening has the best moments when singing - from Deep Purple to popular song.
It was only towards the end that the twisted performance came to some rest, and Winkler's almost absurd humor flashes.
A Blackbox in the Car?
US street planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying Highway system, believing they have found the solution in a small black box that can fit on the dashboard of each car.
The equipment that records every kilometre and reports information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to review the outdated system for financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertaries have allied themselves with environmental groups and call for the government to be able to use the small boxes to record the kilometres used – and perhaps where they have been driven – and then use the information to calculate tax decisions.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The United States Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But, while Congress cannot agree, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how, over the next ten years, they can switch to a system in which drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This really must for our country.
“ It ’ s nothing that we may use, ” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles taken with all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 onwards.
The way we pay will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the taxed Highway Trust Fund paid by Americans at the fuel column is bankrupt.
But America no longer has as much refuelling as it used to be.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The government oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to even one cent to raise the tax at high fuel prices.
“ The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable, ” says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile payment system.
“ This is the best alternative in the long run, ” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile based user fee.
Not surprisingly, urban liberals like the idea, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases.
California ’ s planners rely on the system to devise strategies to achieve the federal state ’ s ambitious climate change goals.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he sees this as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also impressed by the idea of having drivers pay after the distance they have travelled.
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole, ” explains Adrian Moore, Vice President for Guidelines at Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US Secretary of Transport who, in a 2011 report, called on Congress to move towards mileage reckoning.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project worth $10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented progress from being made, in response to the concerns of rural MEPs who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or the city in their daily lives.
Nevertheless, several states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed one is Oregon, who is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay mileage fees to the state instead of the petroleum tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois is testing it with lorries to a limited extent.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, motorists were sceptical about the idea that the government could follow any of its movements.
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem, ” explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
People did not.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into full surveillance equipment. ”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a series of states that are now looking for affordable technology to help the state capture the kilometers they travel, but not exactly when and where.
According to Khan, this would also reassure the public.
The hunt for this technology has led to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not originally set up to help states tax drivers.
Rather, their aim was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for motor insurance, with drivers paying on the basis of the miles taken.
But the devices she tested are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded, ” explained Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this.
In Oregon, planners experiment with giving drivers a variety of choices.
Choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any equipment at all and instead pay a lump-sum fee based on the average miles taken by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other places hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer ones.
In New York City, transport officials want to develop a tax device that can also pay parking fees, have to be paid only for kilometres kilometres, and speed data to be collected in real time from other vehicles that allow drivers to avoid congestion.
“ Drivers are motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system, ” says a city planning document.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder whether all the talk of paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for San Francisco Bay declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient, ” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission ’ s head of legislation and public affairs.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small Team Beats wiser
The Voluntary Fire Brigade handled its main test with flying colours, despite a lack of staff.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
In his assumption of practice, department commander Hans Kammerer chose the Feder estate in Burgberger Straße.
A short circuit was allegedly created during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and the smoking development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After Hans Kammerer ’ s first review of the situation, two respiratory carriers agreed to enter the building.
After a short period of time it was possible to find the first person and guide him outdoors.
The second person was worn.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow staircase to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
Then there were woodworking machines.
The first deletion attack was via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via an excess hydranten about 100 meters away.
Now it has been possible to design three deletion attacks.
A hollow tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer ’ s exercise was also about showing what can be done with few available staff.
In the event of an emergency, support will be provided via the Königsfeld Day Reaction Group.
The commander was satisfied with the workflow of the exercise.
Networking of Universities and Companies Important
During his visit to Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, the President of the National Parliament, Guido Wolf, was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt of where tomorrow ’ s force came from.
At the Hochschwarzwald Support Centre, he examined this important issue together with the Managing Directors of the School Directors of Vocational Schools as well as the District Gymnasium and the Chairman of the Parental Advisory Board.
" Education is an important location factor, " stressed Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project High Black Forest Education Centre.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation in the Wälderstadt between the Förderzentrum, the Kreisgymnasium and the vocational school centre.
He also praised the friendliness of the family in the district.
" It is important to look not only at the family phase, but also, due to demographic change, at the phase of caring for the care of relatives, " Wolf explained.
He also said that more and more employees were taking care of caring for and caring for their families.
" Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to employment, " Wolf said.
But nobody can afford to lose skilled workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the interconnection of universities and businesses.
" Those who have already got to know the benefits of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, are often preserved by the regional economy, which helps to strengthen the region, " the President of the European Parliament was convinced.
Only if sufficient apprenticeships were offered can the need for a skilled workforce also be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the south-west of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
On his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to develop local public transport.
'Persevere and ensure that public transport improves,' he said to the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music.
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the sencitizens of Dietingen to coffee, cake and then to a vesper.
In the past, the elderly people were in the resting place.
Meanwhile, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there were sausages.
Silvia Kimmichantle and her father Karl Kimmich talked to common melodies.
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old school to Kirchstraße, which is about to be renovated, should once again be placed on the renovation plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days leading up to the kiln, a small angle wall was installed in the first renovation of the front school school, to stabilize and static relieve of the more than one hundred year old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunling Urban Office, the further action provides for the involvement of the State Monument Office in the planning and the creation of a remediation concept for the old wall.
According to it, a calculation of costs is to be carried out by experts, which will then be put on the table of the local council to decide and determine how to proceed.
A decision on this is expected to be taken next year.
After the renovation, pavement and planting of the old interior of the school within the two side wings of the school built in 1912 in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure, the limitation wall wall that needs to be renovated has to be completely renovated and placed on a new structure.
The historic, hundred-year-old delimitation wall of the old school yard to the church road is in need of remediation and has a propensity to the ahead, mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not at risk of collapse at the moment.
A durable wall is a prerequisite for a school yard used by pupils, which was done by the current fastening works.
Originally, the refurbishment of school yards was even planned in 2008 / 2009, but high unplanned expenditure brought about a shift.
The National Monument Office will have a say in an important word in the historical renovation of the school wall, which has even been used for film footage.
If there are specifications from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes to receive subsidies from the conservalists.
Students of the Bräunling Primary School, who are now taught again in a well-renovated old school building with new Aula, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants jazz training in Stuttgart.
In the ongoing discussions about the future of the Musikhochschulen in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now also intervened.
" I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart, " said Özdemir the " Stuttgarter Nachrichten ".
Jazz and classical music go hand in hand at Stuttgart, Germany.
Özdemir, who is regarded as a favorite for a direct mandate at the federal elections on 22 September in Stuttgart, thus contradicts the Green Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, it is accelerating a reorganisation of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
Among other things, the degree programme in jazz and op is to be relocated from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
The US Border: discovers " super-tunnels " for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators have discovered and decommissioned a' super-tunnel' for drug smuggling.
As the US customs authorities announced, the more than 500 metre long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks, and an ventilation system.
Three suspects have therefore been arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine.
According to information, the tunnel had not yet been used.
" These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig through under the radar, " said Laura Duffy, the Attorney General of the US District Southern California, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where this had been discovered at an end of the tunnel.
Duffy addressed the drug gangs: " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money ".
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are constantly fighting against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77th 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug-related crime.
Constructed by Experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that it took about a year.
The track was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 metres into the depths to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres in height and 90 centimetres in width.
It would also have been a good way of promoting illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with cocaine.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, as officials have said.
Eight tunnels of this kind have been discovered since 2006, as the press conference in San Diego continued to say.
But this is the first time that cocaine has been found in such tunnel construction.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in small quantities and not through tunnels.
This is demonstrated by the " despair " of drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug investigation in San Diego.
They would do everything in their power to get to the United States.
No details of the detainees have been announced, at least one is Mexicans, they said.
They have to reckon with prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 ’ s Geisinger
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of 1250.
A return to the first mention of documents is approaching.
When the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks, the jubilee year is due to come.
Geisingen and church houses were first mentioned in documents in 794.
A document has been produced in churches in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there is to be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this kick-off event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned in 1250 years ago, in church houses.
On the occasion of the anniversary, a number of events are planned in Geisingen as well as in church houses.
Kirchen-Hausen will be held in July at a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July 1250.
Celebrating Celebration.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturdays and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festive weekend is also the Church Church Festival.
On the occasion of the anniversary, City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city, which will be performed on three dates.
On June 21 together with the Sunday celebrations of the Black Forest Association, on July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be ready and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is the last weekend of September, 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the violinist anniversary of the city, a new chronicle will also be released.
" But it should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen himself, but also a printed work about the viinsinging of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen, " says mayor Walter Hengstler.
Today ’ s viosinging is also celebrating its birthday in 2014; in 1974, today ’ s space with with uniunification was completed.
The new chronicle will be presented on November 21st or 22nd in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
But 2014 is another year with many anniversaries.
The Strohglonki Narrative Guild begins on February 8th with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60-year existence, the Gutmadingen harmony becomes 90 years old and the banquet on March 29th and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1st to 4th.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is getting 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at its new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in documents in a gift certificate owned by the St. Gallen Monastery in 764.
The document was produced in churches (Hausen), which was then a court place.
Both communities are mentioned in the same document.
The reason why this 1250 year-old should be celebrated in 2014 is, in addition, 40 years since there was the reform of the municipality.
Rail installations
Should the' Am Hirschen' railway crossing be extensively rebuilt in order to increase road safety?
Yes, local councils decided.
Schiltach must take EUR 220 000 into his own hands for this purpose.
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal next year.
In particular, the safety of railway crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions between trains and other vehicles throughout Germany.
If the communities agree to the restructuring, they will have to share one-third of the costs, while the rest are shared by the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach ’ s master builder, Roland Grießhaber, explained to the parish the peculiarities of the Bahcrossing “ Am Hirschen ”.
There, the city plans to build a structure at the height of the tunnel west of the railway track.
Even larger vehicles, such as those transporting longumber, could be in there without having to block the tracks.
Owners of Greece therefore suggested that a necessary support wall should be constructed in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was a controversial issue in the local council, as some councils questioned the need for road proliferation: Thomas Kipp summed up the critics' statement:' Do we have to take so much money into our hands for so few vehicles?'
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: the " Hirschen " railway crossing is regularly used for long wood transport.
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, Haas argued that the route served as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed.
As it is clear that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the' Am' Hirschen' railway crossing can also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to have an investigation into the costs of widening the roads.
Despite this, the reconstruction of the railway crossing was approved by a majority, provided that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city could extend the road in the direction of " Bahnhofstraße " to about 5.5 meters for encounter traffic if necessary.
The conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein, on the other hand, could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns access to the rapidly rising " Geroltzhäuser Weg ".
The administration had had the conversion plans of the railway examined by the engineering office Breinlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the connection of the Geroltzhaus weg would then be easily possible.
The study concluded that it could not be ruled out that the inclination of the road could lead to longer vehicles being seated.
Responsibility for this, in turn, rests with the city as a road load carrier.
The conversion can therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wood drainage and the turning worked in the current condition, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
At this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is also significantly lower than that of the other railway crossings, because right next to it is the stop in the middle, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main train station would have to be slowed down at this point that there was no risk of a collision.
A majority of people were refused consent to the reconstruction of this railway crossing because the city of Schiltach would have to " pay " the problem of vehicles present, the Councils said, as the railways could withdraw from responsibility once the construction work had been completed.
The panel considers the conversions at the " Vor Heubach " and " Vor Kuhbach " railway crossings, for which intersection agreements have already been reached by rail, to be unproblematic.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Far planets, gravitational waves or black holes - Experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they intend to launch in the coming years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, and five are still in the race.
Far away worlds.
Astronomers have found more than 1000 planets at other stars.
No one knows whether there are at least some of them.
It is difficult to choose: are we to search for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for earth-like planets and thus thus perhaps discover extratraterrestrial life?
These are the questions that those responsible for the European Space Agency, Esa, are asking.
For their Cosmic Vision programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that should make decisive progress in research.
The budget for such' L missions' is around EUR 1 billion each.
Start is expected in 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the European space research elite met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were under discussion, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Many bodies examine the proposals and hurt researchers.
A final decision is to be taken in the next few days by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions have been selected by Esa, to which the missions of the 2007 Cosmic Vision program will find answers.
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life?
The exact processes of the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the emergence of the planets surrounding these stars - are still in proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star possesses a planet, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In 2017, the space telescope " Cheops " is to be launched to investigate this issue, which will take a closer look at 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity.
The possibilities are limited, however, and Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, thus searching for " biomarkers ": gases considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This issue, too, should ultimately ultimately shed light on the preconditions for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field, as well as the particle radiation it emits with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined as an example.
With the " Solar Orbiter ", the Esa has already approved an M class mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is to start in 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in developing the solar system.
The Esa is the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision program.
The probe " Juice " (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reached Jupiter and would examine the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic universe physical laws?
Space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to examine whether the laws of nature that we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could show physicists the way to a new theory under whose umbrella all known laws of nature can be combined.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
Our cosmos were created by the big bang 13.7 billion years ago.
In addition to the familiar matter that consists of stars, planets, and creatures like us, there is dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and dark energy whose action accelerates the expansion of space.
So far, researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fraction of a second of the Big Bang, nor do they know what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With Euclid, the Esa has already approved an M mission, which is scheduled for launch in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn as to the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who Could Do the Race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will be left over at the end of the selection process.
In the opinion of many experts, the best chance of being approved as an L mission is " E-Lisa ", an ambitious concept for proving gravitational waves.
By this, physicists mean changes in the structure of spacetime, which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to date.
Elisa could, scientists behind the project hope.
The mission provides for one of two or three probes stationed in space.
In contrast to installations on Earth, it could also detect the gravitational waves that emerged during the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " to explore black holes, " Icy Planets ", another mission to the solar system's outer planets, " Prism ", a mission measuring cosmic background radiation, and the " Exoplanet Finder " to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
Proposals have already been made for sample transport from Mars, research into the moon, Venus and asteroids as well as solar physics.
Snowden willing to “ cooperate ” with US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistlelower of the US intelligence service, has declared that he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden presented to the media in Berlin by Ströbele on Friday, he writes: “ Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissent as a fialty alty and tries to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment that is not possible. ”
But to tell the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the international community ’ s support can convince the US government to drop charges against him.
The indictment brought by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Minister of the Interior, Hans-Peter Friedrich, told time online: ‘ If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German representatives, we find ways to make this possible ’.
US-Germany relations are burdened by claims that the NSA has tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member who chairs the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret services, said that one should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if this is possible, “ without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US. ”
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists when he visited Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee, Snowden, would not be able to return to Russia if he leaves the country.
When Snowden says in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there, says the MP.
Snowden explains in his letter that he would be exposed to a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that had driven him out of his homeland.
But he is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression. ”
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a credit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities “ once the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved. ”
Frontier Airlines charges charges for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to US $100 from passengers wishing to store hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand baggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if the announcement on Wednesday stated that passengers may keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, and small bags beneath the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier declared that you calculate $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 for passengers who only paid at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee is aimed at getting travelers to take care of payment beforehand.
“ We don ’ t want to calculate this sum, ” she explained.
In 2008, airlines began to charge for the first and second items of checked baggage.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore poed as much as possible into hand baggage, with the result that the compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are one way of persuading passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money.
It is about Frontier ’ s most loyal customers, who would have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take one piece of baggage with him free of charge at the boarding gate of a frontier, but the next person may have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of baggage.
O'Malley said that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they entered the boarding gate.
The new hand baggage fee from Frontier will only enter into force in the summer with no exact date.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines are happy to make use of them.
They argue that baggage transport cost money and passengers should pay this service if they wish.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover air travel after years of losses.
Most of them, however, have left the fingers of hand baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand baggage three years ago, and later followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost carrier.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional supplements.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that hand baggage charge Spirit generates $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who used to be a leader at Midwest Airlines, recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect from the gate if passengers were confronted with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage fee.
“ The boarding process was one of the smoest in my career in aviation, ” he said.
I awaited to see crackling of teeth and see palpable discussions at the boarding gate.
“ The airplane was full, ” he declared, “ and boarding was running like lubricated. ”
Frontier also follows the $2 required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice were allowed to keep the whole can and coffee would be refilled free of charge.
Water remains free of charge.
US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed this seven months later, after passengers complained and no other large company had been followed suit.
Frontiers step to charge for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to steer customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz between $10 and US $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to encourage passengers to buy directly from them, rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
Mileage was reduced to 25 per cent of the route on Wednesday.
A flight booked with a third party provider with Frontier over 1000 miles therefore brings only 250 miles for customers.
Passengers can also only reserve seats on the Frontier website when they buy directly.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The proceeds fell by 9 percent and flight capacity shrank by just under 13 percent in the first quarter, as stated in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get to grips with Frontier's finances as part of the sale of society.
Proverbials Coming from the Bible
More than 40 women visited the last women ’ s breakfast this year in the Protestant parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the Municipal House were " proverbials from the Bible " and " phrases from the Middle Ages ".
Zita, Zita Köhler, chairman of the church community council, addressed the biblical proverb in a lecture after breakfast.
" Proverbials contain life wisdom, regulations or warnings, " she explained.
She compared several proverbials to the Bible and explained their meaning.
She called proverbials like: wooden eyes are vigilant as scales fall off her eyes, keep an eye on someone, the Lord gives his own in sleep, wash his hands of them.
On several occasions, the speaker also advised their listeners what proverb they were.
The words from the Middle ges were used by the parish parish leader Christel Dehner: all good things are three, make blue, somewhat obscure.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called' bridges into the past'.
Finally a raffle was raffled.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before they were handed over to the winners.
Visitors to the breakfast round were also mixed with a candidate for the mayor, Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched on the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 men and women who are already working as unskilled people in the sector are to be qualified as skilled workers for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
" What is new is that the six-month courses end with diplomas, " said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are manifold: it would not make the participants unemployed, it would give companies trained professionals, who were increasingly absent in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
NSA declares that an “ internal error, ” not hacker, is to blame for the website ’ s crash.
The shadowy National Security Agency declared on late Friday that a bug had paralyzed its public website for several hours, not hackers, as was claimed online.
“ NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update, ” explained the spying agency in an e-mail message.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a denial of service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and is still not available to some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way compromised. ”
According to the speaker, secret information is not threatened.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to paralyze the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In the event of such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the target system's internal network.
Formerly super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency, is now in the bright light of the public and is strongly criticised of rerevelations in recent months about its extensive monitoring program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing intelligence controversy fueled initial speculation that today ’ s incident was the result of targeted cyperoperation.
The number of people without a job has fallen slightly by 22 to 1,307 in October.
Although the 3.1% quota is better than last year and also better than in September, " we would have hoped for more, " says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Agency for Employment in Sonthofen.
Many companies have reacted so far when it comes to hiring people.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is:' We hardly have any experts in the craft sector, in health care and in care for the elderly'.
Due to the seasonal period, job openings for staff in the hotel and catering industry have also been made again since September.
In the middle of December the winter season starts there.
The entire background report can be found in the Allgäuer display sheet from 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Loss of profit from Bombardier following a decrease in delivery numbers and orders
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% drop in net profit after coming under pressure from falling orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway sector.
Nor did Montreal based Bombardier publish any flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could be commercially in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago has so far been followed by only three more take-off, which makes it doubtful whether the test phase is proceeding as planned.
The results fell short of the forecasts and led to a fall of more than 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation from outperform on Thursday, given that the share has limited price potential in the next one or two quarters.
“ Although weaker delivery figures for aircraft were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector, ” Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft test programme progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and, after months of delays, flew for the first time in September.
So far, however, binding orders for the CSeries are 177 moderate, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see whether the company ’ s claims about fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new jet aircraft are correct.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and assurances from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the company ’ s management also insured analysts and the media that the programme was in the schedule.
“ The test aircraft has not stayed on the ground any longer than expected, ” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates have been scheduled during the aircraft ’ s service life.
Each manufacturer plans.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period, as we have done.
This is done throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, as the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts remain sceptical as to whether, 12 months after the maiden flight, the first customer will be able to operate a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier declared it will review commissioning planning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“ The slow progress of the flight test – though it obviously correspond to Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is postponed until the first quarter of 2015, ” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter, at the end of September 30, Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $147 million, or $8 cents per share of $172 million, or 9 cents per share the previous year.
The adjusted earnings per share remains 9 cents.
Sales fell slightly, from 4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims that it has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 to 26.
The order book in the aerospace division on 30 September was US $32.9 billion, unchanged compared to 31 December.
“ In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing, ” said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have increased by just under 11% to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport division on September 30 was $32.6 billion, slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the area of transport has been affected by settlement problems with some large contracts.
According to the company ’ s management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trading on Thursday, the Bombardier share fell by 8.5%, down from 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette would join the board.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10% drop in quarterly profits on Thursday.

Cocaine dependent lawyer, who warned drug boss against police investigation, must go to prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer was afraid that his clandestine drug addiction might come to light.
He was sentenced by Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation for fearing that his secret drug addiction might be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, hailed by criminals as a “ first-class, ” nicknamed “ Bash, ” was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police oversaw Scarborough, whom he advocated in a previous drugs case.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a meal at the bar.
Investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after tests had found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Over eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then supervised by the police as part of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after the police secured £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and £200,000 in cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be made public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was convicted and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court following a three-week trial on two charges for obstacles to justice.
He admitted cocaine ownership in an earlier survey.
The lawyer was convicted after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta ’ s house and putting drugs under the lawyer ’ dustbin with 60% purity in a black golf glove.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was in the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, brought the drugs, and then exchanged nine messages between the two.
In court, it became known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests discovered class A drugs in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but disped to take cocaine, saying that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that her discussion was subject to “ legal secrecy. ”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and took a hair sample.
In police interrogation, he claimed that he was running an office both at his private address and at work, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It became known in court that he had called important players in drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them.
As Public Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “ A criminal justice lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don ’ t break the law. ”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has become too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trader, but that of a drug trader who drugs in his lawyer.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the advocate of them.
But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He counteracted the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to carry out their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed ded any wrongdoing and claimed, “ If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I wouldn ’ t wait 15 hours, but would do so immediately. ”
But, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said, “ Mr Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the time he began to buy drugs from organized criminals. ”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him sensitive to the motives of leading members of organised crime who instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and must inspire confidence and confidence among the public.
Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the façade of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possing cocaine and judicial obstacles, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and should show that no one can escape the law.
We will find you and will take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of conspiracy trading in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drug-related offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160-year existence, the wreath of the song Dunningen will frame two services with Franz Schubert's " Deutsche Messe ".
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life ", which enthused the spectators in the spring of this year, at the end of the jubilee year the song wreath will enrich two services with performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary mass will be heard from 19 p.m. during the evening fair in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. at the service in the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Gesänge zur Feier des heilier der der Messe ", D 872, is a spiritual work of music by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The trade fair will be performed within the framework of the religious services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikassociation Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach – Skepticism gives way to growing confidence
For example, the 2015 parish council ’ s elections will make fundamental changes in the Haslach (SE) Soul Unit.
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
The basic decisions of the diocese can no longer be changed, and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear that skepticism about the new is hesitant, but increasingly confident.
The extremely constructive discussions between the six bodies and the main offices of the pastor team ranged from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to the concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish community council.
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained the newly defined guidelines for soul units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg with a presentation.
After that, as a church community, SE Haslach will henceforth form a body of public law entering the rights and obligations of the previously six individual church communities.
There will only be a common parish council and a board of trustees on which the priest force will be represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and in the six parishes so-called community teams are formed on the ground.
In the future, their task will be to promote ecclesiastical life in the area.
The question of the finances of the individual parish then showed that there was a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide for the preservation of accumulated credits in the parishes.
Liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the entire community.
There have been serious concerns about the major investments that have been planned, the commitment of which will then affect all parishes.
" In the past too, too, investment were made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone, " Haslach's relative chairman of the parish council, Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the Schutterwald-Neuried Seoral Unit.
They had set themselves the task in 2006,' to become one, five remain' and found that it was not so easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher unit then set out to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the local teams.
The papers will be fleshed out at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Seoral Unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is becoming more expensive.
The citizens of Pfullendorf must be prepared for higher costs of electricity.
As the Managing Director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDURURIER, a four-person Pfullendorfer family incur additional costs of between 70 and 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming increase in prices is the increase in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 cents to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This levy is set every year in October by the four operators of the large power lines.
These quantify the additional costs incurred by the reversal of energy, which they can charge above the price of electricity by means of a levy.
The Pfullendorf are the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even assumed a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before Stadtwerke could inform its customers of the exact price increase next week.
" We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x, " says Bias, with the number more close to the 2 cents.
The traffic light for Permanent Red: Pay attention to the Waiting Time.
Sometimes a traffic light simply does not turn into green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should we do - ride red?
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart-based lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad ".
However, the waiting time must be' appropriate', which can be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises you to stay for at least five minutes before the traffic lights are expected to function.
However, if you continue the journey in spite of red light, you must be aware that you are entirely to blame for an accident that it causes.
Whoever tolerates himself for less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes of continuous red, a driver had ignored the traffic lights and had to answer for a negligent breach of red light.
The traffic lights were not defective, but jumped over to the green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Local Council welcomes Sound Budget
Whenever local council sittings are about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well.
The municipal package in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known debt since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be a complete success in this respect.
This became clear when the 2012 annual accounts were presented.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget, at around EUR 7.6 million, was over EUR 1 million higher than planned.
The administrative budget surplus would also be around EUR 1 million above the approach, at around EUR 1.8 million.
It is mainly thanks to the surplus of higher business tax revenues and the local share of the income tax.
The asset budget was once again well above the planned levels.
It was EUR 2.5 million last year instead of the EUR 1.5 million.
" This is largely due to the higher intake from the administrative budget, " Rothmund says.
Since fewer investments have been made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the intake of savings has also been higher.
In total, the general reserve has been increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
" You don't just shake such a work out of your sleeves, " Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the local councils were visibly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that may soon be costing citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has been able to do without high rates in the past.
According to Gerster, however, this has often led to a reduction in subsidies from the country.
There are prerequisites for these subsidies from various sticks of compensation.
Among other things, the towns and communities applying for grants have certain rates of leverage.
" We need to look at the issue of leverage, because in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like to see subsidies, " Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Werter ’ s history at the male singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herer Festival, during which he was honored.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colours of his male singing club.
Even after 60 years he still enjoys singing with the meanwhile more than loving choir.
Wermter was also active in the association, among others for 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, pastoral speaker on behalf of the Cäcili Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him with a document from the Association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst, since the choir is also a church choir.
His colleagues in the singer presented him with the certificate of the German choral association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the award, the 31st autumn festival went as usual: with the MGV Betra, the song wreath Salzstetten, the Baisingen singer department and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had invited a colourful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which the approximately 400 visitors maintained.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like " Im Weinparadies " and " Lustig, ihr Brüder ".
They prepared their honorary singer Hubert Wermter a small confession - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's " Bundeslied ".
The male singing association Betra also sang classical choral songs such as " Jägerwerben " by Julius Wengert, " Weit, weit weg " by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song " When you pass through the valley ".
The song wreath Salzstetten, with its mixed choir and its women's group - the " impulchgate " - provided the festival's quota for women.
The mixed choir, with the Neapolitan popular of " Santa Lucia and " Eviva Espana ", took Antos Gus to foreign countries, while the " impulschor " also rested to foreign languages: " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " were part of their programme.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein returned to local locations with " Was isch der Schwob? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papper" Bierlied ", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - " Grandma Hanne " aka Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a casperl theatre and read a few stories that made the children busy about lunch.
Children ’ s Dreams come true

A jury of representatives of the Black Forest messenger, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selselect three wishes from all entries.
What are the prerequisites for participation?
The wish should be realised with building material worth a maximum of 2000 Euro and on a (promotional) day.
In addition, the winner himself will have to take care of many hard-working construction assistants.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus makes the material available with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenya ’ s press outraged by controversial media law
‘ We are in a frightening situation and one might ask: what is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow? ’ read in the newspaper that does not consider the draft law to be constitutional.
“ The law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it, ” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya ’ s most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased, because it is an extended government, ” and restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy.
‘ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament, ’ he said.
According to The Star, the new law is effectively strangling the media into “ the government, ” whereas The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered “ a severe blow, ” brbing the draft “ draconian. ”
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security in the aftermath of attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media aroused the wrath of the authorities for publishing pictures of security cameras showing the units sent to the scene of the crime allegedly robbing the luxurious shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to interrogation by hiring two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the invitation was withdrawn after an outcry from the media.
Under the new law, media houses can be punished by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists with up to one million and further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possessions of the parties concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “ a single punishment can bankrupt most radio stations. ”
Moreover, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on Kenya ’ s “ vibrant blogosphere. ”
If they silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they like with impunity.
“ Nobody will ever know, ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation, who calls the Kenyan media a decisive factor of control in public life.
“ Leaving politicians to themselves, bankrupt the country and take us back to the time of hunters and collectors, ” he commented.
Kenyan legislators have been inciting public anger in the past.
In May, they agreed to reverse the cutbacks ordered by the National Compensation Commission, and reinstated their hearty salaries of some 532,000 schillings per month tax-free – among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for the FC
Despite the cold weather and rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field did not lose because of the importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone probably wanted a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter didn't want to play a part.
So all those who came without an umbrella or were unable to keep one for any reason were lost out.
This was the case for the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as for many speakers.
That is why the FC chairman, Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of fulfilling a dream, also got wet.
His thanks were mainly due to mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the councillor, the companies involved and members of the association who were involved.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
Green pensioners laid 400 square metres of cobblestones for the new paths.
This remarkable volunteer was also honored by the member of the country ’ s parliament Karl Rombach.
Further greetings spoke for the Municipal Sports Committee, Hubert Baier, the Kuno Kayan, Chairman of the South Baden Football Association, and Friedrich Knorr of the Planning Office, who announced a donation to the club ’ s youth department.
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that recurrent weather-related influences in spring and autumn set the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played.
As early as 15 years ago, the first consideration was given to solving the problem, when consideration was given to building a third place at the football club grounds or at the real school on the Salinensee.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago, ideas arose about creating an artificial turf field, which was widely regarded as the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were started two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erblecht, pledged a share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and the country approved funding of EUR 104 000.
The Community Council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 in the total cost of EUR 560 000, summarised.
Construction of the 68 x 108 metre artificial turf began on 4 June.
During the period of more than three months of construction, 3000 cubic metres of earth were demolished, half of which were used to create a Dirt-Bike route.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with justice and home affairs.
The relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, parliamentary bribery and the federal police.
This morning, the working group on migration and integration also wanted to continue its deliberations.
One of the issues should be dual citizenship, on which both sides have opposing ideas.
The SPD wants to end the obligation for German-born immigrant children to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the Rules of Procedure this Friday, the SPD confirmed its opposition to a passenger car toll requested by the CSU.
The SPD negotiator, Florian Pronold, wrote to his group to say that a vignette is a' flat rate for multidriving and therefore ecologically counterproductive'.
There was a threat of evasion on country roads, which are already the focus of accidents.
Moreover, from Pronold's point of view, the introduction of a toll for all cars would only be a first step.
" There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date, " he said.

Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In future, announcements like this will no longer exist at Vienna Schwechat Airport.
A large proportion of the loudspeakers are thus eliminated - the noise level is to be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this novelty.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend by cessation of announcements concerning individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already renouncing the noisy calls.
The elimination of these announcements - on average, around 200 personal calls from the loudspeakers sound one day - is intended to be quieter at the airport.
" Experience has also shown that these individual announcements have been relatively poorly noticed, but at the same time all the other information on changed boarding tours or departure times is also lost a little lost here, " says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.

Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan nutrition requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
A purified tofu with a plant flag, for example, is a quarks replacement.
The Vegetarian Association also refers others to World Vegan Day on November 1st.
On the occasion of World VegantDay on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Association is proposing a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, and yoghurt allows it to be replaced by soya yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, oatmeal, almond or rice milk can be used.
Impact able plant flag replaces traditional whipped cream.
There are also herbal alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground linen seed plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable for this purpose.
Dough is instead with egg for example with a mixture of a teaspoon on baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
However, 50 grams of soya yoghurt or silk tofu can also serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800 000 people in Germany are currently eating vegan food, in other words, on a purely plant basis.
Sleep in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we started straight to Brooklyn Bridge, through which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
There was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which makes it a special attraction in the evening.
Due to the time shift, students were on their feet almost 24 hours, but true to the motto " The city does not sleep, " the day was decided in Times Square.
Despite shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by a ferry on the second day and climbed on foot.
Then we went to the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of 11 September.
On the third day, the pupils were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373 meter high viewing platform of the Empire-State-Building, while enjoying the view.
Afterwards, through the hustle and bustle of New York streets, it walked across Rockefeller Center to Central Park, an ideal opportunity to linger in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, students have arrived in their host families and experience everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated on the name day of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was said as a rather ruthless hunter, converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhornbläsergruppe of der Jagdreiter Westfalen, led by Brigitte Kluth, performplaying music for old, originally French melodies (natural horns in the mood Es).
The brass wear riding clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog bands on tow hunting.
The solemn trade fair will take place on Sunday, November 3rd, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed appearance shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and come back.
One that wants to name the program.
According to the encyclopaedia, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name on the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve within sight to the Rhine-Waal University, it does not have to stop at the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
After all, the aim of the cafe with its beautiful name is precisely to make a real stay not only in terms of thought, but also always to experience.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
A look at the interior at Opstrike 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The ultra-modern but not cool cafe ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team and the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top will spoil the guest with a wide variety of coffee or cocktails.
There are also delicious cakes or individually stocked fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, made a name for themselves as restaurants before the opening of the charming café at the Opschlag: in Kranenburg they ran the " Art Lounge ".
From the move to Kleve on the Opschlag, the likeable cafe lovers are hoping for more audiences.
Not least through the university.
" We do not have a specific target group, " stresses Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two here would like to address young students in the same way as senior citizens and all the ages in between.
Speaking of cafe lovers.
The likeable couple of owners are behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in a variety of variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Tis the cappuccino drinker.
" A baguette - that's my thing, " she tells the NRZ.
There were two events in the bright café.
Better to say.
After all, the Port Festival was likely to take place outside - Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring nature evening.
The two 33-year-old found " beautiful, successful and funny ".
But it is not everyone's business.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a real fan of event evenings for this reason: " You can't please everyone ".
And with an event I only talk to those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception here.
" We want to disrupt normal operation as little as possible ".
In other words, Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products on offer here, as well as with regard to the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which is increasingly becoming a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastronomic mile and thus the Café Déjà Vu.

A Day of Thank you to the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Festival of the foundation to which the MGV " Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker " had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had gladly come.
In the club restaurant of the restaurant " Witteborg " in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious coexistence of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the right festivity for honours.
This time Rolf Wagener was pleased with the special award " Singer of the Year ".
" Not only did you write a lot for us, but you also made some rounds for us, for our heartfelt thank you, " says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for taking part in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity quubs went this year to the choral director Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the honorary chairman, Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's " singer of the year " Friedrich Winkler each with 42 participants.

UN proclaims New Poverty Goals
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for Poverty Reduction announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in the evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “ Sustainable Development Goals ” to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expire in 2015.
They have been included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit this evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests. ”
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to undertake a process aimed at reconciling universal, sustainable development goals, ” he said.
“ These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by member states to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the Millennium Development Goals. ”
Even though the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four game days, the handball upper league still has a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves absolutely no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated.
However, I hope that we will finally win again.
" I don't know how such a victory tastes, " Malmon expects a sense of success from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn out trees, Malmon is raising the finger beforehand.
Many players were trained in A-youth.
That is why they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
" It also has to be seen whether there are any reinforcements from the first, " explains the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely improve compared to previous appearances.
Above all, there was a great deal of work, especially in the cover work and in the switch game.
Equal opportunities must definitely be improved.
So I hope that my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Mozambique security concerns are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputa, under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, to call for peace in a rare public demonstration.
“ We want peace again, we want stability, ” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt labelled ‘ We are asking for Security ’ in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital ’ s Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks now, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled rhodesia and then South Africa ’ s apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and natives.
Much for the fast-growing economy is at stake, because the discovery of vast coastal gas and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50 billion in investment in the coming years from firms like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelime Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on 17 October.
The assaults on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organisation of attacking soldiers.
President GuGuebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
On Wednesday, he told AFP, the French news agency, that Dhlakama considers himself to be a “ loser, ” who “ wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government. ”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo is abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously, ” said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
“ We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide heads, ” says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, pressing for electoral reform, has already said that it will boycott November ’ s local elections.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos electoral successes have shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – due to resign when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy.
“ He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency, ” says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has made worrying attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South link.
Most battles have taken place in the province of Sofala, which is a several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but which is home to Beira, the port used by mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale for exporting coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
“ Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique, ” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, slow progress in development, and a recent wave of kidnapping.
“ People think that the government and president are responsible for the country ’ s future, and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems, ” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstration, said people simply wanted stability.
“ Nobody is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again, ” he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ role models for life, ” according to one author.
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal power has no chance against clever tricks, ” and the art legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are “ far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools, ” which is why Crossley Holland advocated a “ careful selection ” of age-like works.
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are part of education in America, ” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic ” “ shut off ” children completely, because entertaining stories convey the messages “ subliminal. ”
Crossley Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Valley, said, “ You can have certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background, if possible. ”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy ending, but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil.
It must be subliminal, revealing history and not explain it.
That is the old story of showing rather than telling.
Hansjakob moves once again to Freihof.
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement company in Haslach, on Sunday his last years came to life in the " Freihof ".

Basketball: The Hope of the Neckar Giants Grows
The chances of remaining in the league of the Ludwigsburger Bundesliga's Bundesliga basketball baller have increased.
If there is a wildcard procedure, the Neckar giants will now have one competitor less.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers refrains from applying for a possible rear seat.
" We will not participate in the wildcard process, " said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting out the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
However, a first breathing a sigh of relief was not heard from Ludwigsburg.

Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum expect a varied holiday programme.

After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrill Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the stockpile.
The company has several iron in the fire at the site.
In addition to carglue mining, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind plant logistics.
The coal is shimmering in black on the storage site in front of the dike.
Two huge blue stockpile and backloading units distribute or load the coal here as required.
Every time the handling device is moved, a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
" The signals are safety and are required by law, " says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the event of unfavourable wind, this can be widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city order.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, the warning signals are now being kept quieter by means of technical measures.
It will continue to rely on open dialogue with its neighbours.
Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal glue mining for power plants and is one of the great companies in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the bathing tub in front of the terminal, which is extended to 18.5 metres, Capesize bulk carriers can be handled here for a long time.
" This year we want to crack the 3 million tonne mark in the envelope, " says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, imported coal goes to inland power stations.
Add to that the GDF Suez power plant, and a good 5 million tonnes of coal glue imports per year will be realistic.
The three loaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bavaria ’ s Basketball Baller, despite First Defeat
Even the first defeat in Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism of the basketball players of the FC Bayern Munich.
" Nobody can prohibit us from believing in winning against the best team in Europe over the past two years, " took by the Bavarian coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83: 88 (39: 47) on Thursday evening at title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their third appearance in the European premier class, the Munich players sold very well for a long time, but were simply not sufficiently clear in the decisive phases.
The guests first made the trick of turning a 15-point delay 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour before Piraeus turned the game around again.
" We fought back unbelievably against the twice Euroleague-Champion, but then made reckless mistakes again, " said Bavarian professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful singers of the Munich players who celebrated significant victories in the first two matches against the Italian champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, variable artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd jokes directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays Innovation has been expanded, as most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Foundated and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“ Most of these headliners began at Carolines and then became increasingly successful until they became known at some point to appear in a club, ” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival to continue to work with them.
This year ’ s event will feature performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “ Stand Up for Heroes ”, an annual music and comedy benefit event for army members in Madison Square Garden, with Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown up.
A number of the comedians who are taking part in this year ’ s festival have come to light through rather unconventional ways, such as shows on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic slippery fantasy football series The League on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast at both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series “ Marcel the Shell with Shoes On ”.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaumau Bell focused on racial issues) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival ’ s greatest magnets for visitors is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a TV show titled “ Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg ”.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in Manhattan.
“ The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry ’ s work, ” Steinberg said.
He has told me that when he is here, he sometimes goes through the alleyway between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, then perhaps I live here.
Iran satisfied with the Nuclear Negotiation Process
One week before the next nuclear meeting, Iran is satisfied with the five UN veto powers and Germany is satisfied with the negotiation process.
" After years, they now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years, " wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Sarif on his Facebook side.
There is still a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that a solution will eventually reach both sides.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill playcomrades with Machete
Two children admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they struck the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper El País on Thursday.
They would then have played football in a working-class district in front of their homes.
The corpse was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 km north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the youngest she had taken with her was to say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the course of the day before the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
The reason why the older person cited, among other things, a rivalry in the football match.
For the time being, he was admitted to a psychiatric youth institution.
Pamps Must to Prison
The Regional Court of Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison because of exploitative trafficking in human beings, pimpp, threat, insult and dangerous physical injury.
The former German military soldier, who worked as a door stand after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial agreement.
In five cases, therefore, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent on board after a few weeks against their will.
Resistance he used to break with force and threats.
He retained the income of women, some of whom paid for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he made contacts between women and the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
He had them partly monitored there in order to control their revenue.
In court, the accused initially claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert hinted at serious doubts about mental restraint and thus about reduced guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The Court no longer had to hear any of the women who were injured.
As one Crio official reported, following an initial notification, at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking in human beings have been identified by means of telephone surveillance.
The tapped talks were marked by great aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured parties would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness in which one of the women had discovered blue spots on the whole body had made no statement to date.
It is' a completely broken person' who considers violence and exploitation in this profession to be normal.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
" He broke away from these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after detention, " he said.
The price of oil continues to fall up to USD 96 a barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference variety for deliveries fell 14 cents in e-commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange in December late in the morning, to USD 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, causing prices to fall by 5.8% in October.
The large oil supply has strained prices in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy declared on Wednesday that US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But, on Friday, there was evidence of greater demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This suggests a continued recovery in China ’ s economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8% in the third quarter, after its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
crude oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil also used by US refineries, fell by 26 cents on the ICE Exchange in London to USD 108.58 a barrel.
The Court is blocking a decision on the NYPD ’ s Stop and Risk Directive
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Appeal in the US blocked the order of a judge who had called for changes to New York police department ’ s stop and crisis program (“ Stop and ” program, and exempted the judge from the case.
The 2nd US Court of Appeal declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a decision was taken on an appeal of the city.
The judge had judged in August that the city was in breach of the Constitution with the way in which the programme for stopping and questioning people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and remedies, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to help the police amend their policy and training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge must be exempt from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the semblance of partisanship, partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded responded to the Court ’ s criticism.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they unduly edly targeted black and Latin American men with the stop and crisis programme.
She appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy, training and service reforms, and ordered a pilot programme with body-borne cameras in neighbourhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people dismissed after police control.
An oral hearing on the vocation of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
A number of civil rights defenders have criticised the stop and risk tactics.
Such controls have been in place in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during non-partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg ’ s term in office rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men belonging to all minorities filed a complaint, which became a collective lawsuit.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop and risk program say that the changes will end unfair practices, create a more trustworthy and effective police force, and influence the way other police presidencies use the scheme.
Opponents believe that the changes will dampen police morality, not crime; nor will money be wasted and the broader problem will be solved by a police force that is under pressure after thousands of jobs have disappeared in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop and crisis practice, which is constitutional, but only reform the way in which the NYPD implemented the controls.
The Happiness of the Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels can reach.
With this Bedouin wisdom the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the story and fascination of the association " Helfende Hände ".
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which already has considerable success.
The first chairman, Mr Henne, reported extensively on the work of the association.
He himself was first in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed-Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations locally on several journeys.
During the speeches, pictures of the assignments were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the jubilee event could get an idea of the actions mentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association has also been shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne Henne, to act in an advisory role with the association.
In 2008, carpentry Schleeh from Baiersbronn built a sickbay in Socogim, a slums on the edge of the capital - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be nationalised.
There is a lot to learn in Africa as a doctor, according to Henne, for example, seding against burn-out.
The political unrest in the country has made it impossible to make as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to mirror in various areas.
In addition, containers with material are sent to Africa on a regular basis, such as medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March of this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty ant local colour by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, during their trip to Mauritania.
When his personal motives, he cited his work on auditing as a young Member of Parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a popular budget.
Fuchtel also emphasized that global economy also demands global human love.
It should also be borne in mind that Africa is closer than some people think.
Not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check tips.
Former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “ telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation ” in an attempt to confirm a false tip on an affair by then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in the Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special advisor ” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack and follow Pawlby's voice emails, but Coulson also called her and left messages as the court learned.
“ According to the public prosecutor ’ s office, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is not standing in front of people ’ s home and hopes to catch them for fresh action, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction, ” said Edis.
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate stories: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the monitoring, there is no other way.
What about the first?
Is he aware of the telephone hacking?
He denies that, but we say, “ And whether he knew. ”
Rumours of Clarke ’ s affair were first taken up by NotW ’ s feature editors, when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was said, “ Don ’ t waste your time, she is with Charles. ”
A volume of voicemails from their phone on at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire ’ s apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective ’ s computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects. ”
While the research was being carried out, Pawlby ’ s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, explained Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Pawlby ’ s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her with a voicemail with the following content: “ I have a story that we would like to issue tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles. ”
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important figures, such as former Minister of the Interior, David Blunkett.
The juries heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced a married woman because of an affair when he he had lifted with the fellow defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied to have conspired with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted telephone hacking.
Indeed, in protest against the planned wealth tax, French football will go through the first strike since 1972.
A mediation meeting comes to an end without results.
In the conflict over the Reich tax, the government and professional football in France have manoeuvred themselves into an impasse following a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of the association and associations at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and also listened to their complaints.
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75% income levy of more than €1 million per year that all firms in the country are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side, too, remained.
The strike announced at the end of November will now also be carried out, according to Jean-Pierre Louvel Chairman of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF).
The days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 scheduled for November 29th and December 2nd.
Gechingen: No absolute protection
" We want to involve the residents in the planning stage, " Mayor Jens HHler opened the civic information event as a flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to put forward ideas.
Häußler made it clear:' The final decisions are taken by the members of the local council'.
According to Häußler, the floods that hit Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009 were a major event that raised the question of protective measures for the future.
A river basin study was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood concept in Gechingen.
" The protection of as many cultivated cultivated plots as possible is the goal, " says Häußler.
According to the German weather service, the protection against a flood expected every 100 years is statistically the basis for the planning of the project.
Climate change is taken into account by means of a 15% surcharge.
In experts this is called " HQ 100aKlima ".
The water masses that had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 were in line with a 1000 year of flooding.
" There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement, " says Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros have to be invested in Gechingen, whereby the municipality can expect national subsidies of around 70 percent.
Häußler pointed out, however, that support can only be provided if an overall concept is implemented.
This requires the participation of the citizens of the community.
Expensive planning and authorisation procedures will have to be completed.
In the best case scenario, implementation can begin in 2016.
Amongst other things, the concept of protection presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheim Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood concept, participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Among other things, it was called into question why more dams and reservoirs were not planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal.
In addition, the most economical solution, according to Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe, is considered to be found.
There was resentment among residents of the resort, who repeatedly suffer from overload of the canal network even with normal thunderstorms.
The administrative problem is known and initial measures have already been taken.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for flood prevention, and that this should not be mixed up.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way as to handle two to three years of events.
dimensioning the sewage channels larger would devour millions.
Serious Pounded After Clash
In the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a head-on collision on the road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road, but could say little about the accident at first.
However, there are various testimonies that should first be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old steer of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman being so difficult to trap down that it took the fire brigade just under half an hour to free her from the wrek.
The real cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
Both accidents came to nearby hospitals.
The distance remained in a closed position for about two hours.
He could be called US Dostoevsky.
Philip K. Dick was a God seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and narratives also have something serial.
Amazing is the kinship on the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski, with his massive oeuvre, can be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who is something at home.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette distributes two thousand stories with two thousand stories.
Dick explains America - the realm of breath-taking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, securitarianism, and the belief that that has been chosen.
Dick had an experience of God, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, drugs had afflicted his brains.
He understood, early on, that the machines are divinity.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a human being from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That is the Blade Runner.

Master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The " Minority Report " dates back to 1956 and exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals.
The principle of' pre-crime',' pre-crime', is being developed here, in other words, what has become more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Thick's world, which is frighingly similar to ours, mutants are looking to the future - and the police are approaching.
" We grasp individuals who have not breached any law, " says the head of the authority.
'We grab them before they can commit a violent crime'.
And:' There are no serious criminals in our society, we have a criminal camp full of pesua criminals'.
They assume that bad is happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Thick narrative looks like the blueprint for anti-terrorist laws and the NSA's eavesdropping.
Anticipation of the attack: so does Obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice.
But Dick's story is not over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no longer any separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system.
It is perfect, but it is lying.
It invents its own preconditions.
Not only accept, but build on, errors and victims.
The system creates the danger it combats.
Reading Philip K. Dick means coming closer to the truth.
Testify for Merkel ’ s Late in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the late affair surrounding German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Bar could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, reported the agency Interfax.
Previously, Hans-Christian Greens Christian Ströbele, member of the Green Parliament, was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow to discuss the affair with him.
NSA revelations intensify corporate paranoia, owing to government surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On the orders of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism Control (BVT), the German Inestic Intelligence Service, he should photograph the roof of the US Foreign Post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German State Department in Berlin.
James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US did not use foreign espionage opportunities “ “ to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US firms so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profits. ”
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblowers employee, began publishing his pihorle of US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate bosses have no longer been sure whether they can take the director at their word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has spyed on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought corporate paranoia to a new high for government surveillance.
The camel ’ s back overcame the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone was interwoven, perhaps for a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then management are certainly potential objectives.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between the US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“ Germany must wake up, ” explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now poses almost as great a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to survey published by EY in July.
However, the documents sent by Snowden have not yet provided any evidence that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and that it should reduce its dependence on the US.
Businesses are sceptical.
It was proposed in the Bundestag that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
“ That is not how it works, ” says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If we had wanted a strong European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except for IT.
Yet the scope and technical subtlety of the US authorities exposed by the Snowden revelations have shocked firms that had previously seen the greatest risk of spying in China.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing, because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to the jurisdiction there and is therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after revelations about Prism ’ s US data mining activities, about 10% of non-based members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: “ We see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago – where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this legal area? ”
Many German business leaders argue that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that they must therefore be guarded at all costs.
Economic espionage is taking place as no surprise.
That has always been the case.
“ It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally as a result of the current discussion, ” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us at a commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate governance does not usually boast about the remedies being taken, because it benefits attackers.
For a long time, it has been suggested in large companies that it is not advisable to take a free USB stick at a trade fair or leave a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of directors of car manufacturer Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as eavesdropping.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid mobile phones will be thrown away afterwards.
But there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
“ Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, human resources and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorised access, ” the BVT warns in a report.
The US warns its own firms against espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in February the US National Intelligence Estimate ranked France, Russia, and Israel behind China in second place of the countries used to obtain hacking ’ s economic data.
A member of the board of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to industrial espionage, “ the French are the worst. ”
Bernard Squarcini, a former head of the French DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month: “ The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if working together in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies. ”
Hechingen: Fair answers Wedding Questions
" Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can make, " said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding ceremony can be held were now given by a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Represented were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: the retro look has returned.
This starts, for example, with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
The often ruiled and embroidery clothes are closed at the front, often with a veil, while at the back they go down their backs and often end in a tow.
However, as Stefanie Koch of the fashion house Kleidermüller emphasizes, the spirits divide.
In Gentlemen, the suit with waistcoat and Plastron dominates, but creamy or brown combinations can also be combinations.
Important is the selection of the location, has been explained.
The room was very small and the bathroom was very small.
Here the domain drew attention to their own offer in Remise.
If you want to take a horse-drawn carriage, Uwe Link has an offer.
" But carriages are also popular for young skin fgoodbys, " he says.
Romanticism is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more fashionable the " After-Wedding Photo " is coming into - i.e. recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, for example, a few days after the festival, but in wedding dresses, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sundays.
Flower arrangements, rings, wedding tables, cakes and also a wizard, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Don ’ t forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable feast.
Successful Dog Friends
Once again, the athletes of the dog lovers of Bitz were successful at a Rally-Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started with two dogs in Kandel; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner inner and won fifth place, and with the 15 month-old Marley he took it to 12th place with 87 points.
With her woody in class 1, Susi Höpp faced up to the referee ’ s critical look.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder.
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled Ringermat in the gymnasium of high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, explained the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a upright mat standing behind the grandstand in the hall of culture.
The sheriff of Lowndes County investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old ’ s family doubts it.
" They are convinced that their son was murdered, " explained Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson's lawyer to FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed that he had died as the sheriff concluded.
“ They believe that there is no logic in violating both the laws of physics and common sense, ” says Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being concealed in order to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son.
“ Her son went to school for learning and returned in a body bag, ” he comments.
US public prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into Johnson ’ s death, because a number of important questions remain unresolved.
What was the death?
Is his death a crime?
Moore explained at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, in whatever direction they lead.
My aim is to find out the truth.
“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation, ” he said.
Moore told reporters that initial autopsy meant that Johnson had died from a “ positional suffocation. ”
According to Moore, however, a second autopsy has given rise to a different cause of death.
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed, ” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into the death of Johnson, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of County Sheriff was not immediately ready to comment at our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities should release all monitoring videos that the investigators reviewed.
The teenager's parents said that they hoped that the video recordings would indicate how he died.
CDC Publish Allergic Policy for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for the handling of the food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the US government, as the number of schoolable children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has food allergy.
According to the CDC, spreading food allergies among children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools designed to raise awareness of food allergies in faculty and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrin in stock – the EpiPen auto injection is most commonly used – to counter a potentially deadly oversensitivity reaction.
State legislators have recently changed the rules to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrin in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with allergic reactions.
Children may say, “ It feels as if something is pressed on my tongue, ” “ My tongue feels as if a hair is lying on it, ” or “ My tongue is crabling. ”
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ Gender indefinite. ”
Germany is the first European nation where a third sex is recognised for children born with unclear genitals.
Newborn babies are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can indicate “ indeterminate ” or “ not specified ” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to relieve the pressure of parents not to have to make hasty decisions on sexually alallocation operations in newborn babies and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
An intersexual person said years later, according to the BBC, “ I am neither a man nor a woman. ”
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is born born neither as boys nor as girls every year.
They include intersexuals, a group diagnoby “ sexual differentiation disorder ” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Valais may have been intersexual.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise that the best available information on gender allocation be used if a provision is not possible, not wait for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding – if at all – on an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “ sounds like a good cause. ”
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“ Some people have life-threatening illnesses that require surgery, but most children do not, ” he said.
You can assign gender without an operation and then wait and see how identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity at all are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it is going to happen.
It is like the secret why people are homosexual.
A report in 2011 to the European Commission states that intersexual people are distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender--based, but is due to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defines defines both as one of them simultaneously or not clearly.
These characteristics have subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of discrimination against intersexual and transgender people in working life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Young people inconsistent with the gender now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female, or “ third sex ” on official documents.
In June, Australians Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the first “ genderless ” person in the world, after a court had granted the maintenance of “ unspecified ” gender status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German identity cards will henceforth have a third assignment in addition to M and W, X for intersexual.
Gender issues remain controversial in neighboring France, according to news on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “ gender theory ” from school books.
The US website Catholic Online has also opposed German law on the grounds that “ If the world is dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but not sexual activity, we will distort two more pillars of civilisation. ”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would find it better for babies to be assigned a sex at birth.
“ Being parents is stressful enough even without further restrictions, especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your own child, ” she said the parents ’ website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sex parts have been called hermaphrodits, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Only ten years ago, medicine regarded the sex as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But now that the ethical foundations of an operation are in doubt, now know how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex they are assigned.
“ In the mid-twentieth century, it was called a “ psychiatric emergency, ” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist who was called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about treating children with genitals, which is not clear, stems to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender was formable.
He coined the term “ gender identity, ” arguing that social and environmental impulses – how parents bring up a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones, thereby coining whether a person considered himself male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as “ John / Joan, ” his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off during a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and also remove his testicles and then bring him up as a girl.
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of transformation, which it was not, ” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he returned to the male sex and married a woman.
At the age of 38, however, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors practising this model.
But in the 1990 ’ s, when the Internet was introduced, survivors of these gender operations who are “ unhappy with the outcome ” came to light.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
Doctors were not clear whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after his birth in 1976, and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
“ I knew I was not a girl, ” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should be given a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he called for his medical files.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from produce enough testosterone to develop genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to the male identity, received injections of testosterone, and had his breasts removed.
The operation has made it infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worconcerned that German law could “ encourage stamp and stigmatisation. ”
“ Many activists are concerned that Germany ’ s decision might encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign “ unfixed ” to the child, ” she explained.
We fear that this favours intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sexes and then wait.
But we do not yet know what the effect of the law will be, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australia ’ s law, because “ it allows adults to be recognized as the third sex. ”
“ Adults should be able to make their own gender choices, ” she explained.
German law concerns allocation at birth.
This is not a fight that young children should be forced into at this stage.
When they grow up, they can decide on their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law “ empowers ” both parents and children.
Katie, daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Due to the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
It has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a employee of child psychiatry.
It is infertile, but hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or surrogate mother.
“ The law gives room to parents, so they do not rush to make decisions, ” said Baratz.
It gives them time to do different tests and sort things out, giving them time before writing “ male ” or “ female. ”
In this way, everything is fine – you pull the child big and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness.
And you do not have to rush to perform an operation that cannot be reversed.
“ This includes the children in the decision and removes the fear that is ites parents because they believe that they are not doing the right thing, ” she explained.
Ultimately, it is the child who decides on the sex that suits him better – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to decide for themselves.
Unknown Hurt Girls by Shooting a Car
Unknown injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when shooting from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired at a group of children with an air pressure weapon on Thursday evening.
That is what the police in Burg said.
The girl was slightly injured on the left.
Rescue took the girl to hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A slice broke down.
They then drove away from it.
The criminal police are investigating, they were told on Friday.
To date, the Police Inspection of Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were called only twice to be deworn children, throwing them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in good time and the remains of the eggs straight away, no material damage should have been caused.
Furthermore, some New Year ’ s Eve böllers have probably been lit in the city, but here too no material damage has been done.
A resident in the Bishop Friendship Trail reported that his car was wrapped with cloppaper and his cydar apertures were stolen.
Until the police arrived, however, the man all found his cydar flashagain in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to continue.
Living with Future
Actually Waltraud Ries lives.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of greenery, an old tree population, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
" Hopefully you are not afraid of spiders? " asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new flat for my husband and me for some time now.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider der phobia, but the concern that the many steps to the house and in the apartment can no longer be mastered in old age explains her.
Moreover, since a menisicus operation, the mid-fifty has experienced at first hand what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
She has recently published a book about' Living Happily in old age - Which form of living is best for me?'.
'Our flat is the best example of what is not possible in old age,' she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband more than 20 years ago to the duplex, it was simply a beautiful apartment surrounded by greenery.
Today, at the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
She also knows, however, that she is one of the few people to deal with the issue of housing in old age.
Most suppress it as long as possible.
Old will always be only the others,' she says she smiles.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great will we be concerned.
'Then it can be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for a self-determined living in old age.
" Which form of living you choose is an individual choice, " she explains.
D i e solution does not exist for the age.
Even those who can afford the old-age seat in Tuscany or Brittany should always think about falling ill.
And:' Without a good knowledge of the national language, one is also united in the Dolce Vita,' indicates the author of the trade book willing to emigrate.
Their models include classic support models, alternative forms of housing or the frequently cited pensioner WG.
In old age, everyone has their own ticks and flaws.
'For me, however, such a community would be nothing,' she says with a wink.
Certainly not like a student toilet with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age you simply need your retreat,' says Ries.
However, the author of the book does not want to rule out the fact that a living community can still work.
However, this must be different from the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want your peace and quiet,' she believes.
It is not alone in this opinion, at least in the capital of the country.
" Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own homes as long as they can, " is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civic service life at the age of the capital.
Your office advises people on the subject of getting older.
It is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation that older people in particular would often accept inconveniences and restrictions in order to be able to stay in their familiar environment.
Today there are many possibilities to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who are involved in the age-appropriate reconstruction of their house or home should get a thorough information first and not hire the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the age-appropriate reconstruction.
Even in the rental flat, one or two things can be realized, and if it is only the increase in the toilet seat, the interior designer clarifies matters.
But it is not always possible to transform the existing apartment according to its age and without barriers, no matter how beautiful it may be.
Waltraud Ries had this experience.
The room was very small and the bathroom was small.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she graes her more than in front of the spider at her home door.
Snowden wants to continue prosecuting
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence Edward Snowden.
He continues to be accused of passing on secret information.
So he has to face criminal proceedings in the US, said the US State Department spokesman Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Nor would recent Snowden statements change that.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Christian Ströbele appealed to the US not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele's statements are those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German member of the government.
In principle, secret service cabller Edward Snowden is ready for a meeting with the German authorities.
First of all, however, he wants his situation to be clarified.
The US-sought former NSA employee made this clear in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the federal lawyer.
After a Ströbele translation, the letter is written as follows:
To those responsible
I have been asked to write to you about your mass monitoring investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and used to be contracted or employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In working in these institutions, I have witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which led me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I have faced a serious and persistent incitement that has forced me to leave my family and my country.
I currently live in exile and I enjoy temporary asylum, which the Russian Federation grants me under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my policies, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations about a system of all-encompassing surveillance accountable to nobody to be a service to the public.
These espionage revelations produced many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence.
The benefits for society from these insights are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks accepted have been visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a fialty word and seeks to criminalise and accuse political expression.
Yet telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this harmful attitude.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and in accordance with the responsible clarification of the facts with regard to the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to a meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation has been clarified and thank you for your efforts to respect the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden bears witness to Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a Private Purchaser
" The building is in good hands, " says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality sold the former kindergarten in Gartenstraße to a private person.
At its most recent meeting, the local council agreed to the sale in the non-public part.
The building changed ownership at a " reasonable " price.
" The community is satisfied, " Maier.
The budget was EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner is going to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right to say that Winterlingen handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer had to pay for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, watching the garden and clearing the way kway.
" This effort is now gone, " says Maier.
Space Concerto at mid-summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a concert on the terrace of the Hammer Inn.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the clock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Approximately 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammricher musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the pieces of music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to cope successfully with the first music hock.
Report: Obama's Campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers secretly replaced Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 campaign, “ Double Down: Game Change 2012. ”
The Times has a copy of the upcoming book, and she reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had held “ extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether Obama ’ s dwindling hope of re-election looks better if he dropped bides.
According to Jonathan Martin, a Times national correspondent, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of the leaders of the campaign and the White House, notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact on the survey values of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded mystery within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley, Obama ’ s former campaign leader, Jim Messina, and former White House advisers, David Axelrod, and David Plouffe – knew about the planned chanof over.
Double down asserts that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange bids, despite their “ close, personal relationship, ” before finally opting against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances. ”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing biden with Clinton.
“ I said a lot of things to be considered, and that was one of them, ” Daley told the magazine.
It is important to remember that the president had terrible poll values at the time, so we thought, “ For God ’ s will, what are we doing? ”
While Daley described the investigations as “ due diligence, ” Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that considerable effort was made during the campaign to re-election to find out whether such a train pays off in respect of the ballot boxes.
“ Campaigns do not spend so much money on surveys and focus groups without thinking seriously about something, ” explained Martin on AC360.
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change of change.
Although Daley declared that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “ double down ” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political explorations had reached Obama ’ s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama was unaware of the research into whether to drop bides in the election.
“ Possible, ” Martin replied.
What happens to my email on the way?
E-mail is actually electronic.
Has the design of the Internet service e-mail technically implemented the technical recrecy of letters, as in the case of conventional postal services?
The main focus of the conception of the early Internet services was to make communication possible.
That is why the basic technical protocols have not failed to provide a solid foundation for audible correspondence.
As a result, a conventional e-mail is an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
When the user " Anna " sends a mail to " Benni ", are the computers of the two directly connected?
The e-mail program or browser of Anna sends the mail to her service provider's mail server in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMaMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider using Benni.
On the route, the mail can run via a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content from its provider.
Are conventional e-mails read on their way through the net?
Most of the mails are read several times on the way by software robots.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail has a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unsolicited spam mail that is immediately immediately or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do robots have another task?
On systems such as GMail, the robot also detects the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate by GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display the corresponding links to holiday offerings.
Also unknown people read the e-mails?
There is very little likelihood that unauthorised persons will read a mail.
However, this is possible in theory.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and the secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against reading?
An OpenPGP standard encryption can be used to encrypt an e-mail against reading.
With a lot of technical effort, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not easy to identify who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a study by Convios Consulting in August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had recently fallen, GMail was able to increase significantly from Gmail.
Mother Buried in the Forest and retired
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest and continued to collect their pensions and care allowances.
In order to be able to continue to collect a pension and care allowance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburburied his dead mother in the forest after an investigation by the police.
First of all, he covered up the deaths of the 89-year-olds, then he collected the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
As a result, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected as long ago as May: back then, it was striking that there were no longer any medicines for the dependent mother.
Investigators told the pensioner that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to ascertain it.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common flat for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, there was no evidence of capital crime.
Feel like ice cream that shines in the darkness?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first bright ice in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a shining treat.
He also came up with the idea after reading research into jellyfish and persuading Chinese scientists to produce the shining protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, raising the pH in the protein and triggering the luminaire.
Chris says that the ice cream responds to the warmth in your mouth and lights up – so the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, says, “ The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, so you get two grams of it for pounds 200. ”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH rises and the ice lights up.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to us to launch it in Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made, because the jellfish luminaire is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie ’ s Bristol based experimental company is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, ‘ I would like to develop invisible ice cream ’.
This is impossible in itself impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice creams, but I suspect we can find a way to do it.
The ice cream takes advantage of the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
After six days, the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League.
Right now, Ingo Ehlers ’ team will host the Derby against TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
This game starts the season for us.
" I hope that we finally have our heads free, " gives splers cautiously optimistic.
With the exception of the permanently wounded Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his complete cadre at his disposal.
Daverden, like us, also relies on tempo play.
We must therefore keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, we need to increase our coverage, which has recently left anything but a certain impression.
Daverden's Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we are far from favourite, because everything can always happen in the derby.
However, Panitz now wants to add to Morsum in order to start a series.
Missing will be Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this purpose, the young A Joost Windßuß, who is active in double play with the A-Youth Bundesliga player HC Bremen, is making his seasonal debut for this.
Whoever is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was small, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late, and disguise us for the neighborhood.
Today I have become a halloween potato.
Over the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home and I will probably not do so this year.
But according to the statistics, I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million, to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and decorations, according to the US ail Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
According to the NRF, costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year, irritating inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-punk space men will make it into the instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect nothing wrong with tradition.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my surprise, were not alone.
Indeed, according to the NRF, Americans are spending $330 million this year on their pet costumes.
These are a lot of ‘ hot dogs ’.
As for sweets, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, slips, candies and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Department of Commerce, who cross the neighborhood with the saying “ sweetness or sour. ”
Indeed, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and eat let us delude ourselves.
The only thing we do not want to consume is sugar-sweet Candy Corn, yet 15 million kilograms are sold around Halloween, the National Association of Conectionery Manufacturers.
That is about nine billion grains of corn.
It is a mystery that I have not been able to solve.
Nothing belongs to Halloween than houses in which it spits.
They have great names such as “ Terror Behind the Walls ” (which is in real prison), Howl-O cream, and The House of Shock.
Indeed, according to America Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized Spug houses in the United States that earn $500 million in revenue, including the wonderful photos you are ping into your trousers and then putting friends on Facebook, where you won ’ t get rid of them again, and then the guy you are on leaves a comment like “ nice facial pressure. ”
But let us finally move on to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and carving a pumpkin is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from a very young age.
Fortunately, the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend began only last year, thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving through the pumpkin, not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lamds, which slowly rotate into the front garden, probably come from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score points right, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something nice out of their 921 kilos of pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue workers carry charred corpses
The fire brigade had to leave on late Thursday evening in Helmbrechts.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire during the night.
The rescue services carry a charred corpse out of the house.
Rescue workers found a body in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrechts.
It is not yet clear whether they is a resident, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday evening it burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were beating out of a window.
The room was very small and the bathroom was very small.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor has been damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman.
For the time being, the building can no longer be inhabited.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first glance.
Germany ’ s largest state church has an offensive association to promote the profession of pastor.
The background to this is a possible shortage of parish: the Evangelic-Lutheran Church of Hanover expects the number of its currently 1,800 pastors to halve by 2030 according to the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the daily routine yourself.
For the first time, the state Church has commissioned a pastor with castles to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study theology after their baccalaureate.
Bures attribute this to the process of de-seception:' God's voice is quiet, the world is loud'.
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my calendar and I can set my priorities where it matters to me.
Pastors, as a pastor, could be very close to the people.
They earned as much as teachers and could make a living from them.
To be sure, more is paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer.
This is good for today ’ s young people, who are not only about a career, but also about meaningful work.
According to the Church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors currently retire each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a degree of theology begin their vicarials.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organise days of study for young people and also to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
It is even possible to become the President of the Federal Republic.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interiors include racing seats and six-point belts, as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with bowler work mechanics support and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains, “ Bowler ’ s rally customers have changed. ”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to open up this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the strain and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge offers a training and test day in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called to save a bitch that was stranded 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous rock promontory in a quarry.
Cockerspaniel-bitch Ruby had run away after a minor road accident.
Three days later, it was discovered by a walker in the quarry in its deplorable position.
Fire-fighters slept on the rock face and saved the dog from safe death.
The fire brigade succeeded in securing a bitch stuck in a rock wall on a 15-metre high promon.
The nine-month old Cockerspaniel-bitch Ruby had run away after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 to whom the dog belongs, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and thank the firemen of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately looked for their missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when she entered the quarry after the minor road accident.
Around 2: 15 pm on Wednesday, a walker carrying out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 metre high paragraph in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and seied to save Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, technical rescue team specialist, said, “ She was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the rock face – 15 meters from above and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff.
But now it is doing well.
She then eaten a few dog cakes.
This was quite unusual.
The fact that the dog has been discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said, “ Ruby had a huge accident. ”
There was a possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “ Watch rescue was frightening. ”
I could not even believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them poor again.
The veterinarian said that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have fallen.
The fire-fighters have done a great job.
What they did was really courageous.
We are simply so thankful and each of them was unbelievable.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “ We were afraid that it would fall down, but it remained at the top. ”
The firemen were great.
I find it hard to believe where it was.
Mick Jagger said he never performed Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she had worked as a background singer on Jagger ’ s 2004 song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said that she had had dinner with the alcker and that “ he accused me when I was 18. ”
She added, “ That was long ago and he was very nice to me. ”
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70, said that he “ categorically denies that he had ever made attempts to approach Katy Perry. ”
The representative added, “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the female singers who had a guest appearance during this year ’ s Rolling Stones tour.
Her new album “ Prism ” was immediately ranked in Number 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new story of independence.
This time, we are being warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the Hadrians Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the possible economic benefits of greater freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but as expected, this did not matter in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more convenient for them.
As Scotland is not a member of the Schengen area at the moment, continuing disregard Brussels would only be a small concession in exchange for what they really want from the Scots.
No story.
And one that has already come in the year that it resemblike a fossil: for the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project has officially died.
Parties across the EU that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a single currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Alternative Party for Germany – founded only this year – was able to win just under five million votes in September ’ s federal election, effectively evicing the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, is proving to be a turning point.
Many people believe that the European project has gone too far because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket into which the national economy is being coerced by adherence to the single currency.
The euro ’ s crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German policymakers would like.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, southern Europe will find itself at a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems, there is a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the “ green ” energy policies prescribed by Brussels – a code to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage, as we saw in Grangemouth.
All wage definitions in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being marginalised by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle that could keep Germany at bay and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, which is what the battered French economy is struggling with.
The result: Marine Le Pen ’ s more right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive re-election, putting the ruling socialists in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that right-wing divisions will automatically benefit the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among white working-class French?
It wants to use next year's EU elections to forge an anti-EU anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very well possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I would like to focus on: in the not-too-distant future, the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something of the “ Europe of (sovereign) nations ” that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may be sticking to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the United States.
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be in Atlantic rain alone.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the final analysis) Lesser England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suspect Scotland could do well in a looser European union if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably, the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a spectacular majority in 2011 by rejecting the proposed (and made) cuts for which Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the successive Tory Lib Dems coalition were responsible.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to have an austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing Up Quicker
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach adolescence rather than their white peers, as research shows.
Physical change does not mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that epidemic obesity triggers early puberty.
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grows breasts and hair at the age of seven or eight?
At this week ’ s annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is not a sign that puberty is taking place quickly, ” explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious indications of development, such as growing breasts, shame and armpit hair as well as body odors, appear in girls in the past.
However, there has only been a slight shift in the age of the menarche (occurrence of the first regular bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“ When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to reach Menarche, ” said Kaplowitz, also the author of the book “ Early Puberty in Girls: The essential guide on how to deal with this common problem ”.
Time is the most accurate test of how adolescence progresses.
It is controversial what is represents the beginning of puberty, but it is “ premature ” if breast enlargement is accompanied by a surge in growth before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
As things move faster, tests by an insironologist may be appropriate to eliminate serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments for delaying early menstruation and repelling another consequence: premature aging of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, speed of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication, but he admits: “ suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings, unlike being their peers. ”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side, ” said Kaplowitz.
“ It was a shock, ” remembers a woman whose daughter was given her days at ten.
Although there were initial signs and we talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came home with anxiety and excitement because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence of hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls, used to enter adolescence.
Kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the obesity epidemic.
He supported carrying out a 2001 study on girls aged between six and nine, which establishes a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that have played a role.
In that country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach adolescence rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations.
Globally, early adolescence seems to be influenced by all kinds of things, from economic conditions to the climate to the genes.
Another mystery: although boys of facial and shame are growing earlier, the trend towards a full previous puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other AAP conference doctors underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and shamhair is common even among babies and toddlers.
“ We must be careful about identifying the true beginning of puberty, ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“ This can mean you have to have a conversation earlier than expected before, ” advised Kaplowitz.
If calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than intended.
Jumbo manufacturers are arguing in the face of large orders for the width of seats.
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at this month ’ s Dubai Airshow.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those that are the most concerned by airlines – but this designated space is the key to the assertions of efficiency of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
This week, Airbus called for an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US arch-rival Boeing says that this is a matter for the airlines to decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-range and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
The shape of the back part of the aircraft – in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic results that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design is supposed to deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 777X ” comprises 406 people in seats in the tourist class that are more than 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus states that the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 people in 18 inches -wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often distribute blows about technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Now Airbus appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to compete with more than 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the start of a new war, showing donors with a picture of three people sitting in a restaurant, with the title: “ Would you accept that? ”
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in narrower seats than regional turbo props, ” says Airbus CEO John Leahy.
As dietary habits change, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970 ’ s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance travel, and by the end of the century, the average male American weight increased by 10% between 40 and 49, according to the US Department of Health.
According to US health statistics, the waist circumference of the average male American in the twenty-first century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival adheres to a 1950s seat concept, when the average body circumference of the freshly baptized Jet Set was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out that one additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increased sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing denies Airbus ’ figures on the size of the seats and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines strike the balance between air fares and facilities.
The company also explains that, according to research, the experience on the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“ It really does amount to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe they need in order to succeed, ” explains Boeing ’ s cabin expert Kent Craver.
They do not want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about greater elbows, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly becoming an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders estimated to be worth at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a significant impact on the US or European export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the layout of seats is the driving force behind the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 per cent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements about the results depend in part on comparing the 777X, with its ten seats per row, with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“ Boeing therefore squeezes more seats on its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products, ” KevKevin Keniston, Head of passenger comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row, with an existing 777s indicating that many passengers opted for a closer arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper fares.
“ Eighteen ininch width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that, from an economic point of view, the Airbus range is driven by the threat posed by the 777, ” says Mary Kirby, cabin expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world ’ s travelling jet sellers will even carry band measures to measure the facility in the competition.
Even if they praise the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with highly condensed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a ten-seater A350, but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of increasing cabin adaptability and offering wide seats in the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that calls for a new industry standard are likely to wout, but may distract attention from the wave of 777X sales.
The New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine could eradicate the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further tests are needed before testing on humans, which may take some years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good.
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help once millions of smokers who have tried to stop it, trying out all the methods available on the market, but have seen that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches, ” Cornell says.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information to produce nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver ’ s cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice given to nicotine maintained its normal level of activity.
By contrast, mice without vaccination would have taken a “ break, ” researchers declared, a sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if safe, could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thereby preventing nicotine addiction.
It is more likely, however, that smokers would use it to stop.
“ They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel a pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to remove their habit, ” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid.
The former Minister of the Laboratory Party, Joe Tripodi of New South Wales, is being investigated by the state corruption supervision.
The former NSW minister denies having changed the maritime lease rules at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who owned hidden interests in three properties on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Commission against Corruption) expanded its investigations into whether Obeid influenced various state ministers to extend Circular Quay lease contracts, where the Obeids ran two restaurants and one cafe, without tender for their expired in August 2005.
The charge is now being made that Tripodi knew Obeid ’ s covert interest in the land after Tripodi ’ s former deputy staff chief Lynne Ashpole testified on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pressed for public tenders for the lease contracts.
The tenants were opposed to this and also wanted longer running times.
In 2009, the Circular Quay lease contracts for companies that yielded $2.5 million annually to Obeids were extended without public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Port from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally advocated public tenders.
But he denied to making the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had urged a transformation of the government ’ s lease arrangements.
A telephone transcript submitted to the ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi, and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Ministry of Port after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Agency.
“ Was the issue raised in these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease arrangements? ” asked by Vice-President Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“ No, ” replied Tripodi.
I cannot remember what was discussed, but definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes attack targets in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter planes would have attacked a target in Syria ’ s port of Latakia on Thursday night, according by a senior government official to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the objective was, but said that it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457-visas could be subjected to “ tests of authenticity. ”
The government is considering an “ authenticity test ” for 47-visa foreign workers as part of expanded measures.
If the test were to be introduced, it would be used by means of a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door to move family and friends to Australia.
Today, a proposal for government discussion was published after the former Laboratory Party MP, Maxine McKew, condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers, which could be an insult by Australia ’ s neighbors.
“ Loud explanations like “ foreigners should stand at the back, ” and “ Australians hire first ” are a very unpleasant relapse in times when unions are calling for a protected labor market, ” told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region echoed this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for a discussion outlines twelve measures once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended amendments and the others are still under consideration.
If the ‘ criterion of authenticity ’ is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked in such a way that ‘ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally linked to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company ’.
Firms could also be obliged to account for the number of 445 visa holders after, in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum officer probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
The Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes that high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England should be established right from the start of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project will bring Britain closer together.
The Scottish Transport Minister, Keith Brown, has said that he is very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 is a new high-speed link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and the north of England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for the north of England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of travelling for three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: ‘ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together ’.
We are moving forward with HS2 because it has enormous advantages.
Without it, we are facing a rail capacity crisis.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented, “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland. ”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to work ‘ unequivocally ’ to promote Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said, “ The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK. ”
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which is of benefit to all and complements the Glasgo-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and adopting the next steps together.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain provisionally in force in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to turn off tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen the rules on such equipment.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch, or play e-books on their aircraft during critical flight phases, provided that they are in “ flight mode. ”
Passengers are already allowed during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books at take-off and landing.
Australian companies are monitoring the decision that US airlines have to do an enormous amount of work to implement, but do not have any immediate plans to amend their rules.
The air traffic control authority (CASA) also stated that the announcement would be looked at, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases continue to apply in Australia.
“ CASA currently has no specific rules regarding the use of electronic equipment on aircraft, ” has said.
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held discussions with CASA on extending the use of its WiFi entertainment system on flights, declaring that it is open to change, but that it must be initiated by the legislator.
“ We would welcome a review of CASA approval of electronic devices because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after offering (wireless entertainment) during the flight, ” said one speaker.
Qantas declared that they will abide by the current rules for the time being.
“ Our current guidelines require electronic equipment not to be used at take-off and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that, ” the company said.
FAA applies to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and we will certainly look carefully at the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
The decision has a different impact on US companies, depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate the radio disturbances caused by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs, and customer education.
“ After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers, and smartphones at any height, ” the FAA announced.
In rare cases in the event of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seat or above the seats at take-off and landing.
In front of the area against Schalke, BVB trailers with lighets had created ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced tough consequences.
VfB Stuttgart have signed a new contract with VfB Stuttgart for the Bundesliga.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic, which offered the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guest fans with their vocals have been heard.
The South Grandstand, on the other hand, where the most faial of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented itself extraordinarily quiet: no chants, no slaughter calls.
The pedestal of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common beginnings, remained vacant.
And at the front of the grandstand there was a big flag labelled " Section on the prohibition of stadium ".
Only when goalkeeper, Roman Weidenfeller, as always, was the first BVB player to enter the course, did short rejoice.
When his team colleagues followed, there were loud vocals and swinging scarves - but by no means everywhere.
There was no rain in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the Southern Grandstand.
The fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory victory victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a holiday mood.
It was only five minutes before the start that the Capo climbed his podium - and the hitherto almost tangible tension with hands eruped in a loud cry when Dickel asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium as usual.
As always, it was the turn of the Southern Grandstand - and finally it was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call for " Derby winner is coming up " came up from the Southern Grandstand, everything was as usual.
Silence was probably a response to the events of recent days.
Immediately before FC Schalke 04 returned, some of the BVB tratrailers fired beacles into the audience and onto the square - and almost goalkeeper hit Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the leaders of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement, " the BVB announced boss at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the ultras from a choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.
'I have banned from doing so,' he said.
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras have been shown various ways of punishing them - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will establish a sanction by the end of next week.
" This will be significant, " insured Watzke.
We can look forward to what the reactions will be in the southern gallery.
Pfandhäuser boomed in Singapore, as the middle-class crisis arrived
In a deposit house in the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exaps a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“ My husband and I have just bought a house, there is all my money in it, ” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earned 3,000 Singapore dollars (about €1,730) each month as an administrative worker, and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
Indeed, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it changed, became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pledging jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheaply as an unsafe bank loan.
Typically, deposit houses in Singapore demand an effective 17% annual interest rate just above the 15.4% required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, Pfandhäuser offer the advantage that there is no need to check creditworthiness or proof of income here, which means that loans can be made more quickly than with banks.
As a result, millions of people in the region turn to deposit houses as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit, owing to loose fiscal policies in developed economies, lower-and middle-income families are visiting up deposit houses, making up for the difference as the economy falates.
This week, the rating agency described Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly through rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
The Agency estimates that Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore have the highest household debt relative to GDP in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list, with 80% of GDP, an increase of 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a fall in consumer demand.
“ Ultimately, this means that as costs rise, middle-to-lower people (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible, ” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical gold price highs over the past two years have exacerbated the trend to pledge personal items, as people take the opportunity to turn the family ’ s jewellery into cash.
In Singapore, about 70% of the pledged items in the 200 deposit houses of the city state are gold.
People say, “ The price of gold looks good, let us pledge grandmother ’ s gold chain and bring it back next month. ”
EasyMoney, the largest Thai deposit house operator, has experienced 20% customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer subsidiary and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60% of Singapore ’ s $66 million that it went the Singapore IPO this week.
While some lenders got into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah declared that deposit houses would not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also would not directly increase debt.
“ Customers borrow items that they already own, and the liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase household debt, ” she explains.
The mortgage business is increasingly accepted in society as short-term, secured financing.
Nor are all people who use mortgage bonds in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all social strata come to us.
“ These include the wealthy who borrow something for a business or investment in the short run, or small businesses that have to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow, ” says Yeah.
Sometimes they need money very quickly.
NSA extracts data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service revelator Edward Snowden has a principled interest in helping Germany shed light on the increasingly sensitive NSA late affairs affair.
Following the presentation of Green MEP Hans-Christian Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia concerned the conditions under which the former intelligence officer would testify at a German Public Prosecutor's Office or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden has referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele has said to the ARD magazine " Panorama ".
Australia ’ s $325 million Tasmanic Health Bailouts
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions associated with Australia ’ s $325 million bailout of Tasmanic health package to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging island population, a higher rate of chronic diseases, and systemic restrictions.
Funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanan MEP Andrew Wilkie.
“ The government has put together an emergency rescue package that, in our view, will address the unique challenges facing the state, ” Plibersek said today.
The $32.5 million package includes $31 million in emergency electoral aid.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and grey star treatments, aim to eliminate residues.
There is also money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after stationary stays, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of an electronic recording system for health data in local hospitals.
“ These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic workers told me were the best way to improve the Tasmanic health system, ” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on the strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanic Government.
The state must maintain the current level of financing in order to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional money was spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that put Tasman ’ s public health-care system on a more sustainable course. ”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first made to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the list of worries, ” Wilkie said.
According to the state ’ s government, these electoral achievements will largely make up for the recent cuts.
But the opposition health spokesman, Peter Dutton, believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ pavement solution. ”
“ We are in today ’ s position because the laboratory government has taken $430 million out of the health system, ” he told ABC TV.
A state government cannot take nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and allow the Commonwealth to put 300 million into it and then pretend that this is good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package was spent on additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group.
Syria had destroyed important chemical weapons and grid gas munition facilities, declared the global chemical weapons monitoring group on Thursday, while major clashes took place in the north of the country near one of the sites where supposedly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had soon been killed three years ago since the onset of the civil war.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came the day before the date
1 November, set by the Damascus Organisation, based in The Hague, to destroy all chemical weapons facilities or make them ‘ inoperational ’, including all machines for mixing chemicals to toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to start destroying existing weapons and stocks.
It is suspected that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and sararine, a nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when fighting was taking place in the city of Safira on Thursday, when experts say that there is a chemical weapons and storage facility here, according to the UK based Syrian Human Rights Observatory.
The activist group persecuting the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria declared on Thursday that 120.296 people had died.
61,067 of them civilians, including 6,365 children.
By the government, 29,954 of them belonged of President Bashar Assad's army that 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in the conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
This figure has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced around two million people to flee the country.
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels for weeks for weeks, many of which have links with al-Qaeda groups.
The Centre said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fighting underscores the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its toxic arsenal of weapons is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team is “ now convinced that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria. ”
As a result, “ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment. ”
Earlier this week, the inspectors declared that they had completed the first round of reviews and that they had visited 21 out of 23 of the sites designated by Damascus.
The inspectors said that it was not possible to visit two facilities because of safety concerns.
On Thursday, OPWC declared that the two sites had, according to Syrian statements, “ been abandoned … and that the objects of the chemical weapons programme present there had been transferred to other named facilities that had been inspected. ”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will have to be approved by the OPWC ’ s Executive Committee next month.
“ I salute the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation, ” said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organization, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebals have been fighting a secession from Assad ’ s government and its security forces, to which many members of the Alawites belong, in this civil war.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there had been a major explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion unknown, he explained.
Wrath at Bali ’ s Judgment
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing 2002 reacted angry at the sentence of the last instigator to be brought to justice, because they believed Umar Patek should be shot dead.
Patek, who was one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia for almost ten years, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
With suspension, he could be dismissed after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many were injured.
A guilty dict has also been made on a number of terrority-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The Public Prosecutor ’ s Office had called for a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who is also called the “ Demolition Man ” for his reputation as a masterly bomber.
The decision aroused painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago.
Fighting with tears, Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“ He should be put before a firing squad, ” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not get any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when, on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a massive bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded an explosided backpack.
After the attack, he fell into the coma for a month and “ died ” three times while hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas, and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.
Indeed, this type should be given the death penalty before anyone else.
Keep him alive – no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek was the last Bali bomber to be tried.
He escaped almost a decade of arrest, but was eventually picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda Chairman Osama bin Laden barely four months later.
During the negotiations, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden to rebuild the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“ He didn ’ t stand up, ” Corteen said.
Until recently, he did not regret how much suffering he had inflicted on other people.
The verdict was delivered before the tenth anniversary of this year ’ s attack with commemorative ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“ There will be many tears, ” Corteen said.
Patek can appeal against him.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but not make mobile phone calls)
Passengers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music, and viewing movies from departure to landing, but not using a mobile phone, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
FAA staff Michael Huerta explained how quickly they would be implemented would depend on the airline in question.
The airlines must prove the FAA that aircraft are complying with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of flight crew and the rules for congestion in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA has stated that it has already received plans from a number of airlines to extend the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
These airlines included Delta and JetBlue.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon, ” the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, when the aircraft doors are closed, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices.
They are not allowed to take off again until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When they enter the landing, passengers must turn them off again and not take off again before the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic breakdowns could allow their passengers to use the equipment at take-off, landing and roll-box, said FAFAA.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted for use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
“ If the new regulation has been implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – it will benefit both sides, ” Glading commented.
Frankly, we are tired of having to feel like watching on this issue.
However, Internet connections for browsing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data for less than three kilometres remained banned, explained the authority.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still not not a Words With Friends, the Scrabble online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the aircraft was parked at the boarding gate.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, must continue to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile calls during the flight will also remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift the ban on certain take-off and landing electronic equipment.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones are still regarded as a risk.
“ Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disturbances in navigation devices, but also because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmitter poles, ” says Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to investigate this recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to ease restrictions on use.
Critics like Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of equipment has become ubiquitous.
Some studies have said that up to one third of passengers forgets or ignores the shutdown of the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 after reports of passer-carried FM radios of navigation and communications devices, the latest technology trend, had become known.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA in such a way that they do not mind electronic interference.
Airines have been providing Wi-Fi to passengers for several years when the height of the flight is reached.
The airplanes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives, said Huerta.
Today ’ s electronic devices generally emit less radio than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only give minimal radiation when you cycle.
However, when you download or send data, the transfer values are stronger.
In favor of loosening passenger usage restrictions, Amazon.com.
In 2011, employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that the disruption is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee have said that there are only a few reports from pilots in favour of disrupting aircraft systems by the equipment, most of which are very old.
However, the committee recommended to the FAA that pilots should be allowed to order passengers to shut down the equipment in the event of an instrument landing in poor visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would now be fully equipped with technology.
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety, ” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Birds rescued by air rescue service from the North Sea Drilling Island
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea rig, was released back into nature.
The water rally was flown last month to Aberdeen by helicopter, where it was papped by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said, “ This waterfall was probably a winter migration bird from northern Europe, stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea. ”
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the rig.
He added, “ He could no longer fly any further, so we were contacted with the request for help. ”
When they were released, the water rally was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe ’ s elite willing to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy around the table and defining what those who provide wealth and work in Britain want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders asking them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov consulted more than 1,000 business executives who roughly reflect Britain ’ s sizes, sectors, and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow while states in the EU are stagnating.
They want the government to favor new trade ties with countries like China, India, and Brazil, rather than bogging down on the long and strenduous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
They believe that certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be recback to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, because, according to businesses, the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40% of the large companies that have traditionally been most pro-European.
Finally, and this probably says most, our consultation of business leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and a trade relationship with the EU, not politics.
This realization, which is found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings action back to Britain.
The stakes are high – changing the agreement and improving the conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum at 16%.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate Britain ’ s conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves toward closer economic and fiscal union.
Pripriority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey show, which means greater attention for businesses to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom Board.
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone: construction on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun, ” said Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the whole of the European continent.
South Stream is to increase diversity in Russia ’ s European export routes.
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe, provides an increased risk on conventional routes, as officials say.
Miller said that the direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries had been ‘ forever ’ eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates if the whole project is up and running in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries is to begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: two YMCA employees accused of charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual crimes
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual crimes related to children before charges were made against child carer Jonathan Lord out of Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
However, when the declaration was opened to the Commission, the YMCA declared that ‘ the organisation had never had to deal with an incident of child sexual abuse ’.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which one YMCA employee had been accused of child pornography and another in which one sports teacher from the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of abusing children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA ’ s declaration of opening to the Commission was also imprecise in claiming that ‘ there had been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety ’.
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management had failed “ downwards from me on ” to recruit Lord, and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report breaches of child safety policies.
Lord was convicted at the beginning of the year of sexual crimes against 12 boys during his two years of work for the YMCA.
He has been sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, argued that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that had prevented employees from reporting Lord ’ s violations of children ’ s safety.
The staff said that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, looked after them privately as a babysitter, let them sit on his lap, said that he liked it, and let children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord, who had asked for training on child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that children ’ s service director Jacqui Barnat, who was the superiLords in the YMCA Caringbah, was “ very intimidating and very close to most of the time. ”
The CEO said that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord has diminished their judgement, which is why they would not have reported him.
Hare explained that he had informed the Board of directors of the YMCA NSW of his view that the lesson that the organization should learn from the Jonathan Lord incident incident “ does not concern reporting ” by employees, and the Board of Directors had agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations had occurred was made by Liam Whitley, CEO of the YMCA ’ s children ’ s services.
He said that this would prevent contamination of the evidence, but it had been ‘ overzealous ’ and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not an organization safe for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, explained Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on the sexual abuse of children.
He explained that there had been “ serious problems ” in terms of hiring, checking, familiarization with, training, and supervision of employees.
The hearing until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister, but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening to mark the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British policies, most of limiting his comments to foreign policy and his role as the Quartet ’ s Quartet of peacemaker in the Middle East.
When asked whether he would like to return to Prime Minister, Blair of the Evening Standard in London was quoted as saying, “ Yes, safe, but that is unlikely to happen, that is... ”
When the horse-drawn sack experts arrived in droves in Cardiff to cut the Horse of the Year, they knew that a fierce competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The knee, which is not even in the kindergarten and took its first steps only a few months ago, and his Shetland pony coffee loosely trw through the three laps and won first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of them of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
In his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had put on his plate hat in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old coffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony well above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his performance and personality.
Fenton received Toffee ee a gift for his third birthday last March and has since practiced with the Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “ Fenton and Toffee are a great team. ”
They had to fight the entire field of participants and went out of hand with gold trophy and rosette.
It was only the second time he had taken part in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells told him, “ The whole audience was like electrified, and everyone fired him and applauded him. ”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
As he has started, it won ’ t be long before he is on the “ Horse of the Year ” show – and I ’ m sure he will do well.
As one annual horse spokesman said, “ Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony. ”
Together they are great.
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee on how well they would have beaten and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They take care of good cooperation between the pony and the guide – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fenton's sweet clothing played her part, which really suited perfectly for the occasion.
The Chinese Newspaper calls for ‘ reform ’
A Chinese newspaper on the front page calling for the release of a reporter accused of defamation to be reformed, said a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a semi-state-owned firm.
As the regulator declared, the New Express is now undergoing a “ comprehensive rectification.
The “ Rectification Order ” was issued by the Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the Neue Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“ The editorial management of the Neue Express was disorderly, ” the regulator announced in a statement.
She said that it had been decided to “ impose an administrative punishment on Chen Yongzhou and deprive him of his reporter license. ”
In addition, “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to fully rectify the New Express and recommended that to identify the relevant in positions of responsibility at the New Express and immediately check the New Express New Express leadership team. ”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and backed his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television, admitting that he had published false reports for a fee.
“ In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence, ” he told the state news station CCTV.
I did so primarily because I was eager for money and fame.
It has become clear to me that I have done the wrong thing.
Following Chen ’ s apology, the New Express released an apology on the front page, declaring that it had failed to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced, despite an amendment to the law at the beginning of the year preventing the authorities from forcing someone to accuse themselves.
The US-Mexico Drug Tunnel
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical railway operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the tunnel measuring 120 times 90 centimetres as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, which makes it easier to hide drug-loaded lorries.
According to the authorities, the tunnel was closed down before drugs could be transported unrecognized.
According to the Court, eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were seized during the discovery of the tunnel.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of owning and selling marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened with prison sentences between ten years and life in the event of a guilty sentence.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of purification channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, presenting the drug cartels with the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to the users.
In 2010, the authorities found a 640 metre rail passage that ran from a kitchen in a home in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom spoke about the separation of his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, which was to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, " sometimes life is not exactly as we plan or hope. "
Kerr and he still loved himself, the 36 stressed.
" We will support each other and love Flynn's parents ".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to encyclopaedia, veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism, but is very different from it.
While vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream, ice cream or a strong Edam, these delicacies are not on a vegan's menu.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the abandonment of meat and fish, the vegan discourages all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one might wonder, but on closer examination, the vegan world of nutrition is remarkably imaginative.
" Broad spreads are very popular, " explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local Reformhaus, who offers a wide range of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
The native of New Zealand has lived vegan for 13 years, in Lampertheim he will find (almost) everything he needs to live.
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
" Conviction came not only because of the diet, but also because of the choice of shoes, " says Proctor, who prefers normal leather to artificial leather.
He recognized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, vegan is an ethic.
" I don't want animals to die for me, " Proctor says the vegans' maxim, which covers all consumption patterns.
Instead of mourning burgers, stirring eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products and enthusiasm increased.
" It's a double bonus, " says Proctor today, " in fact, vegan is not a renunciation, an asceticism, but an enrichment. "
And it was precisely these conditions that made some well-intentioned attempts fail.
" The addictive factor is a decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking, " Proctor makes a comparison.
And says:' Certain tastes cannot be attached to the animal'.
Often it is the spices or the way they are prepared that make up the taste.
" You can create the same effect in other ways, " explains the vegan.
Proctor, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and also some vegan sausages to a barbecue.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should taste hearty.
Of course, there is a desire to have something between the teeth, that is legitimate.
" It should taste, but it should not be reduced to animal food alone, " says Proctor.
He did not suffer any damage to health, right up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me there was a positive aspect to the changeover.
I do not accept foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed themselves exclusively.
" My blood values are excellent, I get checked often, " says Proctor.
In particular, many vegansim critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
" Because animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is doubtful whether the vitamin -B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the chest, " Proctor says.
For vegans there is also the possibility to eat the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
" My B12 values are in order, " he explains.
Proctor for food procurement need not go a long way.
After all, there are staple foods everywhere, and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
I find everything I need on the ground.
From time to time I buy something special.
'Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive, but it is well known that this is the case with' ordinary' finished products'.
In any case, preparing vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed.
" There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small tricks you can achieve good, if not partly better, results, " says Proctor.
Margargarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with his vegan cheese cake Proctor was also able to surprise his father-in-law.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
That will have dynamism, if you cook together, it will be given a new importance.
" The situations that can arise are as different as people themselves, " says Proctor.
Of course, he has already been sceptical.
Does my food taste any more?
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk? " - on such questions you have to act as a vegan with sensitivity.
" I do not reject the people, I am part of this society, " Proctor does not want to have an enclave gas.
And, more closely, the everyday world does not seem as strange as suspected - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as is commonly assumed.
Fast food is permitted.
There are chips everywhere!
" Many döner shops offer Falafel, or even a vegetarian Yufka, " says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he uses pasta dishes or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow to prepare for this.
'When I started feeding myself vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult,' the New Zealanders can find a development:' You have to talk to the people, make them aware of it'.
" If there are plenty of inquiries, they may be inclined to supplement the menu, " he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the compartment in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everybody can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
" Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others, " Proctor notes.
" If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of them impossible in advance, " says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Particularly when you learn to understand that you can also contain animal additives in peanuts as paint, you seem to be quickly losing courage by following ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: " Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are added, but also are cleaning.
" Gradually you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to pay attention to " It is sometimes better to do small steps than stop or stumble, " says Proctor tor.
Veganism is an important moral finger that hits consciousness.
He may not entirely be able to get rid of his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question their habits.
The exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers on track.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon.
In a communication, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other 11 US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of small and larger breakdowns at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour because to data transport errors.
In August of this year, there were two breakdowns in a week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massive faulty purchasing contracts to option markets because of technical problems.
As a result, it took the stock exchange operators almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all US equity trade stalled for several hours because of a computer breakdown at the Nasdaq exchange.
The Facebook IPO also caused a stir last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not cope with the flood of purchase and sales orders, later discovered the SEC ’ s Exchange Supervisory Authority, and diverted the company to a record $10 million.
Konstanz: Cyclists around 63-year-old
According to the police, the accident occurred when a man 26 years old was travelling on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., on a women ’ s bike incorrectly on the left walk from the Bahnhofplatz to the market place.
When a 63 year-old man suddenly walked from a restaurant, the cyclist could not put the brakes in time, according to the police.
During the subsequent collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went further to the ground and pulled a 15 cencentimetre of space on his head.
A rescue car team took the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police provide Assange with an extradition notice
The British police have today handed over an extradition decision to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and applied for asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard declared that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a “ invitation to face up ” asking him to appear in a police station, and, if he fails to do so, he was threatened with arrest.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden for indictment in a sexual offence after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he had sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and sought political asylum from the South American country.
Scotland Yard had “ sent a request to a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at the time we chose, ” said one spokesman.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears that he will be extradited by Sweden to the United States and accused of possible charges of espionage after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic news on WikiLeaks ’ revelation website.
Driders who were stuck between their legs at 210 km / h and a hot drink will receive a £1,000 penalty.
A driver was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km / h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped at the A120 Braintree on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz.
After stopping him, the police discovered the beverage between his legs.
Howie declared himself guilty before the Colchester District Court without having taken the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month ban.
Howie was also sentenced to paying £90 and a £100 victim charge.
Foreign property owners Tax on London ’ s speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but it is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who imposed a 7% stamp tax in the 2012 budget on homes costing more than £2 million and annual fees for buyers, housing as a company, not individuals.
Already, the revenues from stamp property tax in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which reached £708 million in the 2012 13 tax year, exceed the revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, the northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region put together.
Cook said, “ After stamp tax increases on high-price housing and the introduction of related legislation to circumvent it, it is hard to say that high-quality real estate is too low taxed, regardless of the impact of the outdated local tax system. ”
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying real estate in London, or discourage owners from selling, ” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to 10% of the housing market by price – in the wealthy south-thwest belt of London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has become more expensive by a record 11.8% last year.
According to Central London, prices grew at 5.6% per year, but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market, ” in which the south-western part of the city, the north (7.4%), and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to Savills.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the context in which a dog ’ s tail is associated with its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wander more to the right with the tail (from the dog's point of view) while on the left with nervous dogs.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “ Humans are well aware that the left and right halves of the brain react differently to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions. ”
Here we have tried to look at other species.
He also noted that in dogs, as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left, and vice versa, and that the two hemisphes played different roles in feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral swats of their fellow species, researchers supervised the animals as these films from other dogs watched.
They measured the heart rate of four-legged and analyzed behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, “ We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we have been able to steer the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right. ”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog that wings), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience which movements they should and should not worry about.
He said, “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and swing with the tail in one direction is more associated to friendly behavior, and if the right tends to produce less friendly behavior, you react on the basis of these experiences. ”
Researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinary surgeons and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behaviour and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Medicine at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study examining whether dogs were important on the left and right.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog, and to the right when it is a satisfied dog.
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada, “ Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog when his “ tail ” wings left, than right, rather than become restless – just the other way than in the Italian study. ”
According to him, the differences could be that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for various purposes, many of the details remain to be determined – and dogs are no exception, ” Bradshaw said.
Since their behaviour can easily be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction and sometimes in the other.

Pope Francis appoints the First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and it is they who elect a Pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately help elect his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal aged 80 can no longer take part in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals. ”
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as consistency, is held.
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene consistency in February so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned, ” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals is likely to have fallen by February.
He said that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of cardinals eligible to vote is another 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he likes.
Next year's consistency is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, according to Valero.
At the moment, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and Italy in particular.
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance, ” he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything by himself.
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him, ” said Valero.
He said that it is perfectly possible for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
So far, however, we have not been in this position – all of this is completely new.
Valero said that the bishops from large places are typically called cardinals, but Francis are “ full of surprises – so we don ’ t know who he appoints. ”
GM calls new pickups in the US to repair the seat backrest
General Motors is recalling almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierrara-Pickup trucks built in 2014 to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest, according to Friday by the US vehicle safety regulator.
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for removing the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they are not complying with the federal guidelines on vehicle safety in head restraints.
“ If the vehicle is driven from behind, it is possible that the head restraint will not protect the occupants properly, so there is an increased risk of injury, ” read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The models were manufactured between August 1st and September 10th.
Delivery of GM-Trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading American car manufacturer since the insolvency related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October.
Due to the 16-day Government Shutdown, NHTSA was unable to check the letter of notification, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra-Trucks, which have been newly developed for the model year 2014, increased by 20% in the first decade of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverad-Trucks and 16,503 Sierra-Pickup-Trucks.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4% to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Cry of Despair from an Obama Electorate
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts thwarted by Republican blockade tactics.
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone strikes.
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 campaign were a sad reminder of what was possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I thought would cheer and give me hope during the gloomy second year of my medical studies.
It is called “ The Audacity to Win, ” portrabing Barack Obama ’ s memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish with my patient ’ s records in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and was able to take the breath of a speech.
The election became a landslide victory, and news spokesmen stopped to illustrate the historic significance of this hour.
My classmates cried and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on its way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama changed office in 2008, he had 82% approval ratings.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening, as if you were taken out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Something has indeed changed in the years since I first voted.
But it is simply not something I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and multifaceted things that Obama has achieved, from adopting the Affordable Care Act on Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, ending the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army, and killing Osama bin Laden.
I agree that the party political blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
However, having defended the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, my explanations have come to an end.
I have reached political despair point.
Republican blockade policies cannot explain why you allow the eavesdropping of foreign leaders or the killing of innocent children by overseas drones.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about American privacy and why whistleblowers who disclose government wrongdoing are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the limits on public funding and expenditure are being circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House ’ s efforts to silence the media are “ most aggressive since the Nixon government. ”
More recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Afdable fordable Care Act.
I do not know whether that is what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that the government work could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the Member office is not a predictable course of action, as an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate.
However, if I look at the above examples, they seem to have been largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and half-baked alternative; he seemed not to be able to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from pressure from future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard about for so long.
But, with the fall in approval ratings for Obama to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has made this book all the tougher.
It awakens in me the yearning for the many promises that have evaporated.
This week, I read a section in the book describing how Obama suffered a severe loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a meeting with the election workers following the decision, he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
“ I want us to find our magic again, ” he said.
Remember who we are.
It is five years on, Mr President, and I could not agree more with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those expressed by Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflicts of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and deputy, Clive Palmer, says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interests in his plans for parental leave, because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, in a judicial dispute over the payment of $6 million in carbon tax, claimed when he wanted to dismiss questions as to whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that are important in deciding whether to cut or cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest, and and that Abbott ’ s daughters would benefit personally from the law.
“ He is in a major conflict of interest in paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she receives holidays, ” said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer to be the winner of Fairfax ’ s Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes ahead of the recount.
Palmer called for a review of the process of counting votes so that it could proceed more quickly.
Tony Abbott ’ s daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“ We need better, ” he said.
Why should we not have a system where you invade, enter the data into a computer, dial immediately and then have the result at 6: 30 am?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballot papers.
Do you use them because you can wipe out the results if you don't like them?
It is unbelievable to vote with pencils these days.
The Electoral Commission examined the options for electronic voting and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, declared that one of his policies is an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “ very seriously. ”
A public office is about serving the public.
“ We are not looking for a reward other than history, namely that we can serve at a critical time in this community, ” he said.
RBS suspends Two Forex Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, such as two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly up rapidly.
Some of the world ’ s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, confirmed that they work with the authorities to investigate the world ’ s largest financial market, holding $5.3 trillion a day.
The two traders would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the boror interbank scandal.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspension, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
“ Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators, ” the Bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation stated that RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former vendder to the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS BS in 2010 and is said to have been attted ed by his current position as European Head of Forex Spot Trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was admitted this week, and Matt Gardiner, formerly a senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its staff after the Swiss regulator Finma declared that it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market by a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority, Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently working on charges that bankers have agreed on currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of wrongdoing.
The news about these investigations has stirred up traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year it has been pressur, because low currency volatility restricts the chances of speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign-exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
As one leading trader noted,, despite the enormous daily volume of foreign-exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms mean that “ it is possible to influence the market even with very low ticket prices. ”
The news came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she had terminated a trader of her London Exchange Traded Fund office this week, having caused a loss of just under $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and is cooperating with them.
“ We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter has been contained, ” said Credit Suisse.
Painted fence on the Bechtle plot
A group of the citizens' initiative " Schweizer Wiese " has beautified the fence on the Bechtle site on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
According to a press release, she also cleaned and widened the footpath.
The planned cover of the crumbling house at the back of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, because the area is in danger of slipping.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed the embellishment action with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the BI's action, a banner was put in place with the message' We are in favour'.
However, this did not bother up the action of the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative.
Her motto on the big poster was' We are against building ruins'.
In so doing, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the " construction site ", it became clear that some citizens believe that the realisation of the city's project would be better off for many, although quite a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project project as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city is delaying these answers further, says the BI.
As we have heard, the mayor's public statements also have an impact.
May had said at the Municipal Council Meeting that he fears the end of the thermal bath if the population were to vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the citizens' decision.
The BI press release states that some seem downright frightened, others perceive it as a " crude attempt at blackmail " of the population.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick Scarts for Schiris: Mane no Swallow King
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the " bulls " from the referees was disappointed.
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings, " he protected the two more discsiswirls at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent occasion for Rangnik's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3: 0 against Val Gardena last Sunday, when the Senegalese was fatal - but one that was not, as the TV pictures showed.
" A blatant mistake, " said Rangnick, who called referee Harkam " completely overstretched. "
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between the Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and the Gardena coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He deally defended his German compatriot: " Here I would have behaved in the same way as Roger Schmidt Roger Schmidt ".
After the skirmishes with Hütter, Schmidt himself does not want to have been in contact with his colleague.
I don ’ t know why.
" I am the one who has been insulted, " the 46-year-old stressed.
In view of the success course, however, Rangnick agreed to an anthem of praise.
" There are only two words: good, " he said.
There is not much to suspend.
The way the team plays is particularly impressive.
Let us
There will hardly be any change in winter transfer time.
There is no reason to change.
" Except a player comes up with the desire to leave the club, " Rangnick made clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s Health
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court now ruled that the health-care law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four, the judges judged that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ’ s individual mandate – forcing US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority.
Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 200-page law, and also argued that the health law ’ s health requirement would either extend the conditions for access to Medicaid or otherwise delve all state Medicaid funding was not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit had been brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been decisively rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the eventual challenger, Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian Place with Giant Light
The inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley with huge mirrors.
Due to the low level of sunshine, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord Valley, usually sink from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors, 45 metres high, a dream of a century came true on Wednesday.
" Finally! ", Mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the Startzemonie on TV2.
Some valley dwellers used sun loungers, others set up sunglasses for safety reasons.
Until now, sun-hungry people have had to take a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to steer the rays into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council had adopted the project, costing SEK 5 million (around EUR 615 000).
A similar construction has been providing the Italian Alpine resort Viganella with winter sunshine for several years.
Post hardly empty on Sundays
" Many citizens will not have noticed yet, the red dots for the Sunday staff are still located at various mailboxes in the city and the districts, but if you read the small print at the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find out that the emptying no longer takes place on Sundays and public holidays, " says the FDP.
A request from the German Free Democratic Party has confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays only emptied emptied before the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether emptied is still held on Sunday in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in the answer to the question of the FDP.
The FDP ’ s social and youth policy spokesman, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up up.
Sunday sleeving is an important postal service, especially for mail.
" Despite the increase in the price of letters in January 2013, this undertaking is becoming radical and unreasonable ".
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe for Europe, supports his group colleague:' What annoys me is the fact that emptying times are being secretly changed or even deleted'.
The post office is miles away from being close to the citizens.
" At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays, " says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
The same thing of the city, especially non-mobile citizens, should also be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday days on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city council is planning to hold talks with the post office on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
As far as he knows, however, there is also a Sunday in Hofheim.
Your party was in favour of privatisation.
" Then decisions elsewhere, " said Maier.
Frankfurt ’ s parking fees are to rise sharply.
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
This morning, the city ’ s magistrate advises a presentation by traffic decerner Stefan Majer (Green).
As a result, parking fees are to be increased by 50%.
For this purpose, however, prices are not to be increased, but to reduce the time interval of parking clocks and vending machines from 30 minutes to 20 minutes.
In December, the meeting of the City Council will have to decide.
The retail committee of the Chamber of Commerce Frankfurt believes this' is not a good idea'.
The possibility of parking in front of the shop is " a significant advantage for smaller dealers ".
The transport club Germany is of the opinion that, after two decades, an increase is' reasonable and long overdue'.
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
City of joy: Fast promotions come by surprise hosts
The ords I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen, Germany.
The elders were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it became apparent that they could not keep up with the rapid actions of the cities of joy, even as a result of age.
The patrons found it extremely difficult with the hard and placed surcharges.
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz neatly over the middle of the network and were not there to defend the block.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of joy in all respects.
In view of this suffocating and playful achievement, the third set was won somewhat lax and sluggishly at the 3: 0 final (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).
On November 2nd the TV Baiersbronn, which clearly succeeded in Nagold, will be a much more powerful opponent in the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In B-class the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt met in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They did a fiercely contested two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points mainly in the acceptance of the ball; in the passports, too, precision was sometimes scarce, and in some critical game scenes the overzealousness prevented a focus on possible point gains.
In this very balanced meeting, however, Marcus Blasutto ’ s TUPS team consistently reflected the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Care Day at the Small English Hut
In the meantime, the fifth care day in the succession to the Natura 2000 project Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
On the basis of suggestions from the population, the view of the valley should be opened on this day in the area of the hut, said mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the splendour of the gorge, where the landscape offers the ideal setting for wonderful views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that care Day was an appropriate instrument for strengthening the link between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set the tone in nature.
At the same time, with the tourist aspect, account can also be taken of the environment.
Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Nature Conservation of the President of the Government of Freiburg explained this ecological aspect following the welcome by the State Councillor Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action every success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the foresight coincides with the aim of preserving the old Allmendweidfeld, which has grown strongly with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the remaining pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grass swps, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest land.
You need these free connections for the preservation of species.
Tribukait said that she would not want to stand up for the planned biosphere area at this point.
Not only does the current measure fit in seamlessly with this plan.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous complement to what has been achieved with the Life project as well as to the previous days of care for the future.
After these various speeches, district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had been beated beforehand and the forestry tractor would be available if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of exempting juniper bushes and caring for a dry stone lock.
The aim was to see the vantage point.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the spa town of Löffingen, with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking policy on school, children, youth and the citizens, as well as its own urban works, can be described as an attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet registered.
The 46-year-old bank traker and economman Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has been the only candidate for succession of the mayor, Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for reasons of age.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11th, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents.
On Thursday, the group, which owns thousands of previous Nordic patents, launched an avalanche of complaints about patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it outbid in Nortel ’ s insolvency auctioning.
Rockstar, the consortium that had bought the North patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei, and four other companies for patent infringements before the US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that brings search terms on the Internet into line with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit that goes to the heart of Google ’ s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not within easy reach.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC manufacture phones working with Google ’ s Android operating system, which is fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of more than $900 million for Nordic patents.
Google increased its offer several times, most recently offering $4.4 billion.
After outpassing Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google Motorola acquired Mobility for $12.5 billion, a shop motivated in part by Motorola's library of patents.
“ Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the legal patents at the auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so, ” says the lawsuit.
Rockstar claims a high deal of compensation from Google because it claims that Google ’ s patent infringement is deliberate.
Egypt Sworn in First freely elected Presidents
Mohamed Morsi sworn in, but his Day of Triumph should not mean the end of Egypt ’ s political disputes.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt ” when he was sworn in as the country ’ s first freely elected president, succeed Hosni Mubarak, who had been driven out of office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the monarchy was overthrown about 60 years ago.
He took the oath in front of the 18 black robes judges of the court, based on the Nile and modelelled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
“ We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic, ” Morsi said at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“ Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy, and stability, ” said 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had mostly been sharply targeted by the respective government as a banned organization since its inception 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in the court to celebrate the new president, and, unlike the Mubarak presidential splendour, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the car convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Scked as the Brotherhood ’ s uncharismatic “ replacement wheel, ” his personal prestige has increased since his victory and Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as Islamists ’ candidate, but as all those who sought to target the 2011 uprising ’ s efforts against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“ Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state, ” explained Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, to judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he sworn in.
Later, Morsi travelled to the University of Cairo, where he was to make his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel that played the national anthem to which he listened in haesteboem.
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival he was greeted by hundreds of people present in the university ’ s largest auditorium with speakers from The Army and the People are One Hand.
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University of Cairo became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970 ’ s.
On Friday, Morsi oath to Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led last year to the end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule, and he vowed to reclaim the presidential powers that the Military Council had taken over from the expted leader.
But by removing the official oath before the court and not, as usual, Parliament, he is bowing to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi ’ s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberg disco ensures two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg disco " Blue Velvet " started.
On Friday evening it says " Pump this party ", tomorrow Saturday evening will continue with a maximum of 25 party.
fat beats and cool sounds will of course be promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers crashed by ladders: seriously injured
On Thursday, when a defective external senswas changed, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder and injured himself seriously.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to change a defective heating feeling on the exterior facade of an inn.
When he climbed onto the ladder attached to the gutter, it slipped away and the man crashed into the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Landeskrankenhaus Salzburg with the rescue helicopter " Christophorus 6 ".
Rapist in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to life on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim later died as a result of serious injuries.
Johannes Kana was found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had caused horror nationwide.
The 21-year-old raped Anene Booysen in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town in February.
For 14 hours the doctors struggled for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of young people was so appalling that carers and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the trial that she had been in a bar with Booysen.
He also admitted that he had beaten and raped her, but he denied that he was responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had initially assumed several perpetrators, but dismissed two suspects because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The Public Prosecutor's Office also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost a part of everyday life in South Africa: there are around 64 000 complaints of sexual violence every year.
That is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has far more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
However, the police and women ’ s associations in South Africa estimate the number of unreported cases of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the " best ham in the world ": For the TV show " Galileo " he visited the Pro7 star Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear at the outset that the most important thing for the ham is the pork clubs, but turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
In other words, can the ham obtained in any supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains to Jumbo the working methods of the company " Adler " in Bonndorf.
" Germany's favourite ham ", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and mills can it enter the interior of the factory.
Jumbo, too, must disinfect his hands before he is allowed to use the microphone.
Jumbo sighted to strengthen Schnellimbiss in Waldshut
" Here I am working with sling quantities, " I am amazed by the television makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 culculs per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat, color: Uli explains what quality matters.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months old.
Television of a standard?
Details such as the ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
" I am curious to see what happens Roberto Blanco, " Jumbo cynically.
This is where the level of private television in pure culture is presented.
It is worth watching.
The spectator can see that dismantling the culls is still manual work.
Black Forest ham can traditionally be found on the shelf without bones.
The secret of ham is spice mixing with salt.
Smoking tower and smoke fire Jumbo visually reminiscent of a " submarine ".
The trick: fir branches provide the special taste of the Black Forest ham in the smoke.
After all, 20 days in smoke make the ham almost black.
" Now the disk disappears in the jumbo, " he announces the test feeding.
" That's really delicious, " concludes the TV star.
That is something that all those involved will be able to live with.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the year as a whole and expects record income from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects adjusted pre-tax gains of between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to 315 million in its previous forecast.
Achieving the current targets will mean growth of 12-17% compared to a record profit of $290.4 million in 2011-12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre made eight per cent profits in the first half of the year and made a strong start into the second half of the year, especially in Australian and British private business.
“ Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are well on the way to record-year revenues before interest and taxes, ” he said.
These include Australia and Great Britain, which are typically among our strongest winners.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, balancing a slightly weaker business market.
Things went similarly well for Flight Centre ’ s leisure business in the UK, while here too business customers spent less.
US business recovered compared to the seasonal weaker first half of the year, so profits are expected for the full year for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre shares yesterday rose by 3 cents to $38.20.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling, and grammar.
In courses on English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes “ unseen texts ” in order to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be done away with.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to take an independent GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education will publish the new English and mathematics curricula – the first subjects radically redesigned.
Other subjects will change next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Examination Supervisory Authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence, ” stressing that the GCSs will become “ more challenging, ambitious, and stricter. ”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
By contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to allow more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that comprehensive mathep testing – combined with greater ranking weighting of the profession – is likely to encourage schools to spend more hours.
The curriculum places more attention on “ real life problems, ” including financial mathematics.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
The next Ecumenical Forum for Talks on Monday, 21 October, at the Neue Museum des SchSchloss will deal with the topic " On Hölle mit Hölle - Theological reflections on today's handling of the last things ".
Lecturer is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Talk Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant church communities of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of the Bodenseekreis.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum how people classify the " last things " after death.
If people had known too much about this over the past few centuries, relying on those images of heaven and hell that " shape our ideas to this day ", contemporary prophetic doctrine of hopes of completion was characterised more by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
" The greater hope has been driven out to Christians by religious critique, " says the speaker.
She' gave us so many question marks that we seem to have lost exclamation marks'.
Johanna Rahner goes on to say:' However, the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death'.
Related to this is the question of the desire' which dreams that everything will be good in the end'.
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in Dr. theol. in 1997, also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamentaltheology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität.
Johanna Rahner has held a chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel since 2010.
Geilingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Little Heuberg reaffirm their declaration of faith.
101 15 and 16 adolescents of the Seeldienst einheit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been renamed in two services.
The service accompanied in the morning by the group Laudato-Si, in the afternoon by the youth choir The Spirit.
By receiving the company sacrament, the young people said' yes' to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous members of the parish, the companies had prepared for the great holiday.
In various projects they became acquainted with various tasks of the Christian community and experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal together.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In fine weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the tour of the hills around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel from the organising sports club Illmensee informs this.
Among the participants, especially at a short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude, were numerous cyclists who once wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the top German class also took part in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz achieved good rankings at the German Championships with the recommendation.
As expected, these two were able to abandon the field.
As last year, Felix Bader was able to save a small lead to the finish line and defended his title as overall short distance winner.
Pascal Treubel was once again placed in second place.
Among the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the nightmare team who made it to the top of the winning stairs.
Anne nobility from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen came second and third.
A gratifying development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
It was not only in terms of performance that the full range of sportsmen and women was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years among the youngest to over 70 years among the oldest starters.
In the main race this year even more absolute top athletes were at the start.
Four drivers were able to set themselves off from the top regional drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a semi-mountain bike professional from the Black-Tusk-racing team.
Pangerl, together with a team mate, has already been the World Champion in 12-hour driving twice.
This year he became European Champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already owns two German championship titles in the duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, an eyelashes hit finals in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to rest over the finish line.
Only one second behind it the routine Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann reached their goal as third parties in the overall standings.
In the women's standings, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
Areane Blersch won second place from binding barriers in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and organised running of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend treating hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or with your Mobile Devices
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 in CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to elect him “ CNN Hero of the Year. ”
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his exceptional work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his sick father lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation spread to his brain, causing a haematomas to affect him for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, ” Georges Bwelle.
We would have released it from Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“ It ’ s not easy, ” comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has scarcely changed since Bwell ’ s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people each, according to the World Health Organisation.
In the United States, on the other hand, the ratio lies with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most cameroons could not afford to visit them.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of domestic health expenditures are private.
“ The only problem they have is poverty, ” says Bwelle.
Poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffer made Bwelle decide to do something about it.
Dr Georges Bwelle and his voluntary team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas at weekends and provides free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his voluntary group have helped just under 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people forced themselves on minibuses and ride with the snowed medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
Not always smoothly.
On more than one occasion, they have had to push the vehicles by means of rivers and sludge.
But when they arrive, they are received like heroes: a feast, singing and dance, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care really is a cause for celebration and wave – with its broad smile and unlimited energy – is part at the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team will start the examination of hundreds of patients.
“ We treat 500 people per journey, ” says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides healthcare in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for school but that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anaesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or an apartment; after the operation, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the surgical and disinfection equipment is fed by the group generator, so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday.
It ’ s a strenuous pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“ They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work, ” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work that has been done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations over the past year, and knows that its work makes a huge difference for the people it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a break he received now allowed him to work again.
“ That changes the future of my family, ” the man said.
Besides the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activities, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“ I really don't t know when he ’ slesleeping, ” says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteering into Bwell's group.
He is always either in hospital or tempted to raise money for the organisation so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
“ We can be involved in operations where we help extract blood or consider the instruments to be Dr. Bwelle, ” explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon themselves and often bring with them donated sanitary equipment.

Excellent Combat
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel " The Old Man and the Sea ", is cut to Horst Janson.
Janson is an old rabbit in his profession, the art of acting.
No one can deceive the old man Santiago.
In this way, the two simply complement each other magnificently.
You almost think that you can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man referred to by the young man, Manolo.
When Santiago sits on the chair tired of life, that is real for Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is a thoroughly character role that Janson has mastered excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man, who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his will.
Janson was born in Los Angeles, California.
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention, so his monologue is not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that spectators forget that the sea is made up of blue lit bottles of water.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man in the boat act in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance he puts the active scene in the light: the Santiago hut, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, which sings Cuba's sense of life with her songs and her splendid voice.
The four musicians play Cuba ’ s rhythm and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to Romans
A sewage channel from the Roman period has been preserved beneath Cologne at a length of about 120 metres.
If you visit Cologne, you can't miss the cathedral.
The two towers rise about 157 metres and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
Few visitors who admire the two delicate church towers can imagine that there is also a lot to discover beneath the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the underworld of Cologne.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the Service Centre of Köln-Tourismus right next to the cathedral.
The tour starts unspectacular: " We start in the underground garage, " says Schulze.
In the seventies, the fathers of the city wanted a decent city, and that is why only what was not too large stopped from the remains of the old city wall.
Most users of the multi-storey car park are therefore rushing past the Roman remains and only parking their cars.
However, if you take a closer look, you will find an archaeological site in the Parkdeck D2, separated by metal grids.
You can see about five metre high ruins made of hand-held sized stones.
" They are the remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century B.C., " says Schulze.
Before it comes back to light, Schulze lets the participants on the upper level of the park take a look at a dark 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, is hardly noticed either.
Nearby stop of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants descend again.
This is the seat of once the most powerful man north of the Alps, the preactor of CCAA.
A visitor would like to know what CCAA means.
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ", which in good German means as much as " City of Roman Law and the City of the Agrippinensers, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the imperial cult ".
The pretorium is the former palace, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
A tunnel leads from the anteroom of the exhibition to the Roman sewage canal, which is preserved here at about 120 metres in length.
" You can walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you like, " Schulze encourages guests.
A surprise still exists.
After getting the key at the box office, he leads the group to a 16 metre deep, walkable shaft.
" We are now in Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath, " he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to obtain the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing.
To this day in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work is due to begin shortly.
However, it will be a few years before it is completed.
My leg almost hacked: Replacing the Rock Process
A bloody attack in the rockermilieu is being reopened after more than four years.
A trial began for attempted manslaughter, dangerous physical injury and damage to property against two 30 year olds, before the District Court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants remain silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and to have been one of the bandidos at the time.
The Public Prosecutor's Office accuses them, together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt, of knocking in three men in a car in June 2009.
All the victims have been seriously injured, and a man has almost lost his leg.
Victims are said to have listened to the competing grouping of Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
This was apparently preceded by a multi-car chase.
According to charges, it was about battles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
A court spokesman said then that it could not be proved that men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice overturned the ruling following the revision of the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office and referred it back to the District Court for retrial.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for a different offence.
At the beginning the main focus was on the reconstruction of the procedures during the night.
The Commissioner investigating at the time was invited to witness.
The focus was on mobile phone talks between the defendants and other people who had intercepted by the police.
What is difficult is that Rocker almost always abide by a law that is close to them in court - and not testify.
The same is true of the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims packed.
Public Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office, Frankfurt (Oder), said on request that new traces have appeared since the last trial.
Eleven more days are scheduled for the process.
The Disable Society Wouldn ’ t Think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it goes home.
The only thing is that hunger is noticeable in the people's bellies on the front-passenger and back seats.
Of course, one or two cocktails or champagne may be responsible for this!
What could be more obvious than driving chilled to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a little bit?
I admit that I am happy to be there when it comes to fast food late or early in the morning.
A few chips, a cola, a burger - and then not home and bed!
On the way home, however, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco singers are making themselves felt.
After all, what should you miss from constantly throwing your fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially at the weekends, there are discarded paper bags on the edge of the road and in parking spaces.
'Why?', I wonder.
Are people too doof to take the bags home or until the next trash bin?
It is not only that the paper stuff spoils the landscape.
Tags have also concealed transport facilities such as safety barriers, causing accidents.
But what does said' disposable society " not think about, presumably it does not even know what that word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other rubbish are there.
A few bags would be more or less no x - unlike the road, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I can already see the day coming when the towns and communities become stupid - and the fast-food chains have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Obama ’ s Health Backline
After strong criticism yesterday, President Obama tracked down on his oft-repeated, clear promise: “ If you like your health insurance, you can keep it. ”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of dismissal, the Republicans have in recent days in the president of deceived the American public.
Yesterday, Obama made his original promise.
“ The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it, ” he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama called on those Americans who have received such communications to look for a new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaply than forecast.
“ They come up with a better offer, ” he said.
The government saw it as no surprise that the 5% of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff, because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“ I would like to say quite directly to these Americans: they deserve better, ” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House ’ s Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, explained that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October.
“ I ’ m as frustrated and angry as all the others, ” she said.
I regain your confidence.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to sit behind her at yesterday ’ s House of Representatives hearing was received after a dispute with the Republican MP Billy Long of Missouri about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of consultation, Long Sebelius repeatedly harassed why the Affordable Care Act “ architect ” had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to take out a tariff at HealthCare.gov that she now wanted to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Base
An American official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed to the American news station CNN on Thursday that Israeli fighter planes attacked an air base in Latakia, Syria the day before.
According to CNN, the objective had been' missiles and related equipment' which the Israeli Government feared had been destined for Lebanese Hezbollah.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shred from Wednesday to Thursday on the night, and the Israelis blamed for this.
The Israeli television station Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, showing Russian S-125 Neva defence missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and allow warheads to transport up to 70 kilograms.
The government in Jerusalem did not officially confirm the attack.
But the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli official by saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not safe.
In any case, one spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said:' We are not commenting on these reports'.
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried earlier, partly successfully, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a' red line', followed by a military response.
John Kerry says in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has “ gone unreasonably too far. ”
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, suggested a weakening of US defensive stance on its surveillance programs by saying that espionage has “ gone unreasonably too far ” in certain cases.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he shared responsibility with Barack Obama for using “ autopilot ” when the whistleblower Edward Snowden ’ s explosive revelations about the NSA ’ s spying activities became public.
The leaked information has given the US government a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
In a video-bound ated speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said, “ There is no doubt that the President and I and others in the government have learned about a number of things that almost been done by autopilot, simply because there was the capacity to do what dates back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to September September. ”
He then became the first senior member of the US government to admit that US espionage had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, ‘ In some cases, this has gone unreasonably too far ’.
The President is determined to clarify and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one needs to feel that this is an abuse.
I can assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be compromised in this process.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force of good, and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, “ We are facing a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves up. ”
There is a radical extremism in the world obsessed with killing people, blowing up, and attacking governments.
So what would happen if we were able to intercept it and stop it before it happens?
We have indeed prevented airplane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people, because we have heard about such plans beforehand.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to allay concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US on counter-terrorism efforts, as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs declared on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations because of the frustration with surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board in regard to our joint efforts against terrorism, ” said Murphy, who sits in the Senate for the first time as a democrat and serves as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear there that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger through the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were incorrect and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited from documents passed on by Snowden that the NSA had monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national secret services, James Clapper, defended espionage among allies to be necessary and declared that this was customary on both sides.
In all this uproar, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the trip of Congress to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other Members of this House are to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route is still under construction.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some “ serious words. ”
He said that European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes that they themselves have been using for years.
“ While we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy, ” Murphy says.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is about to visit the Middle East and Poland at the weekend to address resentment about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent violation of the ankle joint threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller from being deployed in the Bundesliga outside match of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is about to make a assignment by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
Up to now, he has only been able to do so individually.
" We will decide on his dedication in the short term, " said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalscorer with six hits.
The Mainzers already have to do without the wounded service providers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian appeals against prison in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for wrongly claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June of making a false statement to the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men held her.
Later, however, video camera recordings showed that she had reached her hotel safely after she was separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they admitted that they had invented the story.
Until trial she was in police custody on the ground.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence at a low-security prison in Phuccas, held in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian Rubgy League player, who contached the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help with his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about his daughter ’ s well-being and wanted to have her back in Australia.
“ We are, of course, very concerned, but we hope that she will be back at home as soon as possible, ” said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is at large on a bail of 50,000 Baht.
According to Australian reports, in the meantime she is on holiday in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The Court said that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that, following the recent murder of the travel clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may seek to improve its battered tourist image, resulting in a acquittal.
