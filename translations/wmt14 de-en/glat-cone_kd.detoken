Gutach ’ Increased ans safety
They are less than 100 metres apart: on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian light at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older town hall light.
Two facilities so close to each other: intentional or shield d' stroke?
Mr ’ s mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
" The town hall amp was installed at that time because it ensures the school path, " explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights safe cyclists, bus passengers and the mountain residents.
The plant officially put into operation yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße intersection.
We have a museum, two churches, a spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ‘ Grub ’.
" In order to safety safety the high volume of traffic and pedestrian had had another traffic light, " says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the District Council of Offenburg.
" According to current measurements, around 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B33, of which about 10% are heavy goods vehicles, " stresses Arnold.
The construction of another traffic light is therefore more than necessary: " Safety is just first here, " says Arnold.
A total of four traffic views were carried out and a roundabout was also envisaged, but discarded again because of the narrowness in the intersection of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before during choosing the location of the traffic lights: " We by means of a transporter loaded especially us us with particularly long logs logs logs to tested whether these vehicles could leave from the sulphur stream to the B33 without bending around the traffic lights ".
The traffic light system, cocosts around EUR 000 euros itself, is the " most modern on the market today, " explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so vigorously that the lights can be easily recognized by drivers even when the sun is low, for example.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones consume only eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian press the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, green comes immediately for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
A further radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be completed.
" Should a group or disabled people take the streets, the start-up phase will be extended, so everyone can cross the road safely, " explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver must have their part as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: as soon as the traffic lights for pedestrians showed green, an upper class vehicle rushed through - with red shining.
For more than 30 years Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth about the soul.
The Carinthian poet has described many times the catastrodisasters of his Catholic village children - the speechlessness, the tendency towards brute violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and jojolessness.
The winner of the Büchner Prize is best known as a prose author, and theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage made of prose texts Gerhard Fresacher therefore compiles a collage of prose texts for his performance " Wetterleuchten auf der Tongue Peak ", which can now be seen in Garage X on St. Peter's Square.
The theatre maker, for example, combines elements from the autobiographical novel " Der Serf " (1987) with prosaminiiniatures from " Leichnam, seine Familie liizing " (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important props: a cruagsting sofa on which a ting and masturbation are made - the eight-person ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little trust in the text.
The 70-minute performance covers up the original with a wealth of directing cases, from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
The actresses, in particular, who come their in the sometimes somewhat dubious scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, dised with their head underwater, ackcked on the wall with their evening robes.
Forced into cellophane or bo, they stroke on dangerously high stinths through the production, either monologize them loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveyed in this strenduous way.
The evening has the best moments when singing - ranging from deep purple to popular songs.
It is only towards the end that the overturned performance come to rest a little, and Winkler ’ s almost absurd humor fhes up.
A Blackbox in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway system and believe that they found the solution in a small black box that can fit in the dashboard of each car.
The equipment that records every kilometre travelling and reporting information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colourful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups, advocating that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres travelled – and also where they have been driven – and then use the information to calculate tax humories.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The US Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But, while Congress cannot agree on how to proceed, several states are not waiting any longer.
They are currently considering how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This really is a must for our country.
“ It ’ s nothing we ’ ll use, ” said Hasan Ikhrata, CEO of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles travelled with all Califor’ s drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed by taxes, by Americans pay at the fuel dispsers, is bankrupt.
But America no longer has as much filling as it used to do.
Cars consume less petrol.
The government oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians, at high fuel prices, do not dare raise the tax by even one cent.
“ The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable, ” says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mileage payment system.
“ This is the most useful alternative in the long term, ” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a milebased user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea popular to urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases.
California ’ s planners rely on the system to devise strategies to achieve the state ’ s ambitious, legal climate change goals.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees this as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Reason Foundation ’ s free marketers are also fond by the idea of making drivers pay after the distance they travelled.
“ This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole, ” explains Adrian Moore, Reason ’ s Vice President for guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US Transport Secretary, who, in a report in 2011 called on Congress to move toward milebased reckoning.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project covering 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to the concerns of rural deputies who represent people who often have to travel many miles to work or to the city.
Several states and large cities are nevertheless moving in this direction on their own.
Oregon, who currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s biggest experiment, is the most committed.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees to the state instead of the petroleum tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with lorries.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with equipment, drivers were skeptical about the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements.
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem, ” explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Rescome Management at the the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People did not want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its Web site: “ It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into full-fledged monitoring equipment. ”
There is no need to build a gigantic, obscsome technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology to allow the state to capture the kilometers, but not exactly when and where.
That, Khan says,, also rerepublic public public.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not originally start to help states tax drivers.
Rather, their aim was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for motor insurance, with drivers having pay on the basis of the miles travelled.
However, the devices she tests are also of interest to road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded, ” explained Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have made in some of these public pilot mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of achieving this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment to give drivers a variety of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any equipment at all and pay a flat rate instead based on the average miles travelled by all state residents.
Other bodies hope to sell the concept of a distruicious public by providing the devices with more functions than fewer.
In New York City, transport officials want to develop a tax device that can be you to pay parking fees, pay only for kilometers travelling, and collect speed data in real time from other vehicles that enable drivers to avoid congestion.
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system, ” says a planning document of the city.
However road planners plannhowever wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area declared that Congress could solve the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund problem simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they, too, pay a fair share.
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient, ” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission ’ s head of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small Team Beats over
The Voluntary Fire Brigade took her men's test with flying colours despite a lack of staff.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
In his assumption of practice, demental commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the pen in Burgberger Straße.
A short circuit a is is to have been created during sawing.
Two people were injured as a result of the fire and the development in smoking, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two respiratory protectors of the defence prepared to enter the building.
After a short period of time we managed to find the first person and lead him outside.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy because there was also a narrow staircase to cross.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
There were also electrical machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via a flood hydrante about 100 meters away.
Three extingution attacks have now been launched.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer ’ s exercise was also about showing what can be done with low-available staff.
In the event of an emergency, support is provided via the Königsfeld daily deployment group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking universities and companies Important
During his visit to the Breisgau Black Forest district, the President of the country parliament, Guido Wolf, was also enlightened in Titisee-Neustadt where tomorrow ’ s workers came from.
At the High Black Forest Support Centre, together with the managing directors of the vocational schools, the Kreisgymnasium and the chairmen of the Par' Advisory Board, he investigated this important issue.
" Education is an important location factor, " underlined Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Centre the High Black Forest.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and Berufsschulzentrum in the Wälderstadt.
He also praised the family-friendliness of the county.
" It is important to look not only at the family phase, but also at the phase of caring for for loved ones due to demographic change, " Wolf explained.
He also said that more increasing more employees were taking caring for and caring for their loved ones.
'Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship,' Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose a skilled workforce, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses.
" Anyone who has already come to know the benefits of the region during their studies are often preserved with the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills, which helps strengthen the region, " was the of the the was convinced.
Only if sufficient appappticticeships were offered can the needs of skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the district ’ s location advantage is its favourable location in south-west Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
On his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to develop local public transport.
'Perseversevere and ensure that public transport improves,' he explained to the local cors present.
Experience an entertaining Afternoon with Music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietingen seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a vesper.
In the past, the elderly were served in the resting place.
In the meantime this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The residents looked forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmir talked to popular melodies.
The more than 100 year old natural stone wall as the front delimation of the old school yard about be renovation and the Kirchstraße is once once again be included on the rehabilitation costs of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days leading up to the Kilbig, a small angle wall was installed during the first work of the renovation of the front school yard to stabilize and sttically tically relieve the more than one hundred d-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The further procedure provides, according to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlingen City Building Office, to involve the State Monument Office in the planning and to draw up a renovation concept for the old wall.
According to this, a cost calculation is to be carried out by experts, which will then to be submitted to the local council to decide and determine how to proceed.
A decision on this is expected to be taken as early as next year.
After the renovation, pavement and planting of the old inner courtyard within the two side wof the school, built in 1912, the boundary wall in need of be be renovated placed placed on a new structure in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure.
The historic, one red-year-old old delimwall of the old school yard to the Kirchstrasse is in need of rement, especially due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, and has an arch incpensity forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a school yard used by pupils, which has been done through means the current fastening work.
Originally, school school bishment was even planned in 2008 / 2009, but high unplanned expenditure resulted in a postponement.
The National Monument Office will speak an important word in the historic renovation of the school wall, which has even been used for film footage.
Should there come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the protrists of monuments.
Students of the Bräunlingen elementary school, who are now taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new audiorium, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive Jazz Training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now also taken involved in the ongoing discussions about the future of the Musikhochschulen in Baden-Württemberg.
" I think it's wrong to give up the comprehensive training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart, " said Özdemir, " Stuttgarter News ".
Jazz and classical music go hand in hand at the jazz location of Stuttgart.
In doing doing, Özdemir, who is regarded in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate in the federal elections on 22 September, contradicts the Grün-Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this is accelerating a reorganization of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
The degree in jazz and Pop is then be relocated from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
US Frontier: Supertunnel' for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and United States, ators ators discovered discovered and closed a' super tunnel' for drug smuggling.
According to customs authorities have reported, the more than 500 metre long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks, and an ventilation system.
Three suspects have therefore been arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated.
According to the information, the tunnel had not yet been in use.
" These cartels are stupid when they think they can dig under the radar, " said Southern Laura Duffy, US California Attororney General, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
DuDuffy told the drug gangs:' If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money'.
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in an ongoing fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug-related crime.
Designted by Experts
Due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 metres into the depth to the actual entrance to the tunnel.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimetres in width.
It would thus also have been suited to encouraging illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine contest.
The third, a Mexican, was captured for the confiscated marijuana.
All three face facing life imprisonment as the maximum sentence, as officials have said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, continued at the press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction.
Cocaine is usually smuggled in smaller quantities, not through tunnels.
This is demonstrated by the " despair " of the drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off, Bill Sherman said of the DEA drug search in San Diego.
They would do everything they could to reach the United States.
No details were given of the detainees, at least one is Mexican, they they said.
They can expect prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 ’ s Geisinger Year Year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
A return of the first document mention is coming ever approaching.
When the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks' time, the bianniversary year is coming.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in documents in 794.
A document has been produced in churches mentioning both places.
On 15 March there is to be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen ingen does currently have a hall hall this this ickickoff event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
In the occasion of the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen as well as in church Hausen.
Kirchen-Hausen will the 1250 in July on a festive weekend from July 18th to 20th.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall.
On this festive weekend there is also the Kirchen-Hausener Church festival.
MunicipMusic Director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of its anniversary, which is performed on three dates.
On June 21st together with the Sunday party of the Black Forest Association, on 12 12th in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
It will be ready and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date will be the last weekend of September, 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the city juanniversary the the Geisinger, a new chronicle will also be released.
" But it should not only become a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but also a printed work on the spiritual singing of today, consisting precisely of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen, " says mayor Walter Hengstler.
Today ’ s ghosting singing is also celebrating 2014 ’ s birthday, and in 1974 today ’ s spatial community with its communations was completed.
The new chronicle will be presented on November 21 or 22nd in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Narrzunft straw glonki begins on February 8th with a customs evening on the occasion of its 60th existence, the harmony of Gutmadingen is 90 years and has the banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1st to 4th.
The old tenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this within the framework of the Well festival from 4th to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in documents in 764 in a certificate of donation owned by the St. Gallen Monastery.
The certificate was produced in churches (Hausen), which was then the place of court.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason for celebrating this 1250-year-old accordingly in 2014, also to 40 years since local reform.
Council getes Rail equipment
Should the railway crossing " Am Hirschen " be extensively reconstructed in order to increase road safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach will have to take EUR 220 000 into hand for achieve purpose.
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal line next year.
In particular, it aim is to increase safety at railway crossings - there are regular collisions between trains and other vehicles throughout wide.
If the communities agree to the reconstruction work, they must share one-third of the costs, while the rest share the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's master townbuilder Roland Grießhaber explained the special features of the spa transition " Am Hirschen " to the municipal council.
The city plans to build a bus ge at the tunnel west of the railway tracks.
Larger vehicles, such as those transporting longumber, could also be standing there the case of counter-traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed that a necessary support wall should be designed in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversy in the local council, because some councils questioned the need for street proliferation: Thomas Kipp summed ed up mood mood the critics:' Do we have to take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?'
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The " Hirschen " railway crossing is regularly used for long wood transport.
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is partly transported across this route, because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Häberles brücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route served as a votory for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since it can be able that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and constructed, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the " Am " Hirschen " railway crossing can also be an important importance of transport for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to have an investigation into the cost of the widening of the roads.
Despite this, a majority agreed to the reconstruction of the railway crossing on proviso that the necessary support wall wall be built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstraße " to around 5.5 metres if necessary for meeting traffic.
The reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tbery, on the other hand, could lead to a completely different problem concerning access to the sharply increasing' Geroltzhäuser Weg'.
The administration had had the reconstruction plans of the railways examined by the engineering office Breinlinger, as it doubted as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus weg would then be easily possible.
The study concluded that it cannot be ruled out that the inclination conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles being seated.
The responsibility for this, in turn, lies with the city as a road truck er.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Haas argued, since both wood removal and worked worked in the state of development development one should not agree agree to the reconstruction of the railway crossing.
The risk of the train colliding with a vehicle in the transition is also much lower at this point point than at the other railway ings, because the stop next next it it in the centre, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main train station have have slowslowed down at this point that there is no risk of collision.
According to the Councils, a majority refused refused agree to the reconstruction of this railway crossing, because the city of Schilach would have to " bear the brbrunt " of the problem of vehicles vehicles of the cils, as the railways could withdraw responsibility once the construction work has been completed.
The panel considers the conversions at the " Vor Heubach' and " Vor Kuhbach' railway crossings, for which crossroads agreements have already been reached by rail, to be unproblematic.
Esa Choses Big Space Missions: Missions for Billions
Far planets, waves of gravity or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they intend to launch in the next few years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the race.
Far ent worlds.
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
No one knows whether there are lives in at least some of them.
The choice is difficult: should we search for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for earth-like planets and thus perhaps discover extra-restrial life?
These are the very questions that by those responsible for the European Space Agency, Esa.
For their " Cosmic Vision " programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects which should make a decisive progress in research.
The budget for such' L missions' is around EUR 1 billion.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas have been on the table, five of which have now shortlisted.
Many bodies are reating the proposals and looking up the researchers.
A final decision is to be taken in the next few days by the scientific programme committee.
The Esa has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme, initiated in 2007, will provide answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact processes in forming stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planplanets ing them - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star owns a planet, under what circumstances can life be created there?
To explore this question, the " Cheops " space telescope is to be launched in 2017, which will examine more detail 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity.
The possibilities are limited, however, cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, astronomers could depict earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, thus search for " biomarkers ": gases considered an indicator of biological activity.
How does the Solar System work?
This question, too, should ultimately shed light on the prerequisexist for the creation of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field, as well as its particle radiation with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined as an examples.
With the Solar Orbiter, the Esa has already approved an MM class mission (where the budget is around half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe was due to start in 2017 and would closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to researchers.
You want to find out what role the huge planet has played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa provides for the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision program.
The probe " Juice " (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reached Jupiter and was to investigate the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
Space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature with which we know are still valid there.
There may also be differences that might point physicists the way to a new theory, under which all known laws of nature can be combined.
How did the universe come about and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, the big bang created our cosmos.
In addition to the matter we are familiar with, which makes up stars, planets, and beings like us, there is dark matter whose gravity brings galaxies and clusters together, and dark energy that action accelerates the expansion of space.
So far, researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fraca second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With " Euclid ", the Esa has already approved a M mission, which is scheduled to be launched in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the entire sky, thus allowing conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who Who Could Make the Race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
In the opinion of many experts, the best chances of being approved as an L mission is " E-Lisa ", an ambitious concept for detecting waves of gravity.
This means physicists changes in the structure of spacetime that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
To date, they have not been proven.
Elisa could do this, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission provided a detector consisting of two or three probes, would be stationed in space.
Unlike installations on Earth, it could also demonstrate waves of gravity created by the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called Athena to explore black holes, " Icy Planets, another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, " Prism, " a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the Exoplanet Finder to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
Proposals for the return of samples from Mars, for research into the moon, Venus and asteroids, and for solar physics.
Snowden Reready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblolower of the US intelligence service, has said that he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German estag if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, do not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele, met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss what was said with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin by Ströbele on Friday, he wrote, “ While the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissent as a break of trust, trying to criminalize political expression with the threat of punishment that cannot be defense. ”
But to telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The indictment by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
The German Minister of the Interior, Hans-Peter Friedrich, said to time online: ‘ If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible ’.
Relations between the US and are strained by claims that the NSA has eavcepted Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who chairs the parliamentary intelligence committee, declared that it should seitake the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness if possible, “ without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US. ”
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to former NSA employee Snowden ’ s lawyer, cannot return to Russia if he leaves.
If Snowden testifies in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is “ safe, ” there the Member P says.
Snowden states in his letter that he would be face a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that had driven him out of his homeland.
But it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression. ”
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a common credit.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer authorities to the German authorities “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved. ”
Frontier Airlines charges charges for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 from passengers wishing to store hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to USD 100 for one piece of hand baggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though Wednesday ’ s announcement stated that passengers should keep all the can.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat, and small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier explained that you calculate $25 if the fee is paid in advance and $100 for travellers who only paid at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee is aimed at getting travellers to handle payment beforehand.
“ We don ’ t want to calculate this amount, ” she explained.
Airlines started charging for the first and second items of checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore dumpcked as much as possible into their hand baggage, with the result that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fges are one way of getting passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money.
It was the most loyal customers of Frontier, who would have clearly stated that it would becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers buying their tickets on the airline ’ s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may take one of baggage baggage at the Frontier boarding gate free of charge, but the next person may have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of baggage.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures will be changed so that passengers are aware of the fee before they get to the boarding gate.
The new hand baggage fee ance from Frontier will only enter into force until the summer, with no exact date yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to make use of them.
They argue that transporting the baggage will cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they so wish.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are raising enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them, however, have so far left their fingers of hand baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded as the first charge for hand baggage three years ago, and later Allegitimant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline advisant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitoring the additional charges.
He estimated in a report in December 2011 that the hand baggage fee Spirit would raise USD 50 million a year.
Sorensen, who used to hold a leading position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what would expect from the boarding gate if passengers were faced with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage fee.
“ The boarding process has been one of the smoothsmooth I have experienced in my career in aviation, ” he said.
I expected to see the kneading of teeth and tangible discussions on the boarding gate.
‘ The plane was full, ’ he said, ‘ and boarding went like lubricated. ”
Frontier also follows Spirit on the $2 required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company declared that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep all the can and be replenished for free.
Water is still free of charge.
US Airways had briefly tried to ask for money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had followed suit.
Frontier's step to charge for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz pay $25 25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to encourage passengers to buy directly from them, rather than via an online travel agency.
Frontier, tier, has gone furthest in this area.
In September, the company began allocding only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, miles were cut once again to 25% of the flight.
A flight with Frontier for more than 1000 miles booked with a third party provider will earns customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at Denver based, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenues decreased by 9 percent and flight capacity shrted just under 13% in the first quarter, as can be seen in the financial report published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get to grips with Frontier's finances through the sale of society.
Sverbis Coming from the Bible
More than 40 women attended the last women's breakfast of this year in the Protestant community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the Municipal House was " proverbis from the Bible " and " Middle phrases ".
Zita Köhler, Chairman of the Church Council, spoke to bibibproververbals in a lecture after breakfast.
" Proverbials contain life wisdom, regulations or warnings, " she explained.
She compared several proverbis to the corresponding Bible and explained the meaning.
She called proverbials such as: wooden eye is vigilant as scales fall off the eyes, keep an eye on someone whom the Lord gives himself when he sleep, wash his hands of it.
On several occasions, the speaker also advised her listeners what proverb they was.
The phrases from the Middle Ages were eched by the parish counilleper Christel Dehner: all good things are three, make blue, a little thaded away.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called' bridges to the past'.

Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for the unskilled in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is launched at the Mecklenburg Seenplatte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 men and women who already work as unskilled people in the industry are to be qualified as specialists for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
" What is new that the six-month courses end with diplomas, " said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are manifold: it would not make the participants unemployed, the would would receive skilled workers, who were increasingly absent in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Commerce in Neuin enburg and and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are also involved in the project.
NSA declares that an “ internal error, ” not hackers, are to blame for the Web site crash.
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late in Friday that a error had paralysed its public website for several hours, not hackers, as was claimed online.
“ NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update, ” explained the sponage agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and that some users still still not so.
Previously, a NSA spokesman had told ABC News that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised.
Secret information is not in end,, the speaker says.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple, and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the target system ’ s internal network.
The formerly super-secret NSA, once nicknamed as No Such Agency, is now itself in the public light, and is severely criticized following revelations in recent months about its extensive domestic and international surveillance program – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of targeted cycle operation.
The number of people without jobs fell slightly by 22 to 1,307 in October.
Although the rate is better at 3.1% than last year and also better than in September, " we would have hoped for more, " says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy CEO of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Many farms have so far reacted cautiously when it comes to hiring.
According to the Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: " We have hardly any professionals in the crafts, health care and care for the elderly ".
Due to the annual seasons, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been received again.
The winter season starts there in the middle of December.
The entire background report can be found in the Allgäu ad sheet dated 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Loss of profit Bomloss didifollowing following decrease in deliveries and orders
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc., reported a 15% decrease in net profit on Thursday, coming under pressure from declining orders and deliveries for third-quarter aircraft as well as rail contract problems.
Montreal based Bombardier also did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did any provide new information on whether the aircraft could be used commercially next September in accordance with the ambitious timetable.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago ago so been followed by only three more take-off, which gives it doubtful whether the test phase is proceeding as planned.
The results fell short of forecasts, leading to a crash of more than 8% of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron cans, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation from “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” on Thursday in in view the ensure that share share has limited price potential for the next one or two quarters.
“ Although weaker deliveries for aircraft expected to as largely as possible, we are clearly disappointed by the trend in margin in the transport sector, ” said cans in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft test programme progresses.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries series will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and, after months of delays, flew for the first time in September.
But so far far binding binding orders for the CSeries have moderate, at 177, as potential buyers wait for the results results of the flight tests to see if the company ’ s claims about fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet aircraft are correct.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the management also assured analysts and the media that the programme was on schedule.
“ The test aircraft has not stay on the ground for longer than expected, ” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates had been planned during the aircraft ’ s service life.
Each manufacturer plans a different plan.
We have decided to make a first flight and then to add a review period, which we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight programme.
The second in five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, while the remaining shortly afterwards, according to the company.
Yet, analystremain remain tical as to whether whether 12 months months the maiden flight, the first customer be able able, 12 months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier explained it is reviewing the commissioning planning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even though it obviously correspond to Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015, ” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share of $172 million, or 9 cents per share the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share remains changed changed 9 cents.
Sales fell slightly, falling from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims to have delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a 57 decline last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order book in the aerospace sector was $32.9 billion on September 30, remaining December 31.
“ In the aerospace sector, results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing, ” said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have increased by just under 11% to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on September 30, slightly higher from December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems with some large contracts.
According to corporate governance, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trading on Thursday, the Bombardier ’ s share fell by 8.5% to $4.83 Canadian, after it was also been announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette will join the Executive Board.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardian ’ s narrowest rival, announced a 10% decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.

Cocaine addict lawyer who warned drug boss of police investigation must be go jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed information to Underworld Size NNeil Scarborough
The lawyer Feed that his Secestt Drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced by Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison prison
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because fearafraid that his secret drug addiction might be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld NNeil Scarborough sensitive information about investigations into his activities in drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The, haised by criminals as “ first class ” lawyer nicknamed “ Bash, ” was arrested in his house in 2011, after the police overvised Scarborough, whom he represented in a previous drug case.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) delivering three bags of cocaine at the lawyer ’ s house in Blackburn, ancanchire, while he was at the bar with colleagues with colleagues.
The investigation showed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Over an eight-period between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after the police provided £1.5 million in heroin and cocaine and £200,000 in cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because feared that his drug addiction could be published.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two charges for obting justice.
He admitted cocaine ownership in a previous survey.
The lawyer was convicted after the police found their investigation into Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Dittitt’ s house and put drugs under the lawyer ’ s dustbin with 60% purity in a black f glove.
Shortly after supplying the drugs, Scarborough regularly teleped Ditta, who at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, collected the drugs, and then nine notifications were exchanged between the two.
It court became known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests revealed Class A drugs in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that her discussion was subject to legal secrecy. ”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a sample of hair was taken from him.
During the police interinterrogation, he stated that he operated an office both at his private address and in the workplace, and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It became known before the court that he had called key players in the drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “ A criminal law lawyer should know better than anyone that you don ’ t break the law. ”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker, but of a drug trafficker who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the advocate for these people.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed any misconduct, claiming, “ If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but would so immediately. ”
But, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said, “ Mr Ditta moved from a criminal defender to a criminal when he began buying drugs from organized criminals. ”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime who instructed him with obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed that trust and has tried to hide behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also resulted to a conviction in three cases for owning cocaine and impairing justice, which underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of plot to trade in heroin, cocaine, and cannabis.
Thirty-five other' people involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, in which he claimed that his dream job was to represent clients on death row row as a lawyer, that his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and that inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.

Hazlach: Skepticism is way rise ingly in confidence
The elections to the parish Council in 2015 will change fundamental, will change fundamental, in the lalaParpastcare Unit (SE).
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
The basic decisions of the diocese remain unchanged and it is up to the parish community counto implement implement as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear: skepticism about the new gives way to reluctantly but increasingly confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions between the bodies ranged with the main officials of the Soupastor team.
Regional dekan Georg Schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation the newly designed guidelines for minicare units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
According to this, the SE Haslach, as a church community will henceforth form a body under public law that accaccup into the rights and obligations of the previously six individual church communities.
There will only be one joint parish council and one board of trustees on which the priest force of office will be represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and so-called community teams are to be made formed in the six parishes.
Their task in the future will be to promote ecclesiastical life in the place.
The question of the finances of the individual parish then revealed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations require for the accumulated funds in the parish ishes be earearpurposes.
By contrast, liabilities are to the community the entire whole.
There were particularly concerns about the large investments planned planned, the commitment of which then affects all parishes.
" In the past, too, investments have only been made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone, " says Haslach's chairman of the parish council Bruno Prinzbach, relrelative.
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parishes described described Barbarian Knights, Chairman of the panel of the Schutterwald-Neuried Soueland Unit.
In 2006, they set themselves the task of' becoming one, remaining five' and found that it was not at all easy.
The bodies of the Haslach Soustry Unit then set out to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams.
The work will be fleshed out in subsequent meetings and will be adopted at a further joint meeting of all six fora next spring.
In the end, the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Paststry Unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is becoming more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the Managing Director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a four-person Pfullendorfer family will urs urs between 70 and 90 additional costs per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This levy is set every year in October by the four operators of the large power lines.
These quantify the additional costs incurred as a result of the change in energy, which they can levcharge above the price of electricity by means of a levy.
The Pfullendorf Stadtwerke form the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
The concrete figures would now have to be calculated before Stadtwerke could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
" We are assuming an increase of 1 cent plus x, " says Bias, with the figure closer to the 2 cents.
Permanent Red Trafflight lights: Watch Waiting
Sometimes a traffic light simply does not become green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light is defective.
What should we do then - drive with red?
If a person concerned has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad ".
However, the waiting time must be " appropriate ", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises you sting for at least five minutes before assuming traffic light function.
If you continue the journey red light, however, you must be aware that you are fully to blame for an accident caused by it.
Those who wait less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warn Becker and refer to a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent violation of red light.
The traffic lights were not broken, but jumped over to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the particular situation - but not the fine.
The Local Council welcomes the Sound Budget
Whenever the budget at involved in local council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has good laulaugh.
The parish bakery in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not been known to the administration since 2005.
In this respect, the 2012 financial year can also be regarded as a complete success.
This became clear when we presented the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget, at around EUR 7.6 million of over EUR 1 million, was higher than planned.
The administrative budget surplus, at around EUR 1.8 million, is also around EUR 1 million higher than the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher industrial tax revenues and the local share of income tax.
The asset budget, too, was again well above the planned levels.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
" This is essentially due to the increased allocation from the administrative budget, " says Rothmund.
Since less investment were made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the deposit have also been higher.
In total, the general reserve has been increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
" You don't just shake such a work out of slesleeve, " praised Barised with regard to the annual accounts.
He and the local councils were obviously rejoiced at the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the community was able to do without high rates of leverage in the past.
According to Barto, however, subsidies from the country have often been cut as a result.
There conditions in place for these subsidies from various compensatory sticks.
Amongst other things, the towns and communities applying for subsidies must present certain leleverage.
" We need to look at the issue of leverage, as there are facing investments in the coming years for which we would like to see subsidies, " Gerster announced in this context.

He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased, because it is an extended arm of the government, ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy.
‘ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament, ’ he said.
According to The Star, the government is “ effectively strangling the media through the new law, whereas The Standard writes that Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya have “ dealt a severe blow, ” calling the it “ draconian. ”
The passage of the law is one of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the West Gate Shopping Centre in September.

The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “ just one penalty can bankrupt most radio stations. ”
Moreover, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a damning effect on what Kenya ’ s “ vibrant blogosphere. ”
If they siced the media, politicians could do whatever they like with impunity.
“ No one will ever know, ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation who describes the Kenyan media as a decisive factor in control public life.
“ If politicians are left to your devices, lead the country into bankruptcy, and us back to the days of hunters and collectors, ” he commented.
Kenyan legislators have already incited public anger in the past.

Both have been rejected again.
Six years ago, ideas arose about setting creation an artificial turf sports field, which was widely regarded as the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were started two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erblecht, promised to share the costs of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and the country approved subsidies of EUR 104 000.
The local council decided in October 2012 to cover the remaining EUR 356 000 in the total cost of EUR 560 000, summarized Klumpp.

UN UN announdNew Targets in PoPoty ty duction
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, which were announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro this evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ sustainable Development Goals ” to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expire in 2015.
They have been included in the final draft document that will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared at the summit this evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests. ”
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to initiate a process with which universal, sustainable development goals are to be agreed, ” he said.
“ These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the Millennium Development Goals. ”

Everyone remains fully motivated in this matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
" Because I don't know how such a victory tastes any more, " Malmon expects his team to succeed at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Although FreFredenbeck s third-party reserve has not yet demoled down trees, Malmon is raising the finger beforehand.
I have trained many players myself in the A-Jugend.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
" It also also to to if there is is any any reinforcement from the first, " explains the SG coach.
In order finally finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must increase compared to previous performances.
Above all, there was a huge lack in the cover work and the game switch switch.
The utilisation of opportunities must definitely definitely be improved.
So I hope that my players have finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique in in the face of clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputa, under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president Mozambique, to join peace calls in a rare public demonstration.
“ We want peace again, we want stability, ” said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, it exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt labelled ‘ We demand security ’ in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital ’ s Independence Square on Thursday.
For the last two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notfamous rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia, and then by the the apartheid government of South Africa in trying to destabilize the country ’ s independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and natives.
The stakes for the fast-growing economy are high, because discovery of vast offshore gas resources and coal deposits in the northwest could bring investments of more than $50 billion in the coming years from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Anadarko of the US.
The ruling Frelim party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blames each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamos stronghold, on 17 October.
Attaults on the former rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renami bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group ’ s leader, said told Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organisation of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play play concerns about instability.
WASHINGTON (AFP), US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday denounced the use of cluster munitions in the war in Afghanistan.
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have intensiincreased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo has giving up the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT by this he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations, ” said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
“ We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide heads, ” says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is well at negotiated and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, pressing for electoral reform, has already declared that it will boycott November ’ s local elections.
Presidential and legislative elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renmember MomenmenDemocráático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – who is due to resign if his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy.
“ He doesn ’ t want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency, ” says zanganga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South link.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but which is located to Beira, the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended use of the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded cautiously to ask whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique, ” Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people are already concerned about corruption, slow progress progress development development, and a recent wave of kidnapping.
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future and that he should be the one who find solutions to the problems, ” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people simply wanted stability.
“ nobody are interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again, ” he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ role models for life, ” one author says.
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks, ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
But many of the myths are “ far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools, ” is why Crossley Holland called for a “ careful selection ” of age-aged works.
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America, ” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that children are “ completely shut off ” in authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic ” ” because in entertaining stories, the messages are “ subliminal. ”
Crossley Holland, which has translated Beowulf from Angloaxaxon and the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Valley, said, “ You can have certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background far far possible. ”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil.
It must be subliminal, revereveals history, not explain it.
This is the old story of showing rather than telling.

Shrill Piepses rupbs Residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships over the stockpile.
The company has several irons in the fire at its site.
In addition to coal glue transport, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind bines logistics.
Black coal shimmers in the storage site in front of the dike.
Two huge blue stockpile and unloading devices distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every time time the shipment are move, a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
" The signals serve security and are required by law, " says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, wind wind is favorable, this can unfortunately widely widely - - so there have already been some complaints from people from the city order.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close cooperation with the authorities, the warning signals are now being kept eter quimeans with technical measures.
He will continue to rely on open dialogue with its neighbours.
Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do of it.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal glue exports for power plants and is one of the major players in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the suntub in front of the terminal, which is deepened to 18.5 metres, capesize bulk carriers can long since be handled here.
" This year we want to crack the 3 million ton mark in the envelope, " says Schrell.
In addition to the local eye power plant, imported coal goes to inland power stations.
Add to that the GDF Suez power plant goes on the grid grid and a good 5 million tonnes of coal glue imports a year would be realistic.
The three unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bavaria ’ s Basketball Player Optimism, Despite First Defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the enormous optimism of the basketball players of the FC Bayern Munich.

Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: barely a hundred years ago, the varietal artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd jokes directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays innovation has expanded, as did most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of Caroline ’ stand-up institution, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“ Most of these headliners started with Carolines and became more and more successful until they were eventually too known to perform in a club, ” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
This year ’ s event will feature performed by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy charity event for army evetres in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world has also grown into comedy.
A number of comedians who will be taking part in this festival this festival have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as shows on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic slippery fantasy football series “ The League ” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both Saturday Night Live and “ Parks and Recreation ”, although she is best known for her viral video series “ Marcel the Shell with Shoes On ”.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic racial focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the greatest visitors of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a television show entitled “ Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg ” at TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“ The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry ’ s all work, ” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he is here, he sometimes walks through the alleybetween two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, I may be living here.
Iran Satisfied with Nuclear Negotiations Process
One week before the next nuclear meeting, Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
" After years, an agreement has now been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years, " Foreign Minister Mohamed Javad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
There would still be a long way to go, the nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that both sides will ultimately be found to a solution.
Uruguay Drama: Boys Kill y mates with Machete
Two children admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 year-old boys had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they astonned the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper " El País " on Thursday.
They would then have played football in front of their homes in a working-class district.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 km north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the young person, who had taken her with her, was supposed to testify that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the course of events in front of the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As the reasons, the elderly cited, among other things, a rivalry in football matches.
He was provisionbeing admitted to a psychiatric youth institution.
Pimps MPPon
The District Court of Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison for exploitative trafficking in human beings, pimping, threat, insult and dangerous bodily injury.
The former German military soldier, who worked as a door stand after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession in a legal agreement.
In five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent out off against against will after a few weeks.
He used to break down with force and threats.
He retained the income of women, some of whom had earned for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he subordinated contacts between contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly supervised in order to control their revenues.
In court, the accused first claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues died in an explosion in Afghanistan next to him.
After a psychiatric expert suggested serious doubts about mental constraint, and thus about limited guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the women women.
As one krio official reported, at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking in human beings have been identified after initial notification by means of telephone surveillance.
The avcepapped talks were marked by a great aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered blue spots on the whole body, had yet made no statement.
He is' a completely broken person' who considers violence and exploitation in this profession as normal.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
" He has dissocihimself from these circles and wants to lead a normal life after detention, " he said.
Oil prices continues to down as up as USD 96 a barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference wood variety for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange in electronic commerce in this late morning to USD 96.24 a barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price fall of 5.8% in October.
The large supply of raw oil has weighed down prices in recent weeks.
On Wednesday, the US Department of Energy declared that the US offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were indications of increased demand through two reports of increased activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This suggests a continued recovery in China ’ s economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8% in the third quarter, having reached its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude oil, a reference value for international crude also used by US refineries, fell 26 cents on the ICE Exchange in London to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD's stop and risk D
On Thursday, a federal Appecourt in the US blocked the order of a judge calling for changes to the stop -and-risk program (“ stopping and searching ”) of the New York police department and released the judge from the case.
The second US Court of Appeal declared that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended until an appointment appointment of city decision has been taken.
The judge had ruled in August that the city was violating the constitution with the way in which the program for stopping and intertioning people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies requested, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police amending their directive and training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard Tuesday Tuesday the arguments concerning the requested suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge must be relieved because she had ached the Code of Conduct for US judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the semblance of partisanship, partly due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which she responded publicly to the Court ’ s criticism.
The judge had judged that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were unduly targeting black and Latin American men with the stop -and-risk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms to policies, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot programme with body-carrying cameras in neighborhoods where most checks were carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice practice of storing the names and addresses of people dismissed after police checks.
An oral hearing to appointment of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop -and-risk tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
Such controls have been in place in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the tenure of non-partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, who belonging to all minorities, filed a complaint, which became a collective redress.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop -and-risk program say that the changes will end unfair practices, create a more trustworthy and effective police force, and influence the way other police dencies use the regulation.
Opponents believe that the change would dampen police morality, not crime; it will waste money and it will not solve the broader problem of a police force that under pressure following the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not put an end to the stop -and-risk practice, which is constitutional, but only reformed the way in which the NYPD implemented controls.
The Happiness of Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an Oasis that only dreaming camels can achieve reached
With this Bedououin wisdom, the first chairman, Wolfgang Henne, described the history and fascination of the " Helfende Hands " association.
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first chairman, Mr Henne, reported extensively about the work of the association.
He himself was first in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk Zajed-hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on the ground during several journeys.
During the speeches, pictures of the assignakes were shown on a big screen so that the guests of the jubilee event could see for themselves the aformentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former federal Border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans to act as a advisory role with the association, according to Henne.
In 2008, the carpei Schleeh from Baiersbronn built the sickbay in Socogim, a slums on the edge of the capital, in a record time of almost a week - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new Mother-Child Hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the maternity clinic in Nagold is to be nationalised.
There is learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, Henne says, for example, sastation against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but for this, many doctors came to Germany to express themselves in various areas.
Containers containing material are also regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, bandmaterials, hospital beds and glasses in March of this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered plenty of local colour by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a a mobile briat stable and describing the experiences of the native musicians, who traditionally supported the club, during their trip to Mauritania.
As his personal motives he mentioned his work in the field of auditing as a young MEP.
When he realised how much money had been lost on the way, he decided to help the Africans popular control of a budget.
Fuchtel also emphasized that the global economy also demands global love of beings.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip.
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “ telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip about an affair by then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Court in the Old Bailey News News the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser, ” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack and followed uted Pawlby's voice emails, but Coulson also called them and left behind news as the Court learned.
“ According to the public prosecutor ’ s office, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is not one one front front people people ’ s homes and hopes to catch them for fresh action, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction, ” Edis explained.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigatively investigate stories: telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the monitoring, and it cannot be otherwise.
What about the first?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He denies that, but we say, “ And whether he knew about it. ”
Rumors of Clare ’ s affair were first picked up by NotW ’ s feature editorial staff, when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was said, “ Don ’ t waste your time, it ’ s with Charles. ”
A band with voice emails from their phone of at least three occasions was seized in August 2006 in Mulcaires's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective ’ s computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects. ”
When the time was was under way, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, explained Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw monitoring Pawlby ’ s movements.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her with a voicemail with the following content: “ I have a story that we want to publish tomorrow tomorrow which I would like to talk to Charles. ”
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other key figures, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had confronted a married woman for an affair, when he himself had lifted with the co-accused of RebekBrooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny to have conspired to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.
Indeed, in protest against the planned empire tax, French football will go through the first strike since 1972.
A mediation ation meeting is coming to an end without results.
In the empire tax the conflict, the government and professional football in France have manoeuvred themselves into an impasse following a failed arbitration meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of associations and associations at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday, and also listened to their complaints.
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75% levy on income of more than €1 million per year, which all the country ’ s firms are supposed to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained firm.
According to Jean-Pierre Louvel, Head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), the strike announced for the end of November will now also be through.
The days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, scheduled between 29 November and 2 December are thus abcancelled.
Geching: No Absolute Protection
" We want to involve the inhabitants in planning at an early stage, " mayor Jens Häußler, opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Some 80 participants had come to the local hall to explain the measures measures, ask questions, express concerns and submit ideas.
Häußler made it clear:' The final decisions are taken by the members of the local council'.
The floods that hit Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009 were a dramatic event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, according to Häußler.
A river basin study had been commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
" The goal is to protect as many cultivated ated land as possible, " says Häußler.
The basis is the planning of protection against floods floods that are statistically expected every 100 years, according to the German weather service.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In experts this is known as " HQ 100aKlima ".
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1000 year flood.
" There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement, " says Häusler.
In order to protect the HQ 100a climate, investments of around four million euros have to be made in Gechingen, with the municipality able to expect state subsidies of around 70%.
However, Häußler pointed out that conveytion only exists if an overall concept is implemented.
To this end, the community needs the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval procedure must be completed.
At best, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) provides for local measures in the infbutx of the river Irm from the Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants advantage of the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Amongst other things, questions has been asked to why more dams and reservoirs are not planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the contracted engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interplay of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal.
Moreover, according to Joachim Forest of Wald and Corbe, the most economical solution is to be found.
There was resentment among people surrounding the old, who suffer from overload on the channel net, even in normal thunderstorms.
The problem is well known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for canal systems were different from those for flood prevention and that this should not be confused.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that two to three years of rainy events could be overcome.
Larger the size of the sewers would devour millions.
Seriously Wounded After Clision
In the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a head-on collision on the road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but initially had little to say about the outcome of the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should first be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old steering er of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so heavily trapped that it took the fire brigade half an hour to free her from the vehicle wrek.
The actual cause of the accident remained unresolved at first.
Both injured came to nearby hospitals.
The track remained fully closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostoevsky of the US.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysicist, his novels and narratives also have something serious.
Amazing is the relationship on the the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fydor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive oeuvre, can be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who is valid at home.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, and the Haffmans cassette with its 118 stories distridistributes two thousand.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, obsession with security, and the belief that you are chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, had added drugs to his brain.
He understood, early on, that the computers are divinties.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a human being from a machine the Creator from his creation.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
Kkilling.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The " Minority Report " dates back to 1956 and exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals.
The principle of' pre-crime ",' pre-crime', is being developed here, in other words what has become more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dk's world, frighteningly like ours, mutants look to the future - and the police are approaching.
" We are turing individuals who have not broken any law, " says the head of the authority.
'We grnatch up before they can commit a violent crime'.
And:' There are no serious criminals in our society, but we have a criminal camp full of pesudo criminals', you read flows of time.
They assume that the worst is happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Thk ’ s narrative looks like the blueprint for anti-terrorism laws and the NSA ’ s eavesdrodropping.
Anticipation of the attack: that is how Obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Thk ’ s story is not yet over.
The head of police complains that there is no longer any separation of powers, that the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system rotturning through.
It is perfect, but it is lying.
It invents its own conditions.
Not only accept errors and victims, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it combats.
Read Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth time and again.
Russia ’ s Testifying al about Merkel
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements about his Russian asylum in the Chancellor Angela Merkel Merkel s US late affair.
Representatives of the German Federal Bar Office could either ask questions in writing or also meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, reported the Interfax agency.
Prethat, Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to discuss the affair with him.
NSA Revvelations reinforce corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany ’ s financial capital.
At the orders of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Home ior Intelligence Service, he was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas, and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German State Department in Berlin.
James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the US did not use foreign espionage “ to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profits. ”
But, since Edward Snowden, a became a whistleblowers, began publishing his founp horn of US surveillance sec,, European governments and business leaders have no longer been sure that they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has sped on Brazil ’ s oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company ’ s paranoia to a new high over government surveillance.
The camel's back broken the revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone was woven, perhaps for a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then management are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
“ Germany must wake up, ” explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now poses almost as great a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting EY.
But there has been no evidence in the documents leaked by Snowden that the US has passed passed the business secsecrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Businesses are sceptical about this.
It was suggested in the Bundestag that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
“ That ’ s not how it works, ” says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If we had wanted a strong European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT sector.
Yet the reach and technical subtlety of the US spy authorities uncovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen China ’ s greatest risk of spying.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing, because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurisdiction there and is therefore potentially endrisk.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, revelations about US data mining activities with Prism rejected about 10% of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy CEO of SAP, says, “ We see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago – it is: where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that it remain physically in this judicial area? ”
Many German business leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and must therefore be guarded at all costs.
It is no surprise that economic espionage is taking place.
This has always been the case.
“ It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed as a result of the current discussion, ” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate governance do not usually boast about the remedies that have been taken, because that brings benefits to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been told that it is not advisable to take a free USB stick at a trade fair or leave a laptop unattended in the hotel room, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of directors at car manufacturer Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years collecting collecting phones before a board board meeting, so that they cannot be used as interavception devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
“ Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, human resources and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorised access, ” warns the BVT in a report.
The US warns its own firms against other countries ’ industrial espionage.
According to the Washington Post, in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia, and Israel were ranked second of the countries used to obtain economic data for the hacking behind China.
A member of the board of directors of a blue chip company agreed that when it comes to business espionage, “ the French are the worst. ”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France ’ s interior Intelligence Service (DCRL), was quoted in an interview this month as saying “ The intelligence services know full well that even if all countries work together to fight terrorism, they spy on their allies. ”

Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled Ringer mat in his high school gym gym, are convinced that their son was murdered, said the family ’ s lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a upright mat behind the gallery in the Schulturture Hall.
Johnson was born in Lowndes, Massachusetts.
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered, ” explained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed he had died as the sheriff concluded.
“ They believe that there is no logic in violating the laws of physics as well as common sense, ” Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will being covered up in order to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son.
“ Your son went to school to learn and came back in a body bag, ” he comments.
US Public Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into Johnson ’ death death because a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My aim is to find out the truth.
“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation, ” he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggested that Johnson had died as a result of “ positioning suffocation. ”
But a second autopsy had revealed another cause of death, Moore argued.
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed, ” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson ’ s death, he would ask the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the authority of County Sheriff was not immediately prepared to comment on Thursday at our request.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities to release all the surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The teenager ’ s parents said that they hoped that the video recordings contained contain indication of how he died.
CDC publishes Allergic tives for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for the treatment of food allergies among children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines that the US government has issued, as the number of children who food allergies to use food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now have a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information on schools to raise awareness of food allergies among faculty and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin in stock – EpiPen auto injection is most commonly used – to counter a potentially lethal hypersensitivity reaction.
State legislators have recently amended rules to make schools to keep epinephrin in stock more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, ‘ It feels as if something is pressing on my tongue ’, ‘ My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it ’ or ‘ My tongue crackling ’.
Parents of Intersexual Children Can Chote “ Gender inate ”
Germany is the first European nation to recognize recognize a third sex for children born with unclear genitals.
Newborn babies are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer need to declare sex for such children, but can indicate “ indeterminate ” or “ not fixed ” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to ease pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on gender-allocation operations in newborn born ies and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
Yyears later, according to the BBC, one intersexual person said, “ I am neither man nor woman. ”
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is not born each year as boys or girls.
They include intersexual, a group diagnosed by “ Sexual Differation Disorder ” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles), or unusually developed genitals.
Valais Simpson may have been intersexual.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US recommend using the best available information to algn gender if a provision is not possible, rather than waiting for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before opting, if any, to an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “ sounds like a good thing. ”
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but do not not most children, ” he said.
You can assign sexually without surgery and then wait how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity at all are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it is happening.
It is like the secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission stated that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender--based, but is based to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both simultaneously or clearly defined as one.
These characteristics were reflected in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in chromosomstructures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender persons in working life, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who do not correspond to the gender image now have a special camp.
It is now possible for adults, in Australia and to to indicate the male, female, or “ third sex ” on official documents.
In June, Australians Norrie May-Welby (52) were recognized as the world ’ s first “ genderless ” person after a court granted “ undefined ” gender status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German identity cards will in future have a third assignments, X for intersexual.
Gender issues remain controversial in neighboring France, according to a news in France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “ gender theory ” from textbooks.
The US Catholic Online website also opposed German law on the grounds that “ If the world is dragged into a new state, where gender is a decision, but sexual activity is not, we distort two more pillars of civilization. ”
The mother of a newborn child from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would be better if babies to be assigned a sex at birth.
“ Parental enthood is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your child, ” she said the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes have been called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god, who had both sexes.
Only ten years ago, medicine regarded gender as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But now that we know how complex the gender identity is, the ethical ethical of of operation operation are being into question question that doctors can also be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when it grow up with the sex they assigned.
“ In the mid-twentieth century, the one was called a “ psychiatric emergency, ” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist who was called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about treatment treatment of genital children goes back from Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender was formable.
He coined the term “ gender identity, ” arguing that social and environmental initiatives – as parents bring up a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones, shaping whether a person considered himself male or female.
But his the1966 case controversial as “ John / Joan, ” his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of transformation, which it was not, ” Drescher says.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male and married a woman.
At the age of 38, however, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practise this model.
But, in the 1990 ’ s, with the Internet ’ the Internet, survivors of these operations came out, who are “ unhappy with the outcome. ”
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
Doctors were unclear whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man.
So, shortly after birth in 1976, his external organ and testicles were surgically removed and he brought up as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
“ I knew I ’ m not a girl, ” he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he was to be given a vaginal plastic.
But having been depressed and knowing that something was wrong, he demanded his medical files.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one has ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genita.
After learning the truth, he returned to a male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The operation has made it infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to make intersexual people perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the California-based Advocates for Informed Choice legal group, worries that German law may “ encourage stamping and stigmatisation. ”
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision might encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign them to the child “ undetermined, ” she explained.
We fear that this encourages intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we do not yet know what the impact of the law will be, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law, because “ it allows adults to be recognized as the third sex. ”
“ Adults should be able to make their own choices about their legal sex, ” she declared.
German law is about assignlocment at birth.
This is not a fight that young children should be forced into fight at this stage.
Once they have grown up, they can decide for themselves on own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brudiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that German law “ authorpowers ” both parents and children.
Katie, daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Due to the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie 29 is married and married she works as a member of child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to have a child through adoption or surrogate mother.
“ The law gives room for parents, so they do not have to rush to decisions, ” Baratz atz.
It gives them the time to do various tests and clarify matters, giving them time before writing “ male ” or “ female. ”
In this way, everything is fine – you pull the child up and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy parental happiness.
And you do not have to rush into an operation that is no be undone.
“ This includes the children in the decision and remoels the fear that griries parents because they do not believe they are doing the right thing, ” she explained.
At the end of the day, it is the child who decides the sex that suits him or her better – and that ’ s wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own decisions.
Unknown injure Girls by Shooting from Car
Ununknown people have injured a twelve year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in bullets from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired an air pressure at a group of children in excellence on Thursday evening.
The police in Burg told us this.
The girl was slightly injured by the left wbath.
Rescue services took the girl to hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
One disc broke.
They then drove away.
The criminal police are investigating, they said on Friday.
To date, the Kempten police inspection can look back on a quiet halloween night.
Officials were only called twice for children to be mature and threw them against facades of the houses.
Since the homeowners recognized this in good time and removed the egg nremains immediately, no material damage should have been caused.
In addition, some New Year's Eve emllers have probably been lit in the city area, but here, too, no material damage has been done.
A resident in the Bishop Friorfer Way reported that his car was wrapped with knock paper and his radar apertures were stolen.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found all his radar apertures in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not need to take any to action.
Living with a future future
Waltraud Ries actually lives drefully.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
" You you're not afraid of spiders? " asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for quite some time.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern that the many steps to the house and the apartment will not longer longer be cope, she explains.
Moreover, since a Meniscus operation, the mid-fifties has experienced for herself what it means to move handicap from floor to cap.
She recently published published a book about' Happy living in old age - which form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is't possible in old age,' she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the duplex apartment more than 20 years ago, it was simply a beautiful apartment surrounded by greenery.
Today, at the middle of fifty Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
She also knows, however, that she is one of the few people who are even concerned with the issue of old age living.
Most people squit out as long as possible.
Only the others always always always siling,' she says.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great can we think.
" Then it can be too late, " RiRies.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for a self-determined living in old age.
" But which form of residence to choose is always an individual decision, " she explains.
D i e solution is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford the age retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also become ill.
And:' Without a good knowledge of the local language, you can also be united in the Dolce Vita', the specialist book author that those willing to emigrate.
Among her models you will find classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the oft-cited pensioner er-toilG.
In Old age, Everyone has their own Tks and Macks
'For me, such a cohabhome would be nothing,' she says with a wink.
Certainly not like in a student toilet with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
" In old age you just need your refurooms, " Ries said.
However, the author of the book does not want to rule out the possibility of a senior citizens' community can still work.
But that should then be different from that in the classical student labour Association.
And sometimes you just want to calm,' she believes.
She is not alone in this view, at least in the capital of the country.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own homes as long as possible,' is also the experience of Theresa Cabütten, the head of civic service of life at the age of the state capital.
Your services advise people on the subject of becoming getting elderly'.
That is why older people in particular would often accept inconveniences and restrictions only to be able to stay in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
Today, however there are many possibilities to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends to those who are involved in the age renovation of their house or apartment to obtain a thorough information first and not hire the first best craftsman.
Today, there are specialists specialists the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rented flat one thing or two can be realized, and if it is only an increase in the toilet seat, the interior architect will clarify.
But not always can the existing apartment be redesigned to to age and thus barrier-free,, how beautiful it may be.
Waltraud Ries had this experience.
The room was very small and the bathroom was very small.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she is horrified than before the spider at her home door.
The US Wto prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its attitude on former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of having passed secret information without lawlawfully.
So, US State Department spokesman Jennifer Psaki said in Washington, he has to face criminal proceedings in the US.
Nor would Snowden ’ s recent statements change that.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US not to punish him any further.
Psaki emphasized that fluent statements were that of a Member of parliament, not that of a German member of the government.
Edward Snowden is a secret service lawyer, is ready to talk to the German authorities.
First of all, however, he wants his situation to be clarified.
The former NSA employee, who sought sought by the USA made this clear in an unaddressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwaron to the federal government, the Bundestag and the federal attorney.
After a translation propagseminby Ströbele, the letter has the following wording:
To those Responsible
I have been asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I have previously been employed by contract or direct technical technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my work in these institutions, I have witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I have been faced with a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I am currently in exile and enjoy the temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance to political actions, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is accountable to no one as a public service.
These espionage revelations brought with it many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously covert abuse of public confidence.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear and, at the same time, the risks taken have been clearly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a cruush of trust and seeks to criminalise and indicute political expression.
Nevertheless, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this harmful attitude.
I hope that, once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and in accordance with the in the responsible responsible clarification concerning what is said in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to meeting to you in your country once the situation has is clarified and I thank you for your efforts to comply with the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies by Hans-Christian Ströbele

Report: Obama Campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Mark Halperin and John Heilemann ’ s long-awaited work on the 2012 Double Down: Game Change 2012. ”
The Times has a copy of the upcoming book, and it reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had held “ extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011 ” to see out whether things look better for Obama ’ s dwindling hope of re-election to drop beden.
According to Jonathan Martin, Times correspondent on National politics, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House officials, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact on the poll figures of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for Vice-President.
The potential change was a tightly guarded secret in the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley, Obama ’ s former campaign leader, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod, and David Plouffe – knew of the envisaged change.
In “ double down, ” it is claimed that had ey been at the forefront of efforts to exchange biden, despite their “ close personal relationship, ” before finally opting to to such a move, after data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances. ”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“ I said a lot of things to consider, and that was one of them, ” Daley explained to the magazine.
It is important to alling that the president had terrible polpoll values at the time, so we thought, “ For God ’ s sake, what do we do? ”
While Daley described the investigations as “ due diligence, ” Martin told CNN ’ Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the re-re-election campaign to see whether such a move paid off at the ballot box.
“ Campaigns don not spend so much money on surveys and focus groups unless you don don ’ t think seriously about something, ” Martin said on AC360.
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential change.
While Daley declared that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change, the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that double down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political explorations have reached Obama ’ s desk.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama knew nothing about the investigations into whether drodrop bedes in the election.
“ Possible, ” Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
Has postal secrecy y technically implemented in the design of the Internet service e-mail e-mail similar similar the that of traditional postal services?
In the conception of early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
That is why the basic technical protocols have attention been paid to creating a solid basis for a audi-safe exchange of letters.
As a result, a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user " Anna " sends a mail to " Benni ", are the computers directly connected?
The e-mail program or browser of Anna sends the mail to your service provider's mail server in the first step.
For example, if it has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the route, mail mail can run via many other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are conventional e-mails read on their way through the net?
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the way.
In the sender's provider, is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
The providers also check whether this is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
On systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate by Gmail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google may provide links to holiday offers.
Even unknown people read the emails?
There is very low likely that unauthorised persons will read a mail.
In theory, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the possibility to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or hear e-mails.
There are also possible illegal spying operations.
Is it possible to protect emails against reading?
Encryption according to the OpenPGP standard can be effectively encrypt an email against reading.
With a great deal of technical effort it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even easy to identify who communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to an August 2013 investigation by Convios Consulting, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While the holdings of Yahoo Mail had recently fallen, Google ’ s Gmail was able to increase significantly.
Mother in the Forest Burst CollRres
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care benefits.
In order to be able to continue to collect pension and care fees, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after an investigation by the police.
First, he covered up the deaths of the 89-year-olds, then he collected the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected as long ago as May: then it became striking that the dependent mother was no longer needed medicines.
The pensionator told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to know.
It came out that the two had lived in a common home for more than 15 years and he had recently cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, obation showed no evidence of capital crime.
Feel like ice cream shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice aming in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine life to create a luminous treat.
He came up with the idea after reading a research on jellyfish and persuading Chinese scientists to produce the luminous protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumaten, increasing the pH value in the protein and triggering the luminaire.
Chris explains that the ice cream reds to the warmth in the mouth and shines – so the more you lick, the lighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder founder of the cream cream company “ ick ick Me I DelDelicious ” ” says, “ The product is incredible, but at a very early production stage, getting two grams of it for pounds 200. ”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH increases and the ice shup.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to us to bring it on the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made, because the jellyfish luminescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlies's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, ‘ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream ’.
This is in itself impossible because of the refractions of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I suspect we will find a way to do it.
Iice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball league after six days of match.
Now, of all all, Ingo Ehlers team will see the derby against TSV Daverden tomorrow, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts again for us.
" I hope that will finally have our heads free, " spouses gives himself cautiously optimistic.
With the exception of the permanently wounded Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his complete board at his disposal.
Daverden also, like us, relrely on tempo game.
We must therefore keep our error rate low.
Above all, however, there is to increase increase the coverage, which has recently left anything from a certain impression.
Daverden ’ s coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that ’ s why we are far from being the favorite, because everything can always happen in the derby.
However, Panitz now wants to move up in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
This is why the A-Young Joost Windßuss, who is active with double playing rights at the A-Youth Bundesligue HC Bremen, is making his debut in the season.
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was small, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress guup for the neighborhood.
Today I have become more of a halloween muffler.
For the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my home, and I am not to will this year either.
But according to the statistics, I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 15158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and decorations, according to the US Retail ’ Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will amount to about EUR 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year's attractive inanimate items are the last cry.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daf-punk space men will make it into the instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed up our dogs last year and, to my surprise, were not alone.
Indeed, Americans are spending $330 million this year on pet costumes, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of “ hot dogs ”.
When it comes to sweets, we are not squitish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, sucks, candies and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the the Department Department of Commerce who are wandering through the neighborhood using the s“ sweetor sour. ”
Indeed, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and, let us not deceive ourselves, eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is sugar-sweet candy corn, yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of confectionery Manufacturers.
That is about nine billion grains of maize.
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than the houses where it spits.
They have great names like ‘ Terror Behind the Walls ’ (which, by dentally dentally, is in a real prison), ‘ Howl-O-Scream ’ and ‘ The House of Shock ’.
Indeed, there are 1,200 officially recognized spug houses in the United States that generate $500 million in revenue, America Haunts said, including the wonderful photos just peeing into your pusers and then putting friends on Facebook, where you don ’ t get rid of them again, and then leave you with the guy you stand with a comment like “ nice facial expression. ”
But let us finally move to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Big Pumpkin when we were children, and carving a pumpkin lamp like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from a very young age.
Fortunately, thanks to Pinterest, the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend only began last year, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin, not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lamp, which slowly rotts in the front garden, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score right points, call Tintin and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something nice from their 921 kilos pumpkin.
Housing Fire in Helmbrerecht: Rescue have charred Corpse
The fire brigade had to leave in Helmbrechts late on Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof starts fire during the night for Friday.
The rescue services have a charred body from the house.
Rescue services found a charred body in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrechts.
It is not yet clear whether it is a resident, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
In the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already striking out of a window.
The room was very small and the bathroom was very small.
This and one room were burned down completely.
The entire ground floor has been damaged.
According to the police spokesman, all other residents were not at home during the fire.
The building is no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany ’ s largest state church has an offensive form to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible lack of parish: The Evangelic-LuLutheran State Church of Hanover the the number of currently around 1,800 pastors to halve by 2030, according to the current situation.
Today ’ s s profession is very attractive to young people and offers good prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and the daily routine yourself.
For the first time, the state church commissioned a pastor with castles on a full capacity to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people are deciding to study theology after graduating from high school ate.
Burfien attricrithis to the process of secularisation: " God's voice is quiet, the world is loud ".
In the same, the profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my calendar and I can focus where it is important to me.
Pastors, as pastors, could be very close to humans.
They earned as much as teachers and could make a good living from it.
To be sure, the free economy pays more, but theologians would have a safe employer.
This meets the needs of today ’ s young people, who are concerned not only with carecareer, but also with meaningful work.
According to the state church, which covers three-quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring every year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a degree of theology start their vicec’ al works.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien aims to organise study days for young people and also to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The theology study offers a broad education.
You can even become President of the German Federal Republic.
Land Rover Rally Series announced

They are not all experienced cyers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as an reachable path to world-class events.
We are pleased to open up this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the strain and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge features a training and testing day in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire Fire Briggade to save a ch stuck 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous rocky outoutcrop in a quarry
Cockerspanbitch Ruby had run away after a minor road accident.
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in its predicament.
Fire fighters sithemselves on the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death.
The fire brigade succeeded in bringing to safety bitch stuck on a 15-metre high outcrop in a rock wall.
The nine-month old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after Sunday road on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20 to whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service fire fighters.
They had desperately looked for their missing bitch and published calls for help on social networks when she escaped after the small road accident in the quarry.
Around 14: 15 on Wednesday, a walker carrying out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 metre high heel in the quarry.
Cleckheaton Fire Station's technical rescue team rushed to the spot and sied off to save Rubby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue specialist, said, “ She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock face – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was frozen as a stiff.
But now it is doing well.
She then eaten a few dog cakes.
That has been quite an unusual effort.
The fact that the dog has been discovered is believable.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said, “ Ruby had a huge luck. ”
There was a possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “ Watch the rescue rescue was ghtening. ”
I could not believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back in their arms.
The veterinarian said that if exhaustion had become too great and collapsed, it would probably have collapsed.
The firemen have done a great job.
What they did was really courageous.
We are simply so thankful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added, “ We were afraid she would fall, but she stayed at the top. ”
The fifighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger said that he never hiited Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she had worked on Jagger ’ s 2004 song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” as a background singer.
Perry explained that she had had dinner with the aldricker and that “ he insended me when I was 18. ”
She added, ‘ It ’ been a long time ago and he was very nice to me. ”
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70, said that he “ categorically denies that he had ever made approaches to Katy Perry. ”
The representative added, “ she may have confused him with someone else. ”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance during this year ’ s Rolling Stones Tour.
Their new album „ Prism “ immediately reached number one this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives ScScots choice ice
A new day, a new horhoran about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the Hadrian Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal pointed to the possible economic benefits that greater freedom to travel in the rest of Europe, but this was ir, as expected, in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend to their strict rules when it are better to them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in exchange for what the Scots really want.
So not really not a story.
And one that has come in many years that it already resembles a fossil: for the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for Brussels Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unify Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project has officially died.
Across the EU, parties gaining ground that are anti-to to the EU or want to abandon the euro as a single currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Alternative Party for Germany – founded only this year – was able to win almost five million votes in the September federal election, effectively driving the Free Democrats (equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been popular opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
But the current economic crisis is proving to be a turning point.
Many people believe that the European project has gone too far because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket into which the national economies is forced by adhering to the single currency.
The euro ’ s crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members at exchange rates that are advantageous to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to leave.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the ‘ green ’ energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice much for electricity and four times for gas than the United States.
This is a crippling cost drawback, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage wage pricing in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being marginalised by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is emerging, especially in France, the EU ’ s former cheerleader.
After the war, France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle for keeping Germany at bay and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no Paris needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, is what the battered French economy is struggling with.
As a result, Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive post-election, egegthe ruling Socialists in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that right-wing division will automatically benefit the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly found popularity among white working-class French?
It wants to use next year's EU elections to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is perfectly possible – then the first time, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I would like to make: in the not-too-distant future, the growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the “ Europe of (sovereign) nations ” that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may be stuck to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the United States.
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do and where.
I suspect Scotland could do very well in a looser European network if we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking is is easier a a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same with Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably, the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe, and won a spectacular majority in 2011, owing to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts for Labour Labour Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem-coalition had to responsible.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now only only to impose austerity by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing up Quicker
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach adberence rather than their white peers, as research shows.
Physical Change does not Immean mean Puberence
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The Trend toward Early Puberty is Less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter is already growing breasts and shame at the age of seven or eight?
At this week ’ s annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference in Orlando, Florida, the pediediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and a new norm.
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is not a sign that adberty is now occurring quickly, ” explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious indications of development, such as growing breasts, shamatic and armpits hair, and body smell, can be seen earlier in girls.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (the occurrence of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“ When breasts begins to develop, it will take at least two to three years for the Menarche, ” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “ Early Puberty in Girls: The essential guide for dealing with this common problem ”.
Time is the most accurate test of how adolty progresses.
What, indeed, is the beginning of adolence is controversial, but “ prepremature ” is true when breast enlargement is accompanied by a surge in growth an age of eight years ago.
In most cases, the process slows or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
If faster is made, tests by an dicronologist may be displayed to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and avert another consequence: premature bone aging, which can ultimately imhibit growth and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, the speed of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medicines, but he admits that “ suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings, unlike being their peers. ”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
“ They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side, ” said Kaplowitz.
“ It was a shock, ” recalls a woman whose daughter got her days at the age of ten.
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many extensively published theories about the causes of premature puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones are caused in milk or other foodstuffs, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls, used to enter adolescence.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls between the ages of six and nine, which establishes a link between body fat and adolescence.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In that country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberence rather than their white peers.
There are various explanations for this.
Globally, early adberence seems to be influenced by all kinds of things, from economic conditions to the climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have been growing facial and shamams earlier, the trend towards a full earlier puberty is not as strong as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and hair is common even among babies and toddlers.
“ We must be careful how to identify the true beginning of puberty, ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“ This can mean you have to make a conversation earlier than expected, ” advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who flourish early need insurance, which the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than expected.
Jumbo Manufacturers Strirel over seat width in the face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading manufacturers of aircraft over the width of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter collision at this month ’ s Dubai Airshow.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines are making most efforts to achieve, but this designated space is the key to efficiency claims in the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co aircraft.
Airbus called this week for an industry standard requiring a seat width at least 46 cm (18 ches) in the tourist class, but the US arch-rival Boeing says that this is something for the airlines to decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft and are expecting record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the back of the aircraft is – especially whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic results given that the new “ mini jumbo ” design is supposed to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized “ 777X ” seats 406 people in tourist class seats that are more than 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inch wide tourist seats, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share blows about technical details means through advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus is calling directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take place with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could mark the start of a new ad war, showing donors a picture of three people squeezed together in a restaurant with the title, “ Would you accept that? ”
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats narrower than regional turbo ups, ” says Airbus Sales Chief John Leahy.
As eating habits change, people get thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970 ’ s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-range prices, and the end of the century, the average male American ’ s weight increased by 10% between 40 and 49, according to US Department of Health data.
According to US health statistics, the average male waist in the twenty-first century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that its rival is following a 1950s seat concept concept, when the body range of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrower.
Research were carried out, according to Airbus, that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increased sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing denies Airbus ’ figures on seat dimensions and says that it is not up to the manufacturers to decide how airlines strike the balance between air fares and facilities.
The company also states that, according to research, the experience on the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
‘ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe they need in order to be successful, ’ explains the air cabin expert Kent Craver from Boeing.
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
It is about more freedom of elbows for passengers, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that can affect turnover.
Behind the dispute lies a race for aircraft orders estimated estimated be at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a major impact on the US or European export record.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 per cent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing ’ s statements about the results depend in part on the 777X, with its ten seats per row, is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per series.
“ Boeing is therefore squeezes more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products, ” says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for tighter arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper fares.
“ Eighteen inch width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the ’ offer is driven by the 777 77 threat, ” says Mary Kirby, cabin equipment expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world ’ s jet sellers even carry band with them to measure the equipment in the face of the competition.
Even if they praise comfort, all manufacturers also offer highly condensed aircraft for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a ten-seater A350, but it says that it not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of greater cabin adaptability and offering wide aaisseats for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that calls for a new industry standard is likely to evaporate, but it may distract attention from the wave of 777X sales.
A New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could wipe out the pleasure of Smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
More tests are needed before human tests, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good.
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, trying all the methods available on the market, but have seen their nicotine addiction stronger than these approaches, ” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information used to produce nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then produce a permanent stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt and neutralize the nicotine molecules in the blood before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice to whom nicotine was given maintained their normal level of activity.
Mce without vaccination, by contrast, would have taken a “ out, ” researchers explained, a sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, because it turns liver cells into antivillage factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if absolutely certain, could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“ They know that when they start smoking again, they don ’ t feel fun because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to get rid of their habit, ” he explains.
British scientists have said that the results were interesting but, at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies to having been influenced by Obeid
The former laboratory party minister Joe Tripodi of New South Wales is being investigated by the State Corruption regulAuthority.
The former NSW minister denies to having changed the maritime lease rules at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned hidden holdings in three land on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC – Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigations on Friday into whether Obeid has influenced various state ministers to renew lease contracts at the Circular Quay, where the both ds operated two restaurants and a cafe, without invitation to tender after their expiry in August 2005.
It is now being investigated on the charge that Tripodi knew of both ’ s hidden interest in land, after Tripodi ’ s former Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole testified accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pressed for public tenders for lease ases.
The tenants were opposed to this and also wanted longer running times.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay companies, which earned the two $2.5 million annually, were renewed without public tendering.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Port from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally in favour of public tenders.
But he denied having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pressed for a transformation of the government ’ s lease arrangements.
A telephone record submitted to the ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi, and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Ministry after working in the Fisheries Authority under Obeid.
“ Was the issue raised in these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease? ” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“ No, ” replied Tripodi.
I cannot remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes attattacking destinations in Syria, to official sources
Israeli fighter aircraft attacked a destination in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, according a senior official to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the objective was, but said that it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on role supplies to Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ authenticity Test ”
As part of enhanced measures, the government is considering an “ authenticity test ” for 47 visa foreign workers.
If the test were to be introduced, it would be used by means of a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as the back door for the entry of family and friends into Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after former laboratory Party Ms Maxine McKew, condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers, which might be considered insended by Australia ’ s neighbors.
“ Loud explanations like “ foreigners should stand the back, ” and “ hire Australians first, ” a very very unbackbackde at a time when unions are calling for a protected labour market, ” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this has said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region were parim an echo of this historic artifact, it would not surprise me.
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures once envisaged by former immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who visited Sri Lanka yesterday to talk about trafficking in human beings, has implemented five of the recommended amendments, and the others are still being considered.
If the ‘ criterion of authenticity ’ is adopted, someone applying for a visa could be checked to see whether ‘ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to or personally linked to the holder or relevant person of the supporting company ’.
Firms could also be obliged to account for the number of 47 visa holders, after in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers hiemployed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died from a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week with a refugee boat.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with Australia to Australia been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since the death of his father on Wednesday.
The Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes that high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England should be established as early as Phase 1 begins in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project ‘ will bring Britain closer together ’.
The Scottish Minister for Transport, Keith Brown, said that he is very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
Once phase 2 is completed, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is talking to Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and improved time time for the north of England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a journey time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: ‘ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together ’.
We are moving forward with HS2 because it has enormous advantages.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But there is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented, “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland. ”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to “ unequiunequivocal ” to promote Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said, “ The high-speed rail link has the potential for enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but at the same time Scotland s economic power also provides an case for fast rail connections across the UK. ”
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner to the British Government to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that will benefit everyone and that complements the Glasgoow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the facof inquiry with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Australian passengers continue to need to shut down tablets and smartphones on take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to ease regulations governing such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their guidelines so that passengers can read e-books, watch, or play videos on their equipment during critical flight phases they are in “ flight mode. ”
Passengers are already allowed to do so during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books at take-off and landing.
Australian airlines are monitoring the decision that US airlines require huge amounts of work to implement, but have no immediate plans to change their rules.
The Air TraffControl Authority (CASA) also stated that it would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment continue to apply during critical flight phases in Australia.
“ CASA currently has no specific regulations on the use of electronic equipment in aircraft, ” was announced.
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held discussions with CASA to extend the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and has said that they are open to change, but that these must be initiated by the legislature.
“ We would like to see review of CASA ’ s approval of electronic devices, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience now that we offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight, ” one spokesman said.
Qantas said that we would stick to the current rules for the time being.
“ Our current guidelines stipulate electronic equipment may not be used at taktake-off and landing, and we have no plans plans change change, ” explained the company.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and we will certainly look carefully at the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
The decision varies on US companies varies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference by mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and customer instruction.
“ Having confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height, ” the FAA announced.
In rare cases, when the visibility poor poor, the crew will instruct passengers to switch off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats on take-off and landing.
Before the vinederby against Schalke, travelling BVB trailers with lamuminons had created ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
VfB Stuttgart have signed a contract with contract with a silence - at first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic that offered available to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guest fans with their songs were heard.
The Southern Grandstand, by contrast, where the most loyal of the loyal - and lou- BVB fans stand, at initially presented exceptionally quiet: no songs, no battles.
The pedestal of the capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint taxer, remained unoccupied.
And at the front of the gallery there was was a flag flag with the words' Prohibition of stadium'.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller was the first BVB player to enter the square as as always did chejoy burup for a short term.
When his team colleagues followed, there were loud vocals and floaving scarves - but no means everywhere.
Nothing was moving in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern Grandstand.
The fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel enumerthe positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of coach Jürgen Klopp's contract - did not create a fesmood.
It was only five minutes before the k--off that the capo climbed his poestal - and the tension hitherto almost tangible with hand unleashed in a loud cry, as Ds, as usual asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
Finally, as always, it was the turn of the South Grandstand - and finally, as usual, it was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call for " Derer-winner is up up came from the the southern gallery, everything was as usual.
The silence before that was probably a response to the events of recent days.
Immediately before the roundderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB trawho had travelled had fired lamaires into the auditorium and the square - meeting almost gogokekeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was late started because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the leaders of the Ultras in Dortmund in his office - and they believe to Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement, " announced the BVB boss at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the ultras from choreographing the home match against VfB Stuttgart.
'I have banned that, " he explained.
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras have been shown various ways of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the Federal vocational B will establish a sanction by the end of next week.
" That will becoming decisive, " asserted Treaschers.
We look forward to see what the reactions in the southern gallery will be.
Deposit houses in Singapore oming booming as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a custdeposit house in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga changes a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay their daughters ’ school fees.
“ My husband and I have just bought a house, there ’ s all my money is it, ” says Amirthalinga.
Although she ear$ 3,000 in Singapore (about €1,730) each month as an administrative assistant and her husband works, the monthly family income is insufficient, she explains.
Indeed, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it exchanged, became the third deposidge listed on the Singapore stock exchange this week.
Lodging jewellery is not not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as favorcheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhouses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17% just above the 15.4% required by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch office in the same shopping mall.
However, deposit houses offer the advantage that there is no need for a verification of creditworthiness or proof of income, which is why loans are possible more quickly than with banks.
That is why millions of people in the region turn to deposit houses as families feel the pressure of rising cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit from loose fiscal policies in the developed economies, lower-and middle-income families are looking to deposit houses to make up the difference when the economy falfalters.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, called a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
The Agency estimates that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list, with 80% of GDP, a 60% increase recently in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about Thailand ’ s high of consumer debt, which this week has barely barely emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decrease in consumer demand.
“ The end result, this means that, as costs rise, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible, ” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have exacerbated the trend to pledge personal items, as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn the family ’ s jewellery into cash.
In Singapore, about 70% of the pledged items are gold in the deposit dge ages the the city gold.
People say to themselves, “ The price of gold looks good, let us pledge grandmother ’ s gold chain and bring it back next month. ”
The largest Thai deposit gage operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% increase in customers in its branches in recent months.
Deposit growth growth so strong strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branches and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company four four houses – also outside Asia Asia according says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60% of the $66 million Singapore it collected this week with the Singapore IPO.
While some lenders have been crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that deposit houses not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
“ Customers borrow items that they already own, and the liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase household debt, ” she explains.
The deposit bond business is increasingly accepted by society as short-term, secured financing.
Nor are they all people who use a loan in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax branches to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, receiving up to 60% of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all walks of life come to us.
“ These include the wealthy who borrow for a business or investment in the short run, or small businesses that have to overcome cash flow bottlenecks, ” says Yeah.
Sometimes they simply need money very quickly.
NSA suextracts data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to Help
Edward Snowden, the secret service Revller, has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to light on the increasingly explosive NSA late events.
According to Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green Group, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence official would testify to a German public prosecutor ’ s office or a committee of inquiry.
Snowden pointed out his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to ARD magazine " Panorama ".
Australian ’ s $325 million Tasman Bailout
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions attached with the Australian $325 million bailout of Tasmans health care to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging island population, a higher rate of chronic diseases, and systemic restrictions.
The four-year funding was decided following government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“ The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe, addresses the unique challenges facing the state, ” Plibersek said today.
The $35-million package consists for $31 million in emergency electoral assistance.
A further 26600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures gray star treatments, are intended to eliminate residues.
There is also money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after in-patient stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic recording system of health data in local hospitals.
“ These investments are in line with the ideas that hospital staff affected have told me are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system, ” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability to the Tasmanan Government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional money was spent.
A three-member commission is being set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie declared today, the $325 million would be of little use if “ it were not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmans health-care system on a more sustainable course. ”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, he first made to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“ I am confident that federal aid will go a major contribution to removing the state's public health system from the list of concerns, ” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these gains will largely compensate for recent cuts.
But the federal health policy spokesman, Peter Dutton, believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ paster solution. ”
“ We are in our situation today because the laboratory government has withdrawn $430 million from the health care system, ” he told ABC TV.
It is not acceptable for a state government to take nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and put EUR 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretend that this is good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar in the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with its exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier food than necessary.
The plot that played in France in the 1760s tells the moving story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent to her monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of one extremely sadistic upper chief and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips off into glogrness or sensationality – and therein lies its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tormented shirt for the public.
According to one monitoring Group, Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons
Syria had destroyed important chemical weapons and lattice gas munition manufacturing facilities, declared the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group on Thursday, while serious clashes took place in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war almost three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came the day before the date on
November 1, set by the organization Damascus, based in The Hague, to destroy or make “ inoperational ” all facilities used to manufacture chemical weapons, including all machinery for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all chemical weapons chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, cus, cus, has yet to begin to destroy existing weapons and supplies.
It country suspected there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals weapons weapons the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting were taking place in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts say that there is a chemical weapons and storage production facility, as the UKbased Syrian Human Rights Observatory atory announced.
The activist group, which persecfollowing the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, declared on Thursday that 120.296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 were part of President Bashar Assad ’ s army, 18,678 being pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
This figure has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced around two million people to flee the country.
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have links with al-Qaeda groups.
The Centre said that there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fighting underscores the threat to chemical-weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its isonison arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, “ the team is now convinced that it has seen and experienced their destruction of all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria. ”
That is why ‘ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment ’.
Earlier this week, the inspectors declared that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of the 23 of the sites designated by Damascus.
According to the inspectors, it was not possible to visit two facilities because of safety concerns.
On Thursday, OPWC declared that, according to Syrian statement, “ the two sites had been abandoned … and that the objects in the chemical weapons programme present there had been relocated to other facilities that had been inspected. ”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will have to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“ I salute the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation, ” said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Supervisory Organisation in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad ’ s government and its security forces, which which many members of AlaAlawites, a secession of Shia Islam.
Looking to further developments, the observation group ’ s leader, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there had been a major explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Anger at Judgement for Bali Bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angry at the verdict to the last of the instigators to be brought to justice for believbelieved that Umar Patek should be shot by law.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of South-East Asia's most wanted people, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
Suspension, he could be dismissed after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
There has also also guilty on in a number of terror-related charges, including a wave of explosives on Christmas Eve on churches in Indonesia in 2000.
The public prosecutor ’ s office had called for a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man also known as the ‘ Demolition man ’ for his reputation as a masterful bombing builder.
The decision arousoked painful memories among June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 31-year-old twin dauters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his fellow conspirators almost ten decade ago.
Fighting tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“ You should present him with a shooting command, ” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when, on 12 October 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small truck ked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded an explosives filled backpack.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and “ died ” three times while attached on a life-support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved same same fate the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas, and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
It is is that this type should be given the death penalty before anyone else.
Leaving him alive – no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to go on trial.
He escaped almost a decade of arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden barely four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent tfied that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding ding between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“ He didn ’ t stand up, ” Corteen said.
Until recently, he showed no remorse for how much suffering he inflicted on other people.
The verdict was made before the tenyear anniversary of this year ’ s attack, which is perpetminated with commemoration ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“ There will be many tears this year, ” said Corteen.
Patek can still to appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic equipment on aircraft (but not make mobile phone calls)
Travengers can now listen to their electronic devices for read, working, play, listen to music and viewing films from departure to landing, but not use mobile phones, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
FAA staff Michael Huerta explained at a press conference how fast they would be implemented depends on the airline.
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated flight training manuals and the equipment storage storage rules in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA said that it has already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could soon approve the enhanced use of electronic devices, ” the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You are not allowed to restart them until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When landing, passengers must turn them off again and not restart them until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic disrupbancould allow allow their passengers to use the equipment on take-off, landing and rolling field, said the FAA.
Most of the new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight creants, welcomed the changes.
“ If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline on this – both sides will benefit, ” Glading commented.
Frankly, we are tired of to feel like watchdog on this issue.
However, Internet connections for browsing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data below three kilometres remained prohibited, explained the authority.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still not a “ Words With Friends, ” the online game like crcrble that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines in public because he refused to switch off the while the aircraft was parked at the boarding gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed, because there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited.
Regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a safety on national transport on CBS News, said that mobile phones are still regarded as a risk.
“ Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disruptions with navigation devices, but also because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt transmitter es, ” says Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine this issue recommended last month that the government authorise a wider use of personal electronic equipment.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to ease restrictions on use.
Critics like Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of equipment has become ubiquitous.
Some studies say that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the equipment will be switched off.
The FAA began to restrict passengers ’ use of electronic equipment in 1966, after reports of disruptions to navigation and communications equipment by passenger led FM radios became known, which represented the latest technological trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA in such a way that they do not care about electronic interference.
AirAirlines have been offering Wi-Fi internet access when the altitude is reached for several years.
The planes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic equipment under the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today ’ s electronic devices generally emit much less radio than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit minimal radiation when you roll over.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the of loosening restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers.
In 2011, company staff invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not identify any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the equipment ruption was real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee have said that there are only a few reports from pilots in favour of disrupting aircraft systems, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended to the FAA that pilots be allowed allowed order order passengers to switched off when instrument landes in poor visibility conditions.
A group in the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a sensible adaptation for travellers who would now be fully equipped with technology.
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in odds with safety, ” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Birds rescued released by air rescue service from North Sea drilling gs
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into nature.
The watertrap was flown helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was ced by the Scottish CA) to its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “ This water rap was probably a wintry migratory from northern Europe, stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea. ”
It seems that the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling g.
He added: ‘ He could not continue flying, so we were contacted with the request for help ’.
When they was released, the water trap was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the aim of bringing the economy around the table defining what those in Britain who provide prosperity and work want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders, ask them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives who reflect roughly UK ’ s corporate sizes, sectors, and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while states in the EU are stagnating.
They want governments to favor new trade links with countries such as China, India, and Brazil, rather than boboged down the long and arduous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
When they believe that on certain statutory issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, because, according to companies, the costs of Brussels Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trading zone – even 40% of the most traditionally pro-European -European companies agreed.
Finally, and probably probably the most says, our questioning of business leaders revealed that a clear majority from Britain wanted a course towards changing the agreement and a trade-based relationship with the EU, not policy.
This insight, percingfound among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that will bring the impetus of action back to Britain.
The stis much at stake – changing the agreement and improving conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion opinion in of remaining in the EU in a referendum at 16%.
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation of a significant shift in the balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves toward closer economic and fiscal union.
Pripriority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey shows, what for companies will paying greater attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls the pipeline in Bulgaria the start of a new gas era
The start cement construction the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom board.
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone: construction on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun, ” said Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is supposed to create greater diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A treaty between GazGazm m and its Ukraine in Ukraine, where most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe, creates increased risk on conventional routes, as officially say.
Miller said that the direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated “ forever. ”
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at discounted rates when the whole project comes and running in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction in other subordinate countries is due to begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff accused of charges against Jonathan Lord of sexual crimes.
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual crimes related to children before charges ations were brought against nurcare Jonathan Lord of Caringbah 2011, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
But, when the Commission was opened statement to the Commission, YMCA declared that “ “ the organization had never involved an incident incident sexual abuse of abuse. ”
Managing Director Phillip Hare was consulted about a case case one YMCA employee had been accused with crimes involving child pornography, and another in which one YMCA Caringbah Hall sports teacher was convicted in 1991 of abusing children entrusted to him.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA ’ s opening declaration to the Commission was also imprecise in claiming that “ there had been external reviews of the YMCA in which the MCA was recognized as at the forefront of child safety. ”
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest rating of four possible results in a quality audit carried by the Department of Education and Communities in August.
Hare, who started at the YMCA with 21, admitted that the management had failed “ from me downwards ” to hired Lord, and failed to ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted at the beginning of the year of sexual crimes against twelve boys during his two years on work for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
It ly denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem preventing employees from reporting Lords ’ violations of child safety.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, carafter them privately as a babysitter, letting her sit on his lap, one saying that he liked it, and let children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Child Service leader acqui Barnat, who was the superiors of Lat YMMCA Caringbah was was very intimidating and very near for most most time. ”
The Managing Director said that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had imppromised their judgment, which is why they would not have reported him.
Hare explained that he had informed his opinion with the board of directors of the YMCA NSW that the lesson the organization should learn from the Jonathan Lord incident was “ not concern reporting ” by employees, and the Board of Directors has agreed to him.
Hhave said that the decision to urge staff to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations occurred was made by Liam Whitley, Managing Director of the YMCA ’ s children ’ s services.
He said that this was intended to prevent evidence from contamination contamination but which has was ‘ overzealous ’ and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was working there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, to the commission.
He explained that there have been ‘ serious problems ’ in recruiting, verification, familiisation, training and supervising employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said that he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admitted that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade of Head, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and has mostly limited limiting comments to foreign policy and his role as Quartet envoy of peacemakers to the Middle East.
When asked whether he would like to return to as Prime Minister, the Evening Standard of London quoted Blair as saying, “ Yes, safe, but that is unlikely to happen, so... ”
When the horse camp experts came in droves in Cardiff to cut the horse of the year, they knew that there fierce competition imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The knee, which is not even in the kindergarten and took its first steps only a few months ago, and his Shetland Pony Toffee loosely trunk through the three laps and won first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable couple, both of same size, were praised for their appearence, behaviour and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
During he performance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate hat in a cheeky angle and led the two year-old coffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony well above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his performance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a present for his third birthday and has practiced with Shetland pony every day ever then.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “ Fenton and Toffee are a great group. ”
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and left the course with gold trophy and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had taken part in a competition with coffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howell told us, “ The entire audience was electrified, and everyone fired and applauded him. ”
He ran the entire length of the arena on sand and, although he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to look after.
As it started, it will not be long before he is on the “ Horse of the Year ” show – and I ’ m sure he ’ ll doing well.
As spokesman at the annual horse show said, “ Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony. ”
Together they are a great team.
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee for how well they had bethemselves and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They take care of good cooperation between pony and guide – and there were Fentand Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am m sure Fention ’ s sweet clothing played its part in making this really perfect for the occasion.
Reforming Chinese Newspaper After CCall
A Chinese newspaper calling on the front page for the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reformed, declared a press regulator.
The Guangzhou based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a sub-state firm.
Now the New Express is being “ fully recfied, ” the regulator declared.
The “ rectification Order ” came from the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film, and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary research showed that the New Express, which belongs of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports about the publicly ded company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“ The New Express ’ s editorial management was disorderly, ” the regulator announced in a statement.
She said that she had decided decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter ’ licence. ”
Moreover, “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to complete rectify the New Express and recommended that the relevant persons responsible for the New Express be identified and that the New Express management team be reviewed immediately. ”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, reporting alleged financial irregularities in a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published the front page two calls for his release and backed his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television, admitting that he had published false reports for a fee.
“ In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence, ” he explained to the state news broadcaster CCTV.
I did so primarily because I was looking for money and fame.
It has become clear to me that I did the wrong thing.
Following Chen ’ s apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page and declared that they failed to check the reports correctly.
Various well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing someone to accusing themselves.
Discovercovering US-Mexico Drug Tunnel Tunnel
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation, and electrical railway operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the tunnel measuring 120 by 90 centimetres as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever found.
The tunnel, which runs over almost six football fields ches in the zigzag pattern, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden lorries.
The authorities said that the tunnel been closed before drugs could be transported unnoticed.
The to notes the tunnel provided the discovery discovery discovery discovery tunnel ensured eight eight and half tonnes tonnes of mariana and 8 8 kilograms of cocaine.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of owning and intended selling selling marijuana and cocaine.
They face imprissentence of between ten years and life in a convicted verdict.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive network of underground wealing channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the October marijuana harvest in central Mexico, posing the challenge to the drug cartels of how can bring their products to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640 metre long track passage that ran from a kitchen in a residence in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.

According to the encyclopaedia, veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism, but it is very from vegetarianism.
While vegetarians afford to eat cream cake, ice cream, or a strong Edam, these dishes are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to renoing meat and fish, the vegan stops consuming animal products - honey is also denied.
One might wonder what remains, but on closer examination, the vegan food world is characterised by considerable imagination.
" Bread spreads are very popular, " explains Ute Henkelmann, owner of the local reform house, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
The native New Zealand has been living living vegan for 13 years, and in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live.
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
" The conviction came not only because of its diet, but also because of the choice of shoes, " says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He recognized that other everyday issues without animal products are also possible.
First and foremost, vegan an an ethic.
" I don't want animals to have to die for me, " Proctor says the maxim of vegans, which covers all consumption patterns.
Instead of mourning burgers, stirreggs, or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products and enthusiasm increased.
" It's a double bonus, " Proctor says today, " in fact, being being vegan is not a unciation, not an asceticism, but an asset.
And it was precisely these conditions, however well-intentioned attempts, made some attempts fail.
" The addiction factor is a very important factor allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking, " Proctor makes a comparison.
And applies: " Certastes are not to be attached to the animal ".
It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
" You can also create the same effect in other ways, " explains the vegan.
Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He takes care of a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste hearty.
Of course, there want something between the teeth, that is legitimate.
" It should taste, but this should not just be reduced to animal food, " says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disdisorders which is another widespread assumption, has not suffered.
For me, there was a positive aspect to the changeover.
I do not absorb any foreign cholesterol and have an increased proportion of vitamins.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
" My blood values are excellent, I often check checked, " says Proctor.
Many vegansim critics especially warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
" Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is doubtful whether the vitamin B12 content of in the meat you buy in the chchest of refrigerhigh, " Proctor finds.
Vegans can also take the coenzyme in tablets.
" My B12 values are fine, " he explains.
Proctor for food procurement does not have to go as far far.
After all, staple foods exist everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
Everything I need is on the ground.
Only from time to time I buy something special.
" Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive, but that is well known that the true with " ordinary " finished products ".
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly believed.
" There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small tricks you can achieve good, if not partly better, results, " says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with his vegan cheese cake Proctor was also able to amaze his father-in-law.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
That is dynamdynamic. If cocotogether takes a new importance.
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves, " Proctor says.
Of course, he has already been given skeptical.
Do you not like my food anymore?
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk? " - on such questions you have to act with sensitivity as a vegan.
" I am not reject people, I am part of this society, " Proctor does not want to wait enclavendas.
And more closely, the everyday world does not seem as veganalien as ected - and the vegan does not as restricted in everyday life as is commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pes es be found everywhere!
" Many döner shops offer falafel, or even a vegetarian Yufka, " says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he switches to pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants adapt so slowly to this.
" When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, things was much more difficult, " the New Zealanders can find a development: " You have to talk to people, make aware of them'.
" If there are enough inquiries, they may be inclined to supplement the menu, " he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the compartment in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants that other restaurants to have at least one vegan meal on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
" Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others, " Proctor notes.
" If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a sure way to make the majority of it impossible in the outset, " says Proctor.
However, purchasing vegan products may be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially if one learns to understand that animal additives in peanuts can also be as a sensor of der, one seems to quickly leave leaving courage to follow the ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: " Veganissimo - Animal Indients and their Alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are added in food and cleaning.
" Gradually you develop a scanner view and know which signs and logos to pay attention attention to " It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble, " Proctor says.
Veganism is an important moral finger that beats against consciousness.
He may not quite manage able get get rid of his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits.

It then took exchange operators almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all US equity trading came to a standstill for several hours due of a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.
Last year ’ s IPO of Facebook also caused a stir.
The Nasdaq systems had not been to cope with the flood of purchase and sales orders, later identified the SEC Exchange Commission, and sentenced the company to a record $10 million.

British Police Proviel Assange an Extradition Dectice
Today, the British police submitted an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and sought asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard declared that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a “ invitation to face ” asking him to appear in a police station, and added, if he did to comply, he would be threatened arrest.
Assange threatens to extradition to Sweden for charges a sexual offence after exhauexhaupossibilities under British law since the Supreme Court refused to appeal to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had “ sent a 40-year-old man a invitation to face a police station at any time we chose, ” one spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, accused of possible charges of espionage after posting more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks revelation website.
Drivers who have been sicked with 210 km / h and a hot drink between their legs will receive £1,000 penalty.

Foreign Homouswners Tax against London ’ s Speculative Bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who imposed a 7% stamp tax on homes costing more than £2 million in the 2012 budget, well as annual fees on buyers who hold homes as a company, not individuals.
The revenues from the stamp tax tax on property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which stood at £708 million in the 209-13 fiscal year, already exceeds the s for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and the Humber region put together.
Cook said, “ After the stamp tax increases on high-price housing and the introduction of related legislation against evasion, it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is taxed too low, regardless of the impact of the outdated local tax system. ”
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant about buying property in London, or discourage owners from selling, ” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five-ten% of the interest-price housing market – in London ’ s wealthy Southwest belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has by a record 11.8% last year.
According to a study by Savills, Central London grew grew evenly 5.5.6%, but were overshadowed by an rising “ domestic market, ” with the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%), and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection of a dog ’ s swelling and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wander with the tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while for nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said, “ Man is well known that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimulus that provoke positive or negative emotions. ”
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral forests of their breren, researchers monitored the animals as they watched these films from other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of four-legged pets and analyzed the behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction and the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, “ We have shown dogs films with dogs – either a faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, allowing enabling us to control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right. ”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they stayed completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog waving), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
He is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience which movements they should worry about and when they should not.
He said, ‘ If you have different encounters with other dogs and swalking with the tail in one direction is more closely linked to friendly behaviour and the right is to produce less friendly behaviour, you react on the basis of these experiences ’.
Researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinary surons and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behaviour and guest schollow at the Faculty of Veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to examine whether it important for dogs, the left and right.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that that dogs turn heads left when they look at an aggressive dog and right when it comes to a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria in Canada said, “ Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog if his “ tail ” wwaving on the left, not right right rather than restless – exactly the other way round than in the Italian study. ”
According to him, the differences could come from the fact that in the various studies the dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details have need to be determined – and dogs are no exception, ” Brashaw said.
However, since their behaviour is easy to record, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.

Pope Francis appoints First Cardinals in February
On 22 February, Pope Francis will first first appointed new cardinals from the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and it is they who elect a Pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of men to ultimately help choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
But a cardinal at the age of 80 can no longer take part in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals. ”
In a statement publishing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that there would be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as consistency, was held.
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene consistency in February so that other meetings requiring cardinals from around the world to participate can be planned, ” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals is likely to have fallen by February.
He declared that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary to keep the number of eligible cardinals 120 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he likes.
Next year ’ s consistency is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero says.
At present, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe, and Italy in particular.
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance, ” he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, established by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
“ Now Francis has chosen the eight cardinals to help him, ” said Valero.
He said that it was ‘ perfectly possible ” for Francis to ask advice from the cardinals.
So far, however, we have not been in this situation – this is all completely new.
Valero said that bishops from large places were typically called cardinals, but Francis are “ full of surprises – so we don ’ t know who he points. ”
GM reclaims new pickup pressures in the US to repair the seat backrest.
General Motors will call back nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup Trucks built 2014 to address a problem with the manually manually adjustable seat rest, according to a announcement from the US Vehicle Safety Regulator on Friday.
In some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines on vehicle safety in head restraints.
“ When climbing the vehicle from behind, it is possible that the head restraint does not protect protect properly properly resulting in an increased risk of injury, ” read the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were produced between August 1st and September 10th.
Delivery of GM pressures began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
Due to the 16-day government shutdown, NHTSA was unable to check the letter of notification, which had a negative impact on car purchases in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the model year 2014, increased by 20% in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup prints.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Obama Obama voter ’ Cry of Despair
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republican blockade tactics.
Bloade policies do not excuse Obamacare ’ s website problems, the drone strikes
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what could have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I thought would cheer ten me up during the gloomy second year of my medical studies and give me hope.
It is called “ The Audacity to Win, ” portrays Barack Obama ’ s memoirs in the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient transcriptions in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take the breath away of a speech.
The election became a landslide victory, and news spokesmen stopped to illustrate the historic significance of the moment.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had 82% approval ratings.
And then I close the book.
Switching to the present again is a nasty awakening as if you were pultaken out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem a vague reminder, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Something has indeed changed in the years since I first voted.
But it is just not something I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act on health insurance to military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I agree that party political blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But, having defended the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end of my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why allow eavesdropping of foreign leaders or kill innocent children by overseas drones.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about American private lives, and why whistleblowers who expose government misconduct are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public limits on funding and spending are circumvented during the presidential election.
It does not justify the results of a report that states that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are ‘ ‘ most aggressive... since the Nixon Government ’.
More recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I do not know whether that is what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age age 18 18 that the work of government government might contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the Deputy office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate.
However, if I look at the examples examples, they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.
And that bothers me most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and ill-conceived alternative; he seemnot being able to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from pressure from future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard about for so long.
But, as Obama ’ s approval ratings falling to less than 45% this week, this book has made his return to 2008 all the tougher.
It arakens me the desire for the many promises that have evaporated.
This week, I read a section in the book describing how Obama made a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a meeting with the election workers following the decision, he told his staff that they must get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
“ I want us to find our magic, ” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr President, and I could not agree with you more.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and parliamentP, Clive Palmer, says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interests in his parental leave plans, because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from them.
The mining magnate, engaged in a legal dispute over paying $6 million in carbon tax, claimed that, when he wanted to brep aside questions about whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether to cut or cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott ’ s daughters would personally benefit from the law.
“ He is in a major conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets holidays, ” said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared to be the winner of Fairfax ’ s Sunshine Coast seat, by 53 votes after the recount.
Palmer called for a review of the voting counting process to speed up.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“ We need a better system, ” he said.
Why should we not have a system in which you invade, enter the data into a computer, dial immediately and then get the result at 6: 30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils in marking the ballot papers.
Do you use them because you can wipe out the results if you don't like them?
Voting with pencils today is unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and has recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and that he would take his new post “ very seriously. ”
A public office is about serving the public.
“ We seek no reward but that of history, namely that we can serve at a critical time in this community, ” he said.
RBS suspends Two Foreign ex Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange allocation, two who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government investigation into alleged manipulation of the currency market is taking ling rapidly.
Some of the world ’ s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities to investigate the world ’ s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion change ownership every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the growing investigation that the boror interbank scandal entails.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
“ Our investigations into this issue continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators, ” the Bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation indicated that the RBS had sent the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is said to have been left from his current position as European Head of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European spot trading at Citi, was left on holiday this week, and Matt Gardiner, former senior currency distributor at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been accused of any misconduct.
Usher Instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss Regulator declarof Finma that it was investigating alleged manipulation of the -exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority (Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently working on accusations that bankers have agreed on currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from the authorities, said people people familiar with the situation.
Banks comb instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has roset traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but has been under pressure this year, because low currency volatility restricts opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play play the affair and saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign-exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that, despite the enormous daily volume of foreign ex trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and banks ’ increasing use of their own internal platforms means that “ you can influence the market with very low ticket prices. ”

Painted the Building fence on the Bechtle Land
A group of the citizens' initiative " Schweizer Wiese " embellished the fence on the Bechtle Land on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
She also cleansed and widened the footpath, to a press release.
The planned cover of the disintegrating house at the back of the property had not not allowed for safety reasons, because the site is in danger of slipping.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed the emlishfication operation with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the BI' action, a banner bearing the message' We are in favour' had been placed.
This, however, did not bother the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative in their actions.
Their motto on the big poster was' We are against building ruins'.
In doing so, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the huge project one day fail.
In talking to many passers-by in front of the " construction site ", it became clear that some citizens believe that many would be better off in realising the city's project, although quite a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city is further delaying these answers, the BI say.
As we have heard, the mayor's public statements are also having an impact.
May had said at the municipal council that he feared the end end the thermal spa if the population voted against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadows when the citizens' decision.
According to the BI's press release that some seem almost frightened, others it as a " crude attempt at blackmail " against the population.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Scows for Shias: Don't get a Swallow King
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the " Bulls " was disappointed by the referees.
" There is currently a dangerous tendency to push Mane and Alan into the category of swallow kings, " he defended the two offensive wirbles at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent reason for Rangnik's criticism was yellow for Mane at last Sunday's 3-: 0 against Grödige, in which the Senegalese was fatalised by an supposed acting - but one that was not one, as the TV pictures showed.
" A glatant wrong decision, " Rangnick said, as referrefercalled Harkam " completely overstretched. "
Harkam would also have played his part part in the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Garcoach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German compatriot deciordinatically: " I would have behaved in the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation ".
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact contact his his after after the skmismiswith the hut.
I do not know why.
'I am the one who has been insulted, " the 46-year-old stressed.
In view of the success, however, Rangnick was a orus of praise.
'There are only two words for this: really good,' he said.
There is not much disectionit.
The way in which the team plays is particularly impressive.
This should surely continue.
There will be hardly any change in management during the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
" Except for a player approaches with the wish to leave the club, " Rangnick clarified.
The Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court ruled today that the health-care law closely linked to Barack Obama was constitutional.
By five to four, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which forces US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority.
Chief Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy chose ted against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 200 page law, and also took the view that the Health Act ’ s requirement that states should either extend access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise cancel all state Medicaid subsidies was not unconstitutionally restrictive.
The law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was roundvely rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the eventual challenger, Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian Site Feitself with Giant Mirrors Light
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have light on on their dark valley.
Due to the low level of the sun, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks into the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at an altitude of 45 metres, a century ’ s dream came true on Wednesday.
" Finally! " Mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at start-up ceremony on TV2.
Some of the inhabitants of the valley moved around sunloungers, others up sunglasses for safety reasons.
Until now, sun--hungry people have had to take a cable car to a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to use mirrors to the rays into the valley.
However, this basic idea has existed in the town since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally adopted the project, costing SEK 5 million (around EUR 615 000).
A similar construction has been providing the Italian Alpine resort of Viganella with winter sunshine for several years.
Post Little Empty ty Sundays

A request from the FDP has confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, empempty is place front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether there will still be tied in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP ’ s question.
The FDP ’ s spokesman for social and youth policy, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to insist on this.
SunSunday days is an important postal service, especially at appointment ments.
'Despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013, this undertaking is radically and unreasonably ably fertilising this'.
Thomas Bittner, leader of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat rat Party Party Party group and city association, supports his group colleagues:' What annoys me is the fact that empting times are being surreptitiously changed or even deleted'.
The post office is miles away from close to the citizens.
" At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays, " says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
The city also applies that especially non-mobile fellow citizens, should be able to reach reach mailbox with Sundays days walking foot.
Röhrenbeck asked the city parliament whether the City administration is planning discussions to this matter with the post office.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
To his knowledge, however, there is also an on on Sunday in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out in favour of privatisation.
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere, " Maier said.
Frankfurt ’ s Parking Fees are ected ected To rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become much more expensive.
This morning, the city ’ s magistrate will discuss a proposal by the traffic Decellor Stefan Majer (Greens).

Public transport is also become more expensive.

With the hard and placed premikes, the Gönninger found extremely difficult.
On several occasions, they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz neatly over the centre of the net and were not there at block protection.
Two high first sentence profits clearly expressed the superiority of the joy cities in all respects.
In view of this crushing and playdetermining performance, the third set was won somewhat lax and sluggish at the 3: 0 final stage (25: 13, 25: 14, 25: 22).

In the B-class the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a fiercely contested two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and scscscores, especially when accepting the ball; precision was also, too was sometimes scarsupply; and in some critical scenes, the zealprevented prevented sight of possible point gains.
In this performingly very balanced encounter, however, Marcus Blasutto ’ s TSV team was consistently consistent with the great physical dedication and pleasant commitment of both teams.

Egypt Sworn in First First Free Elected Presiidents
Muamed Morsi is sworn in office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of Egypt ’ s political disputes.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt ” when he was sworn in as the country ’ s first freely elected president, succing Hosni Mubarak, who had been ousted 16 months earlier.
When his inaugurated before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth leader since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took his oath in front of the 18 judges sed in black robes of the court, which is based on the Nile and is embembon an ancient Egyptian temple.
“ We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic, ” Morsi said at the solemn ceremony that was broadcast live on state television.
“ Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy, and stability, ” said 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been been sharply targeted as a forbidden organization by their government since its creation 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 o'clock local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in the court to celebrate the new president, and, unlike the presidential splendour of the Mubarera, traffic was stopped halstopped so that the car convoy could cross the usually busy road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
As the Brotherhood ’ s uncharismatic “ substitute wheel ” mocked, its personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Frionday speech, presenting himself not only as an Islamist candidate, but for all those who wanted to achieve the 2011 uprising ’ s aspirations against authoritarian Mubarak to its goal.
“ Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state, ” Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, explained the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he took the oath of office.
Later, Morsi travelled to Cairo University where he would give his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel playing the national anthem to whom he listened to in hadage.
The military leader of field marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the university ’ s largest auditorium with chants of “ The army and the people are one hand. ”
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, University of Cairo Cairo developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi made a symbolic oath in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led last year to the end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule, and vowed to reclaim the presidential powers seiover by the MilitCouncil had had from the outsted leader.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not, as usual, before Parliament, he is bowing to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi ’ s Tahir Square speech was full of dramatic populist gestures.

During the trial, Kana admitted that he had been in a bar with Booysen on Tatnight.
He also admitted that he had beaten and raped her, but denied that he was responsible for the death of the girl.

You thought travel agencies are a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the entire year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual pre-tax profit of between $325 and 340 million, compared to $305 to 315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are met, this will mean growth of 12-17% compared to the record gain of $290.4 million in the 2011-12 period.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre made eight per cent of profits in the first half of the year and made a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in Australian and British private business.
“ Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some are well on their way to record year revenues before interest and taxes, ” he declared.
These include Australia and Great Britain, which are typically among our strongest results.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, offfor a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Things went similarly well for Flight Centre ’ s leisure business in the UK, while business customers spend less.
US business recovered compared to the weaker first half of the year due to season, so profit is expected for the third consecutive year for the full year.

Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling, and grammar.
In courses on English literature, must treat at least a piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes “ unseen texts ” to encourage broader reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to take an independent GCSE language exam, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education will publish the new English and mathematics curricula – the first subjects to have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Supervisory ator, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less course work.
In a speech this summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that “ there is a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence, ” stressing that the GCSEs will “ become more challenging, ambitious, and stricter. ”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours per year, or three hours per week per school year – than most other countries.
By contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement in the timetable to allow more time for mathematics, coalition circles say that comprehensive math testing – combined with greater emphasis on rankings – is likely to encourage schools to spend more hours.
The curriculum places more attention on “ problems from the real life, ” including financial mathematics.

On the way through mud, rivers, and jungles for Free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in West Africa, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to elect him CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his exceptional work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father lost consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain, causing a haematoma there that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, ” says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“ It ’ s not easy, ” comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to hospital to be the first, yet you are not the first.
There are a great many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell ’ s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
In the United States, on other hand, the ratio is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for her, most Cameroons would not be able to afford to visit.
Two in the country ’ s five people live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country ’ s health-care spending is private.
“ The only problem they have is poverty, ” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To saw his father and so many of his compatriots suffer matured in Bwelle to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas at weekends and provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people forced themselves into minibuses and use their fitted medical equipment on the roof to travel across unaved terrain to the villages in need of help.
Not everything always runs smoothly.
On more than one occasion they have had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are received like heroes: a feast, singing and dance, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care really is a cause to celebrate, and a wave – with its broad smile and boundless energy – happy to attend the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team starts examexamine hundreds of patients.
“ We treat 500 people per journey, ” says Bwelle.
You come come a a kilometre radius of the village on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document needed for school but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anaesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or an flat; after the operation, patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the surgical and the disinfection equipment is powered by the group of the group, so wave and its volunteers work until the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It is a strenuous effort, but village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“ They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work, ” says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team will returns to the city, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free operations last year, and knows that its work makes a huge difference to the people it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a rupture he had received now allows him to work again.
“ That is changing the future of my family, ” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, Bwelle says, he finances 60% of his non-itable activity; the rest comes from private donations.
“ I really don ’ t know when he ’ s sleeping, ” says Katie O ’ Malley, who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and volunteers in Bwell ’ s group.
He is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organisation so that he can go to these campaigns.
This is an opportunity for medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
" We can be present in operations where we help drain blood or consider the instruments to be Dr. Bwelle, " explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their own trip to Cameroon and often bring donated sanitary material.
Once in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes care of the accommodation, transport and guidance.
" He is undoubtedly a hero, " says O'Malley.
He deates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no bounds.
The almost permanent work is not a burden for Bwelle.
He gives him great pleasure to help others live happily, thereby fulfilling a promise he made to his father.
“ I ’ m so happy to do this work, ” says Bwelle.
And I am thinking of my father.
I hope he can see what I am doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Mastered FighExcellent
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel " The Old Man and the Sea ", is cut his body by Horst Janson.
Janson is himself an old rabbit in his profession, the acting.
No ody can deceive the old man Santiago Santiago while fishing.
So the two simply complement each other magnificently.
It is almost thought we can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man referred to by the fishing boy Manolo.
If Santiago sits tired of life bending on the chair, that is real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is a through character role role JanJanson plays excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man, who does not give up and who ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his will.
Janson is largely on stage as a single actor.
He managed to focus the audience ’ s attention, himself that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is made up of only blue bottles of water.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man work in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance he he to on the active scene: the hut of Santiago, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gfavorst, who with her songs and her splendid voice sils Cuba ’ s feeling of life.
The four musicians play Cuba ’ s rhythm and are guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
A Roman sewage channel has been preserved beneath Cologne at a length of about 120 metres.
If you visit Cologne, you can't miss the cathedral.
The two towers rise around 157 metres into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
Few visitors who admire the two delicate church towers suspect that there is also a lot to discover beneath the Duomo.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Köln-Tourism directly at the Dom.
The tour starts quite unspectacularly: " We start in the underground garage, " says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the fathers of the city wanted a city that is suitable for a cars, so, of the remains of the old city wall, only that was not too big remained.
Most users of the multi-storey car park now hurush past the remains of remains and park only their cars.
However, if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal latds in the D2 parking deck.
You can see about five metres high ruins made of hand-hand-sized stones.
" These are remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century A.D., " Schulze says.
Before it comes back to light, Schulze the participants on the upper level of the park park a look into a dark, 15 metre deep shaft.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which unfortunately it is hardly noticed.
The nearest stop to the tour is the preetorium, where the participants descend again.
We are here the headquarters of the once the most powerful man north of the Alps, the preect of CCAA.
A visitor wants wants to know what CCAA means.
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ", which means " the city of Roman law and the city of the Agrippines, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the imperial cult ".
And the prefecture is the former governor palace, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
A access to to tunnel tunnel leads from the anteroom to the sewage wage channel, which is preserved here at a length of about 120 metres.
" You can walk a walk along so so-called Cloaca Maxima if you like, " Schulze encourages its guests.
There is has another surprise.
After getting the key at the box out, he leads the group to a 16-metre deep walwalkable pit.
" We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath, " he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to obtain the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different levels of water can be read through changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall square, for which construction work is due to start shortly.
However, it will be a few years before it is completed.
Dore Almost chacked off: Reedition of the Rocker Process
After more than four years, a bloody attack in the rocker environment is reopened.
A trial of attempted manicighter, dangerous injury and damage to property against two 30 year of ds has begun before the Frankfurt District Court (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants remain silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and were one of the bandidos at the time.
The Public Prosecutor ’ Office accuses them of having cking and and ating ating three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group of Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a senior member from Berlin.
It seems that this been preceded by a chase with several cars.
According to the accusment, it was about land battles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been acquat the beginning of 2012.
A court speaker said at the time that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice overturned the judgment after the revision of the public prosecutor's office and referred it back to the District Court for retrial.
One of the defendants is currently openly execution for another offence.
At the beginning, the main focus was to rebuild the processes during Tatnight.
The Commissioner who investigated at the time was invited as a witness.
The focus was on mobile phone conversations between the defendants and other people had avcepted by the police.
What is difficult is that rockers almost always abide by a law that legislation to them in court - not testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor's s Office Frankfurt (Oder) said on request that new traces had appeared since the last trial.
Eleven more days of negotiation are scheduled for the process.
The Disable Society Don Not ThThink
The night was long, the music was loud and the atmosphere was good, but at some point it goes home.
The only thing is that hunger is being felt in the bellies of the people on the front-passenger and back seats.
Of course, this may be the fault of some cocktails or sparkling wine!
What could be more obvious than driving chilled to the next driin in treat treat yourself a little bit?
I admit that I will be happy to be there when it comes to fastfast food late night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then none like from home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco merchaners become be apparent.
What can you miss is fact fact that the regular throwing your fast-food bags out of the car window?!
Especially at weekends, discarded paper bags are located at the edges of the streets in parking lots.
'Why?' I wonder.
Are people too doof to take the bags home or the next rubbbin?
It is not just the case that the paper creg spoils the landscape.
Bags have already concealed transport facilities such as control barriers, have thus caused accidents.
But that is not what what that' disposable society' thinks about, she probably does not even know what that word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back bench can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other rubbish fill up up.
A few bags would not more or less make any difference - unlike the road, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I can already see the day coming when the towns and communities will be clearid - and the fast-food chains will have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Obama ’ s Heth-care Hitrack
Yesterday, after strong criticism, President Obama backtracked on his oft-repeated, clear promise, “ If you like your health insurance, you can keep it. ”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurer received a letter of dismissal, the Republicans have accused the president in recent days decdecving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them, ” he said during a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports of dismissal, Obama called on the Americans who received such messages to look for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicected.
“ You are making a better offer, ” he said.
The government described it hardly surprising that the five% of the population who took out insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff, because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“ I would like to say quite directly to these Americans: they deserve better, ” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House of Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, declared that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October.
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else, ” she said.
I am determined to regain your confidence.
The statement by an angry Sebelius to an adviser behind her at yesterday ’ s House of Representatives was received after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long of Missouri over whether she she be be obliged to attend Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly besiassed with the question why the “ architect ” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance insurance to take out a rate herself at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm the attack on Syria ’ s Air Base
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous told the American news broadcaster CNN on Thursday that Israeli fighter aircraft attacked an air base in Latakia, Syria the day earlier.
According to CNN, the aim was' missiles and related equipment' which the Israeli Government feared were destined for Lebanese Hezbollah.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab station Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been fired from from Wednesday to Thursday at night, and blamed the Israelis.
The Israeli television station Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, where Russian S-125 Nwa defensive missiles as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles, covering 35 kilometres according to Channel 2 and able to transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Unsecure The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
But the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not safe.
In any case, one spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said:' We are not commenting on these reports'.
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried earlier, partly successfully, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a' red line' followed by a military response.
John Kerry, in an unprecedented admission that US espionage “ has gone induly too far. ”
John Kerry hinted with an unexpected admission of a weakening of US ’ s defensive stance on its surveillance programs by saying that espionage has “ gone induly too far ” in certain cases.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, shared with Barack Obama,, for focusing ing on “ autopilot ” as the explosive revelations of whistle blowers Edward Snowden about the NSA ’ s spying activities became public.
The leaked information, the US government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
In a videoed speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said, “ There is no doubt that the President and I and others in the government learned about some things that were done almost by an autopilot, simply because there was the ability to do what went back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to September 11. ”
He was then the first senior US member to admit that US espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, ‘ In some cases it has gone unduly too far ’.
The President is determined to clarify matters and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one must feel that abuses is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process.
However erry Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force for good, and that many lives had been saved by its surveillance operations.
He added, “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves up. ”
There is radical extremism in the world obsessed with killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what happen if we were able to intercept and stop this before it happens?
We have indeed prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have learned about such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to allay concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to working with the US in counter-terrorism efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs declared on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about their threats not to participate in anti-terrorist organisations because of frustration with National Security Agency's monitoring.
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board in our joint efforts to combat terrorism, ” said Murphy, who first first sits in the Senate as a democrat and serves as Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger through the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were incorrect and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited from documents by Snowden that the NSA had monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phones and up to 34 other world leaders.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides.
In all this commmoil, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the Congressional trip to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members are due to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route was still being worked out.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations, he also said that there would be some “ serious words. ”
He said that European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they themselves have been using for years.
“ While we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones to spy, ” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, the weekend, John Kerry will travel to the Middle East and Poland the weekend to address resentment about US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.

Australian woman appeals for Thailand onment in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced in Phuket to 15 days in prison for misclaiming to have been raprapby a taxi driver, appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June for making a misfied after telling to the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her during the morning hours on Sunday 10 June, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had entered her hotel safely after having been separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she admitted she had had amed up the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the ground.
Bamford was sentenced to 15-days in prison in a low-security prison on the fringes of Phuket, rather than in an adult prison.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubby League, who has appealed to the Foreign Department in Canberra for help with his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the entire family was “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
“ We are very concerned, of course, but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible, ” said Tunisia.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a bail of 50,000 Baht at large.
Australian reports have reported that has meanbeen on holiday in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The Court said that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that, following the recent assassination of travel clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may seek to improve its tarnished tourist image and thus a acquittal.
