Oil tanker " Stena Impero " left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas this Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set moving and left the Iranian port. The port of destination was Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released on Monday by the Iranian government, but it initially remained in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it said that they wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
The " Stena Impero " had been found on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on charges of violating security regulations. However, it was believed that Iran was reacting to the controversial, temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the British-owned Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important maritime routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil export is shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely over the past few months. Merchant shipping was drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.

Chancellor Angela Merkel has ged the commitment of the people in the GDR, who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had brought the former GDR regime to shake, Merkel Merkel said at ceremony held by the Thuringian CDCDU faction on the forthcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. Among other things, the Chancellor recalled the occupation of the German Stasi headquarters. " The State Security was relieved of terror, " she said.
Musk strives for an extradition record
Tesla's quarter may hold a record. Despite the delivery boom, there were recent losses at the electric car group.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. " We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, " wrote Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek. "
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it said in Musk's newsletter. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customers. In addition, TesTesla must provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went with a plus of over six percent from trading. So strong the price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95000 cars and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digfigure figures must be produced in the current and coming quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
Riddle solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from being able to tickle themselves. Scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin discovered this with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children defend themselves so violently against tickling, only to ask for more.
It showed, he said, why only the approach of a tickling hand causes a layer in the cerebrum ebrum, which causes laughter in the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with " laughter " in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans. This " laughter " is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-contact
Until now, it was previously assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments experiments on the rats that the laughter as well the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-touch. This is also the case when living beings clean themselves. However, during the foreign touch and the tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh had been increased.
But if the self-touch and the touch of others happen at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat could not distinguish between the self-touch and the touch of others. The new findings suggested that people cannot ticktickle themselves because the self-touch activated a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats and rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Thus, they sometimes broke this initiation early in the experiment, showed escape behavior or or rigidity. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished, as the Prefecture of Normandy told the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire broke out on the night of Thursday.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances have leaked. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in use with about 200 fire trucks.

The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU on October 31 1st without an agreement, if Brussels does not agree to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement.

Monument to the Oslo and Utöya attacks unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya, with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims is unveiled on Saturday in Oslo, Norway. The monument " Jernrosene " consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They commemorate the roses depositdown by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
The project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be revealed at the same location - the roses forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and survivors of the victims. Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit, among others, are expected to attend the opening.

Iran releases British tanker
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one problem less. The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " could in Iran sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero, " which has been detained in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
" StStena Impero " has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai, for medical examinations, said shipping director Erik Hånell. Around noon the ship has left Iranian waters. " It's nice that it's over, " he told the Swedish television channel SVT.
The Foreign Ministry in London described the loation of the ship as illegal. " This is part of a pattern of attempts to compromise the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law, " a statement said on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had detained the tanker on July 19 on charges of violating provisions of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had been released at the beginning of September. Hånell said that the remaining 16 crew members were doing well under the circumstances, and had behaved professionally in the past ten weeks in the face of the past difficult situation and the shipping company was now working to reunite them with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected behind the fixing of the " Stena Impero " a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: There the beginning of July a supertanker with oil from Iran, which is supposed to be intended for Syria, was put to the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery against EU sanctions violagainst the war country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the US.
Iran spoke of " piracy " and threatened with consequences. In mid-August the " Adrian Darya-1 " was finally released. London vehemently rejected assumptions that it might have been changed in order to free the " Stena Impero. "
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important maritime routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil export is shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely over the past few months. Merchant shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There were several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries. Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The US unilaterally emerged from the international nuclear agreement in 2018, which was to prevent the country from building an atomic bomb, while ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been pressurthe leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country, in order to enforce a toughingent agreement that has been extended to other areas.
Because the dispute over the " Stena impero " and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhanii presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative " Coalition Hope, " for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection, wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is impeding itself a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would be destined as a " war-profiteer. " Given the punitive tariffs imposing by American President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to replan. CEOs of the Asian companies, who consider moving their production from China to another, name India as one of their favored alternatives in a survey by poll. However, this is is not only due to the imponderties of the Sino-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and an internal market of 1.3 Bof consumers, India seems to have created to play a more significant role in the widespread global production chain.
But now India itself has come into Trump's focus. Disjoringly called a " kingdom of tariffs " by the bigdog in the White House, America withdrew emerging country's trade preferences for 2,000 products in early June. The US is accusing India of prohibitively high tariffs and is demanding better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, friction with India is only a sideline. Moreover, America also views the world " s largest democracy through security glasses. Delhi and Washington are linked by concern about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a volley of punitive tariffs against India seems improbable. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just begun a second five-year term, is therefore likely to be safe.
The problem, however, lies somewhere else: The empirically cordened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult position in the socialist Republic of India. Even under Modi. His zeal for reform mainly mainly targets the bureaucratic insanity, which for too long has been stiflle any entrepreneurial ial spirit in the multiethnic state. Companies now receive building permits for buildings more quickly. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructures, and a more effective insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for more rapidly liquidating seemingly dead companies with high debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has changed for the better in India in the first five years. However, this does not apply in trade policy. Driven by this to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign providers, the National Conservative government even erected new barriers.
In the West, Modi has the aura of the energetic reformer who ally ally renewed his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows too well, which vocabulary is appealing to Western managers. In essence, however, the " India First " advocate never moved away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic workences and to become fit for global competition. Business people who survive, thanks to the insulation of their industries, among the regular voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaun this short-sighted policy.

Carried by the competitors to the finish: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The top of the world had long since reached the finish when heart-warming scenes played in the cooled down Khaliifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba ba ba ba began to dangergerously. He could hardly ely stand on his feet a good 300 meters from the finish, ran in an unhealthy stooping position when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly hook him under and supported him in the last last half stadium round to the finish. However, the forces still still enough both of both of them to to the stop the running wristwatch after the the finish. As if the whole scene had not been curious enough.
" I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing, " Dabo said after the Mixed Mixed Zone race when he unexpectedly completely attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. At first, shshshsh,, did not want to talk about all about his heroism. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best and when he realized that this was going to be difficult he only wanted to help a fellow-suffererer. In any case, he would only be proud to represent his country, having been invited to the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he would not have been allowed to start. " That's why I'm proud to run here for my country, " he said.
He did that emphatically on the evening - and much more intensively than he would have thought it. Because this feat will remain in the memory. Especially since Dabo even left his competitor Busby the lead at the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end it had no nothing in the end, because the Busby, who only finished with a lot of help, was exactly therefore in being disqualified by the World Athletics Federation.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had started to set a personal personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this succeeded with 18: 10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: " I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. I was been under 18 minutes. " However, only in training, as best times don't count.
Millions mash: Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been intensified in the run-up to possible protests critical of the government. An increased police presence was observed in the center of Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed and streets around central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, the police had already strengthened their street checks and the mobile phones of pedestrians had been partially searched for news and photos connection with the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo occurred in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura against the government of President Abu Fattah al-Sisisi, whom critics have accused of corruption corruption corruption and mismanagement. There had not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt. Indeed, the Egyptian contractor and actor, Mohammed Ali, who lives in exile ile in Spain and started demonstrations with video messages on Facebook called for a " million march " in central places in the country this Friday. Ali calls for a " people's revolution. " Although for most young Egyptians, the man is not a " good, because he cheed as a subcontractor for the army millions, but his messages are coming through.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to increase according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests as of Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human-rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Initially, these figures could not be confirmed. The government also failed to confirm or comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were " arrested arbitrarily, " " just because they were in the wrong place' at the wrong time, " said HRW, citing to the arrested's lawyers. According to their lawyers, the charges against those arrested range from " dissemination of false information " to membership in a " terrorist affiliation. " In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, who, according to HRW, fureover, interviewed and arbitrarily investigated passers-by.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. According to this, the Cairo government is blocking websites and online services in order to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: mail-order retailers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns thus end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailts like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products rather than destroy them.
Although you could not exempt companies from VAT on donations in kind, the ministry explained on a question of the Green parliamentary group, on which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, dealers could set the market value of the unsellable returns so low that they had to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists from the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens return every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - then ended up up in the rubbish. According to current legislation, donation would would cost companies additional money, because the tax authorities assessed donations in kind such as a turnover that then incurs VAT.
Green Group leader, KatKatKatrrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies can evaluate products-for-sale accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. Companies Companies must be able to rely on not to be punished for donating. " This applies not only to online trade, but also to other shops, from fashion shops to DIY stores.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of street art star Banksy, " Devolved Parliament, " will soon be auctioned off.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines " the transformation of the oldest world the's parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude shaped by animals and tribes. " The painting is to be on display at Sotheby's in the British capital from Saturday until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum, in the Southwest, where Banksy resides. This year the artist had the painting exhibited it - to coincide with the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion the work, which was formerly called " Question Time, " was renamed the " Devolved Parliament. "
The picture could change hands for a million.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had fought a hard fight with the opposition at the first session of the House of Commons following the cancellation of a Johnson-imposed imposed break imposed by the Supreme Court. Johnson intends to carry out the twice-postponed Brexit on October 31, if necessary even without an agreement with the EU.
This is not the first time Banksy, whose real identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east England, he painted a picture of a man chiseled and smashing a star of the European flag, with thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the UK every day.
Brexit debate is like a " walk in the park "
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fierce verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top advisor. Compared to the election campaign ahead to the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a " walk in the park, " said Dominic Cummings at a book launch on Friday. " We enjoy that. We will withdraw (from the EU) and we will win. "
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit-opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them of " betrayal " of the people, other things. Accusations that he could put the MPs in danger because they could be the target of death threats, he dismissed as a " humbug. "
Cummings said that the only way to calm calm is for MEPs to finally respect the UK's recent decision to leave the EU. It comes as no surprise that people are been upset about the fact that Britain hasn not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood even the bishops of the Anglican Church called on Friday for restraint. " We should talk to each other with respect, " a statement said. " And we should listen. "
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
In his first appearance before the United Nations General Assembly, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise a renewed war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, said Khan on Friday at the UN general debate in New York. " If that goes wrong, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst. " The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. " You should have prevented that. "
Since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India withdrew from the Indian Kashmir region autonomautonomous status and thus suddenly increased tensions in relation with Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is reacting harshly to the current protests in Egypt. By firing live ammunition at the population, more than 2,000 detainees are joining the 60,000 political prisoners who are already held in in prisons. Protesting has never yet before been harmless in Egypt. But since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything possible to avoid a scenario like in the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the reasons for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. " Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of their being suffocated by their own government, drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that the el-Sisi regime does not get a grip with either, no matter how hard it takes against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is at per percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket you have to decide who to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression but also the biggest economic player. The military builds the ways, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was the case before el-Sisi. The Egyptian people have a lot of experience with authoritarized regimes, the dilemma in the supermarket is also old. It always becomes critical when large parts of the population have difficulties to afford a bottle of water.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER boss: No more " show stoppers " for capital airport
For two months, the test assesschecked whether the complex system mesh works in conjunction with BER fire protection. Operators are satisfied with the process. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv inspections in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October of next year. This is certain, said Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Rainer Bretschneider, after a meeting of the control Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there were still shortcomings in the terminal to work through. " We have many detail topics, but we do not have a real showstopper. " He assured that the timetable to the commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The completion notification is now now to be submitted to the building authority in the course of the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of deficiencies power cables have yet to be resolved; the Tüv wants to examine them by February. " In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, we must continue to work intensively on the deficiencies, " said a written message.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all dowels on which the cable lines hang. The airport manager expects these to be available by the end of the year.
Furthermore, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is not yet satisfactory. The problems had led to the project three years ago in another crisis. This time it is about smoke aprons, which shut down in a fire like a screen, so that the smoke does not spread out. They go too far down. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there will be new attempts with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects along with planning errors have been seriously delaying the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was scheduled to start operational in 2011. Costs have risen from two billion euros since construction began in 2006 to an estimated €6.5 billion for the opening next year.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. This is to be done at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. CFO Heike Fölster changes to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Head of HR Manfred Bobke-von Camen retires next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finance on firm feet.

In future three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Flights from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Deutschland.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman explained. Flight times are to be coordinated to connecting flights. The goal on the one hand is to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other, to expand the decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline Online writes Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a " production company " for the Group sister AUA. Thus, and others, Barcelona and, would be served with an AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings equipment. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants originate from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights taking off under the AUA flight number are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but like the AUA in Terminal 3.
A price war broke-out at Vienna Airport after the Niki's bust. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that it would increase its fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. Therefore, the Irish low-cost airline sent four Ryanair aircraft, with crews, to Vienna, also in the so-called " wetlease, " which the union criticized as a bypass construction of the collective agreement.
The challenge challenge made by Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary that Lauda would have overtaken the AUA in five years was answered by AUA CEO Andreas Otto on Friday: " We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years. "

Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, an unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
By analysing the genetic material of 9,000 people, scientists from Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to identify the causes of cardiovascular diseases in a much more detailed way.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, announced the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. The Switzerland-based Mountain Clinic Davos, which belongs to the Kühne Foundation, and the Zurich University Hospital.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the main influable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors also determine the risk. However, it was said that the interplay between genes and external influences is insufficiently known. Now, the scientists want to compare the complete genome of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients of the University Cardiovascular Centre at the UKE.
According to the hospital, over 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are currently known of disease-causing mutations in the DNA - so-called mutations -. Around 200 more are added every year.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac insufficiency and heart attacks. The data could also be used in the research of common diseases diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University's Heart and Vascular Centre. It is possible to gain new insights into the interplay between heart and brain, heart and kidney and cancer.
The chairman of Kühhne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a firm will to use the data for research into other diseases. So far, the Foundation's clinic in Davos has mainly dealt with allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovasascular Precision Medicine will be established on the medical campus and a professorship for bioinformatics will justify his commitment the logistics logistics entrepreneur, who lives in Switzerland, said that he had underwent open-heart surgery in Hamburg three years ago and he was very grateful.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from hamburHamburg who also also participate in the Hamburg City Health Study. With 45,000 subjects, according to the hospital the health study is the largest local health study in the world. The scientists assured that genetic decryption attention is strictly paid to the protection of the anonymised data. It is about one petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the genetic material of a person can be decoded today within 24 hours. The pure material costs for this would be 1,300 euros, and the first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, still cost several hundred million euros ros.The study is scheduled to begin on 1 October, and all 9000 samples should be analysed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian police liberate hundreds of mistreated boys
In Nigeria, police rescued more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to information from local residents, security forces searched the school in the North Nigerian city Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of them minors, according to police spokesman Yakubu Sabo. " The two victims were abused. Some of them claimed that they had been raped by their teachers, " SabSabo.
The boys were detained on the pretext of being taught and " correcded " in the Koran. In fact, the charges had been held by their teachers under " the most degrading and inhuman conditions, " said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children at the age of nine, had been chained in a small room.
The Koran school was said to have existed for about ten years. Residents had drawn attention of the authorities to repeated irregularities in the institution. Sabo said the parents had been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school. They had not had any idea about the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to information provided by the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people fled across the border in the course of ten months to the neighbouring Niger.
Chained and Tortured: Nigerian Police Rescue 400 Children from School
Police have rescued nearly 400 students from appalling circumstances in a school in northern Nigeria. " Many of them were chained and some have had visible injuries pointing to torture, " police spokesman Yakubu Sabo Sabo said in Kaduna.
The children had been discovered on Thursday, after a hint in an Islamic school, saying that the conditions there were " inhumane. " The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held as slaves at slaves and put in chains. Some of them were sexually abused. TV pictures showed emaciated and injured pupils in a clearly bad state of of health.
World football selection: Further accusations after Messis and Klopp's freestyle
Football " Signature not valid "
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Federation FIFA honours the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth award and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world soccer player election, accusations were coming to FIFA from other countries. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
Much things at FIFA have proven to be questionutable in recent years: the awards of the World Cup, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA FIFA FIFA FIFA FIFA FIFA election has not been been suspected of being dirty so far - apart from the fact that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote according to sympathy rather than to objective assessment.
But, after Nicaragua's captain complained that he did not vote at all, further inconsistencies now emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not show up in the official and publicly available voting table.
FIFA therefore apologizes that " the signatures on the election forms were submitted in capital letters and were therefore not valid. " The association had contacted the Egyptian association several times in order to clarify the situation - without a response.
Sudan's coach also puzzled
There is also an outcry from Sudan on the subject of the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi on place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa however, the vote went in the same way, with signatures and the official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also made allegations: " Did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All the information on my vote is wrong, thank you, " he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted in his name.
The association now made the message on Friday: It is true,, but of course was no intention. The completed election documents documents been provided " erroneously " with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, according to a statement from the association. However, the second captain, Manuel Rosas, had voted. " We take responsibility for the administrative error, " said the statement. However, both Rosas and team coach Henry Henry Henry Duarte voted for the Messai, " as stated in the official list of FIFA. "
The other cases are now examined by FIFA in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was externally supervised by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Until then, Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans call for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly called ated an official investigation into US President and fellow-san Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, " said Vermont Republican Governor, Phil Scott. " Where that leads from here will be determined by the facts that are established. " He wants to know more about the whist-leblower affair before any action is taken, and an impeachment trial can lead to the president's removal.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been observing Biden " for years. "
The Republicans have so far refrained from criticising Trump over the whistle blower affair, few have expressed unease about it. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia already has repeatedly turned against Trump's policies, such as the easing of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Another senior Republican, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, also ed for the investigation. " It's a situation deeply disturbing, " said Baker. " The right course of action and responsibility for Congress is to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it. "
Scott and Baker, as the governors of US states, have no formal say in the proceedings against Trump, which are being decided in Congress. Therefore, their remarks are therefore symbolically very important. Nevertheless, the first Republican senators have been critical of the situation too. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the Second Chamber, said the case was " extremely disturbing, profoundly disturbing. " The US media also report that first cracks are opening up internally among the Republicans.
The affair could result in an impeachment case against Trump, and Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into it, accusing him of using power for foreign influence for his own political gain.
There is no precise timetable for impeachment proceedings. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could seek an impeachment. But the decision on an actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the chances of a success are low. So far, no US president has been dismissed by an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board Rackete's " Sea Watch "?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they are said to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she illegal sailing to the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship " Sea Watch 3 " and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and criticism - including that from Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was revoked after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious allegations are being made against Rackete. Thus, three men, accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps have arrived in Italy with the " Sea-Watch 3. " The suspects were caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily), after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. " We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any reliable information on it ourselves, " said Sea Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebauer the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.
In mid-September, the police reported that the suspects had raped, been tortured and even murdered in the North African country. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). " The migrants were systematically harassed and they were subjected to atrocities through repeated and constant physical violence, " the statement said at the time.
NGOs and aid organisations are now pointed out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. " We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports or all, " Neugebauer said. Torture is among the main reasons why people are fleeing from Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators are also on the ships. " It is therefore very important that this is followed up. "
Italy's right-wing former interior minister, Matteo Salvini, immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding in illegal immigration.
Musk strives for delivery record at Tesla
Tesla boss Elon Musk has given his electric car corporation a strong boost on the stock market, with the prospect of new record numbers.
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 shipments " Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek. "
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it said in Musk's newsletter letter. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the clientele. Therefore, Teslla must provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went with a plus of over six percent from trading. So strong the price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered over 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Therefore, six-figure figure figures are needed in the current and coming quarter. Especially, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
US budget controversy: Once again, only one bridge financing
The new fiscal year in the U.S. will begin on October 1, without decent budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional funding until November 21.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending plans ahead of the new fiscal of fiscal year beginning on October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and passed a continuing resolution (CR) until November 21. Without such a resolution, there would have been a shutdown on Monday at midnight hours, a division of the federal administration administration. Trump has yet to enforce the resolution.
Shutdown
For the time being, the federal administration is now being financed at the level and priorities of the spending plans for the 2019 financial year that ending on Monday. This is because Congress could not agree in time on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot for unable cannot benefit from the extended spending framework for the new financial year from $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion.
The Democrats have completed ten of the 12 laws in the House, where they have the majority, but the spending law reflects the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the 12 spending plans more or less ready, barhardly reach a majority.
The spirits differ primarily on the topic of resource alallocation for the area of inland security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the Wall, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats are disturbed the Wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
Ghosts Divide on the Construction of the Wall
At present is unclear how the parties want to get closer on this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November. Also, a shutdown cannot be ruled out.
Against the background of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve expenditure laws in time and the associated danger of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Subate p. 1877 for the avoidance of shutdowns, the financing of the federal administration would continue at the previous year's level, prevent the travel activities of parliamentarians and hold back their wages until the new annual expenditure plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination is also to be open to single women and lesbians in the future: The Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill under which all women to take advantage of in vitro fertilisation, which is likely to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donation.
The proposal still requires the approval of the senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp warned that numerous " children without father " could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an " opportunity " for society. It represents the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her conception, the costs of artificial insemination for all women should be covered by social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm from a dead husband is further prohibited
By contrast, the National Assembly narrowly rejected an amendment to give widows access to the semen of their dead husband for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is " post-mortem. " In Germany, there were past cases where women complained in vvain ain for releof the semen of a deceased person. Opponents of the attack in Paris argued that such a begotten child then had a " particularly difficult fate. "
Numerous MPs of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on the move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had ated artificial insemination with the semen of the late partner. They stressed that a " double mourning " would be imposed on a widow, if her husband's death would left her desire to have children unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow should in future be able to be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only permitted for heterosexual couples who are not able to have children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would still be banned.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation payment for the climate: Calls for flight tax for universities are getting louder
There is a lot of flying at universities here. That is why the country wants a a climate levy there in future. The rectors say they have no money for it. However, now they are also coming under internal pressure.
Universities, too, should restrict themselves to flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion was postponed before the summer break about a climate levy on flights from universities and colleges is again gaining momentum. After the State Rectors' Conference reacted sceptictically to a corresponding initiative from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, however, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a University of Education plead for compensation for business flights. This is " urgently necessary " as a first step, at the same time, there must be a broad ranging debate on the avoidability of flights, in their statement. Meanwhile, the cabinet decision originally planned in July July is still on hold, because the CDU still has still not approved the presentation by the Greens.
Russia once again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, however, the fishers fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had been arrested, when there was an exchange of fire between the border security guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman who later died of serious injuries. This this time there were no casualties.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic chronic shortages of food. The North Korean fishermen were traveling in Russian territorial waters where, according to Russia, the Coast Guard patrols to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 cuttlefish seized
During the renewed controls, 30,000 squid were discovered on the boats and seized. Furthermore, according to the information, three fishing and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nakhoodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's fisheries agency had not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands ands of North Korean fishermen were temporarily arrested there this year, according to the media.
The head Marthe nov, Georgi of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primor, also recently complained about high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen who fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These nets used used to even small organisms from the sea. Moreover, the nets would be simply disposned in the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose.
Only 18,000 left in future: USA lowers asylum ceiling
The " most generous nation in history ": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officers in the White House.
The richest country in the world is closing itself off from those seeking protection: As the Foreign Department confirmed in Washington, the upper limit for the legal immigration of refugees will be further lowered. In future, in particular, threatened believers and Iraqis will be granted asylum.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees. In the marketing year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, at most 18,000 people should be allowed into the country, as the US State Department explained. In the almost past marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump's administration has dramatically reduced the receptivity of people seeking protection from all over the world in recent years. Far higher reception limits had been in place under the previous government of Barack Obama.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was introduced in 1980, but the State Department called the US " the most pitiful and generous nation in history, " a phrase that strongly recalls the resparlance of the current US president.
A " responsible handling " of refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump explained. He receives much encouragement from supporters for his hard course in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of dispute is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to close. Trump had imposed a State of Emergency in order to finance the construction of a border wall. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selensky affair and possibly impending impeachment proceedings.
According to the Foreign Office, the US government wants to focus in future on the admission of two groups of refugees: people who are being persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus been in danger, as per the statement of the State Department. By contrast, a maximum maximum of 1500 refugees to be accepted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The US wants to ensure that people from this " northern triangle " of Central America especially apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has first concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration on the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An female Oranutan has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a sanctuary center for great apes in the USA at the request of the Argentine justice. Born in the Rostock zoo (the was) in 1986, Sandra was granted the rights of a " non-human, " so her release was mandatory. The animal was taken on a direct flight to the Dallas airport on Thursday evening - not not a passenger, but in the hold, as the lawyer Andrés Gil Dominguez explained.
Since the 53 kilogram heavy Menschenäffffin not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, she is live in the future in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great-Apes in Florida. There, 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees are housed, among them " Bubbles, " formerly the pet of pop star Michael Jackson. However, before entering Florida Florida, " Sandra " still has to undergo a 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, " Sandra " spent several years in the former Ruhr zoo in Gelsenkirchen before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process over " Sandras " fundamental rights, initiated by animal rights activists in 2014, contributed to the transformation of the Buenos Aires zoo into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and educational facility should be established there for the preservation of biodiversity.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussar ride on the almost 3000-meter-high Großer Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double ground or other auxiliaries, the Swiss conquered the 550-metre-high North Face of the Great Pacle in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, t-shirt and only supported by an absolute freedom from vertiginess, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent, thus beating the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder in free solo speed on four of the six most important European north faces.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The US sportsgoods manufacturer Nike has posted a significant increase in profits, despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit in the past quarter rose to 1.4 billion dollars (just under 1.3 billion euros) .This is 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. The reason for this is above all the new marketing strategy " Nike Direct, " with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
Sales rose to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period up to the end of August. Nike sales sales rose sharpgest with an increase of 22 percent in China. Thus, the Group from Beaverton in the US state of Oregon also benefited in the People's Republic from its approach to appeal directly to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue to drive the " digital transformation " of the sporting goods manufacturer with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage.Investors reacted happily to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer rose by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban for racism in Italy
Because of racist comments on football pro Juan Jesus from AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong ban on the stadium against a fan. Defender Jesus, who native Brazil Brazil had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Thereupon Jesus published the private news and asked his club to take action. " @ officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. # NoToRacism. " Proud of being who I am, " wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing with AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded late on Thursday. He had reported the fan's account on Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma supporters were never allowed to visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players from rival teams. " We cannot have racism either in society or in sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums, " said FIFA President Gianni Infantino over the weekend. The reason for the statement were racist chants in the first-division match between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florenz last Sunday.
But there had also been recent recently about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now imposed stadium bans on 38 rampaging fans of record champion Juventus Turin. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police reported. Thus, the rest are subject to bans of four to seven years.
The fans are connected with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of the ultra-fan groups in the vicinity of Juventus. The twelve are accused among other things of extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had the the investigation started with a complaint launched last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders are said to be behind the illegal trade in tickets. They had " militarily controlled " the ticket trade for the fan curve and supposedly blackmailed Juventus employees in order to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - entire vintages are given with catchy designations. If you take a closer look, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the attitude to life of young people?
" The crabs are coming! " With this call, crab-fishing officially started at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun on September 21st, heralding the opening event of the 19th Gaochun China Gucheng Lake Crab Festival as announced by the Public Relations Department of Nanjing-Gaochun County Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothill of Nanjing in Jiangsu province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international " slow city " in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international " slow city " movement. In terms of ecological ology, the city has ideal prerequisites with a mixture of " 30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields. " The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions they need to become rich.
The people of Gaochun have already with with crab farming at the beginning of the 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry, which provided high incomes and became an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In the past years, Gaochhun has actively engaged for a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as a technology-based crab farming. And the city has worked with the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and on the incomes of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform on the " distribution of power, the optimization of administration and government services, " and with carefully established the service network for " permits under one umbrella, a law enforcement team, a network for services, a platform for lending, " so the city wants to comprehensively optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun fully exploits all the local advantages by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, exploiting the development zone and of its position as an international " slow city " as a flagship to to locate intelligent high-end production facilities, for biomedical and medical technology companies, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sector, as well as organic organic farms, which are leaders in the " 3 + 2 " sector.

Conflict between Iran and US: Ruhani talks of end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged offer by the US to lift sanctions. The United States had offered the promise of an end to all sanctions in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted his Iranian counterpart via Twitter: " Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no. "
Ruhani describes the events as follows: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insiged for a meeting to take place. " And America says I will lift the sanctions, " added Ruhani. The type of punitive measures that were to be stopped was been under discussion. " And they said clearly that we will lift all sanctions. "
However, this move was not made in an acceptable way, criticised Ruhani. Given the punitive measures in force and " the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure, " no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York, on the background of the Europeans of Europeans to save the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia with Iran, which is supposed to prevent the Islamic Republic from the development of a nuclear weapon. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the previous earthquake, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. Thus, the fear of a disaster a growing.
According to Oktay, the 14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had Thursday shaken the marmara region off Istanbul and triggered panic in the million million metropolis. Now, the government wants to establish a commission commission in order to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. The latent danger is repeatedly ignored in the city itself. Every year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - among other things, made ordown by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces that have the registered as shelges in the center have long since been added. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August, the Chamber of Civil Engineers had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of Thursday's earthquake was in the Sea of Marmara in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometers, as the civil protection agency Afad announced. A smaller aftershock, a few minutes later, caused even greater panic on the streets.
The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamogğlu announced on Twitter that initially injuries or damage had not been reported. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of homes in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in Silivri district for security reasons. Some students cried, as could be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly earthquake-one. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called Northern Anatolian Disorder, which marks the border between the two Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly hit by earthquakes. However, one of the deadliest earthquakes was the quake near Istanbul in 1999 when more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, it is not clear when the earthquake will occur. In the earthquake on Thursday, it again hit the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design contingency plans, private individuals have so-called go-bags packed with everything necessary standing next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave, when the earth shakes. When the next big quake comes is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people were injured and some buildings had suffered minor damage. The Mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, followed developments at the Istanbul Disaster Co-ordination Centre (Akom), which reports ted the collapse of two minarets of mosques in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Aftershock in Istanbul
On social networks, many users report of panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Phone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than on Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from the buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the earthquake is officially given as 13: 59 (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to the CNN Turkey, there was an aftershock that with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
On Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt as far as Istanbul. Its epicentre was also located in the Sea of Marmara west of the metropolis, the civil protection agency Afad already announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake scientist Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a advance warning. It has thus become more likely, he told CNN Türk. " This could be the signs of a major earthquake, " said Ersoy to the station. " Sooner or later, the quearthquake will come. "
A few weeks weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake also caused great worries Istanbul Istanbul In addition, there had been a violent earthquake in Albania only a few days ago - 68 people were injured. The earth had also shook on Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: A new detonator in the Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. The US Democrats are encouraged on the way to a possible impeachment procedure: The complaint lodged by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president would provide important clues for an investigation against the president. Once again, Trump sees himself as the victim of a " witch hunt. " Moreover, he doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: Passenger of United Airlines locked in toilet - plane diverted
Because a passenger was locked up in the board toilet, a flight had been diverted by United Airlines. According to US media, the airline reported that the toilet door had been blocked during Flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco.
At an unscheduled stop on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin. She was imprisoned there for about an hour, wrote US media, with reference to other passengers. Passengers had to change the plane to continue their flight towards San Francisco.
In a video spread on the Internet, which according to the US media comes from flight 1554, you can see how several people try to free the woman there. " We work at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?? " says a man. The airline has apologized to all the passengers. First of all, it was open, whether the woman will receive compensation.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story " The Metamorphosis, " the successful British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel " The Cockroach " will be published in German on 27 November, announced Diogenes Verlag (in Zurich). In this, it is about the transformation of a man named Jim Sam (Jim Sams) who was ignored or hated in his former life, but who is is suddenly the most powerful man in Great Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action, and he is wildly determined not to allow anybody to stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: " When parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers lie shamelessly as the Soviet leaders once did, when the Brexiteers in high positions almost implore the catastrophe of no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to that: write. " McEwan's novel, My Machines, " about artificial intelligence was appeared only this spring.
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is that of Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself " transformed into a monidous vermin " " is gradually excluded from from family and society, and finally perishes. " Ian McEwan bows to Kafka Kafka to describe a world that stands upside down, " says Diogenes Verlag.

Prince Harry destroys mine in Angola
Prince Harry has been continuing the commitment of Lady Diana for a long time. In Africa he is now following in the footsteps of his mother.
Dressed in a blue splinter vest, the British Prince Harry has detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he produced the ignition circuit on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance the explosive device exploded in the savanna landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relicts of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to follow in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. He wanted to walk the path she walked with the same sive master who once accompanied his mother. The pictures on which Princess Diana walked in 1997 through a cleared minefield had traveled around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which has begun in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Haltering Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
Prime Minister, Boris Johnson Johnson, had clearly agreed that there would not be a third time in the postponement of Brexit negotiations, but what statements have already been in duration in the case aripolBritish British... Recent judgment of the the British Supreme Court hovered like a sword of Damocles over the head of blond. Johnson's suspension of his suspension of Parliament to stubbornly pursue his Brexit course until the date date was also annulled earlier of this week, and a law by Parliament obliges him to effect an extension of the bilateral talks in the event of failed negotiations with the EU until October 31. Johnson Johnson had categorically ruled this out.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass by Johnson noticeably either. Meanwhile, he made hints, when visiting a hospital, that in the event of a disagreement, he supported an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we will abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And preferably with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is running running away for Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have about six weeks to prevent the UK's exit from the European Union without agreement. However, the recent talks have also not achieved a further breakthrough. An agreement until the end of October seems rather difficult to concvision at the moment. If the United Kingdom Prime Minister does not break the law, a renewed postponement of the withdrawal date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the British Prime Minister's words. It fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US agency: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the USA has risen to twelve. Furthermore, there are now also 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, the US Health authority (CDC). According to a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there were already more than 900 people affected, about 500 of whom were confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unclear. So far, no similar increase in lung damage has been reported in Europe. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the USA.
Fear of New Protests in Egypt is Growing

Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in recent days, the police had strengthened their street checks and the mobile phones of pedestrians were partly searched for news and photos in connection with the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo Cairo, in Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRHRW, almost 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them were arrested arbitrarily - just because they were at " the wrong time in the wrong place, " said HRW's detainees, citing lawyers.

" Ocean Change ": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival in the port of Hamburg, he was welcomed, among others, by the skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg had brought the racing yacht " Malizia " across the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has recently investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship " Dagmar Aaen " on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement was a blessing, said the polar researcher. He had waited for years for the young generation to speak up. It had been known for decades that the earth was warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
" What happens at sea often takes place outside the public eye, " said Fuchs. Fuchs and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the litter of the oceans. The expedition among the expedition measured Greenlanland glacial ice by drone and fished for microplastics with nets, microplastics.
For his " fight for sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans " the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded with the " Seadevcon Maritime Award " as part of the Hamburg Climate Week. " For all of us, who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model, " said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. " He is witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades. "
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. Indeed, the bill with 80 euros 80 a tip was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which caused heated reactions.
" Such cases hardamage the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to investigate the question of whether this is a fraud, " demanded a spokesman for the Federagit, the association of guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The reaction of the restaurant owners came promptly. The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this cannot be taken from the bill. Even a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, said the innkeeper.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump may actually be faced with an impeachment after the tumultuous revelations of recent days, the Democrats will now want to examine this as soon as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives - the talk of weeks until a decision would be made.
The onset of the scandal supallegedly is the telephone conversation with the Ukrainian President Volodyymyr Zelensky.The accaccusation of the whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation to the public out of concern for national security and for US democracy with his complaint, is monstrous: the president aberted the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country to exinfluence on the election election. He said geexextorthe ited of Ukraine Ukraine. Ukraine Ukraine dependence in the process and thus wanted to force it to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be understood in the transcript of the conversation with Zelensky that has now been published, although it does not reflect the full text. However, the telephone call on 25 July is only one episode of a much larger story, at the center, which alongside Trump, is his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story, according to the public, begins in May 2019, when the New York Times reports reporting about Ruydy ani's's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kyiv with newly-elected president Selensensky, and the lawyer himself knows well, that his intentions are tricky. " We do not interfere in a choice, we will interfere in an investigation, what we are entitled to do, " he tells the newspaper. One could think that it is inappropriate, but " there is " nothing illegal is illegal. " Giuliani Giuliani wants an investigation to be pursued in Ukraine Ukraine for which there is hardly any basis - " because because this information will be very, very, helpful to my client and could prove to be helpful to my government. "
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have become infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had colluded with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for the Russia investigation in the US. However, this accusation could never be taken seriously.
This is precisely the very investigation that Trump will discuss so prominently on the telephone with Zelensky in July. Giuliani's the president's version reads: the former vice-president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential didJoe, Joe Biden, as Ukraine representative for Ukraine of the Obama administration urged the the release of the then-Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Schokin in namely to stop the investigation of the gas company on whose supervisory board was his son Hunter Biden Biden den den den den den den senior blackmailed Ukraine to cover up the criminal activities of his family's corrupt activities.
In fact, the procedure was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General had to go, the gas company's investigation was already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin was also accused of deeply corrupt behavior, the US government was far from being the only Western partner pressing for his dismissal. Incidentally, the Obama administration even expressly supported the investigation against the company.

Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were in a dinghy and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - it took less than an hour for the Chilean ResHelhelicopter to rescue them.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
" At 9: 30 we received the message, just before ten we started, and about 20 minutes later we were over the dinghy. "
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers were safely safely returned to their research station.
Attention: NEVER charge smartphone wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come on the market that support wireless charging and sell very very well - above all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Although wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat generation. If a mobile phone is charged charged by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. With charging, however, the researchers have measured always than 30 degrees even with perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging pad. In case the phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the power power of the charging pad also increases, which in turn increases the power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Here, every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only only loses its capacity, but also does not hold it so for as long time. Thus, the lifespan is shorter. Therefore, the researchers recommend that you always charge the smartphone via a cable. Since a battery replacement in modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful hint. Apple has recently increased the cost of a battery replacement even again - for all iPhones.

The technology is extremely convenient here: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these have now even been installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without the hassle clutter of cables and laborious plug umumbling. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) is a global standard, in which even Apple participates as an exception, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest traffic jam photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber claims to have climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, said his expedition operator.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project " Mission Possible. " He has already made international headlines: He has taken a viral photo in the spring of mountaineers standing on the Mount Everest queue.
The image of the mass rush triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848-meter-high mountain and highest summit on earth. In May, eleven climbers died on the ascent within a few days.
The climb of the 14th eight-thousander could be a problem for Purja: Currently, Chinese authorities block the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. One reason for this is bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to enable him to ascend.
Four Dead Elephants Discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. " We suspect that the elephants have been poisoned. "
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous rock fortress of Sigya, which had been visited by many tourists.According to the police spokesman, the animals were presumably between 15 and 25 years old. an autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously kept themselves. At the same time around 50 people are killed by elephants every year, usually when the animals pass through villages built near their habitat.
In Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants are estimated to remain. Their killing is theoretically subject to the death penalty.

" Apparently, we have a bad example of managerial greed. "
Experts overestimate genes at risk of colorectal cancer
The role of the genes in increased familial risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated. This is what researchers from the German Center for Cancer Cancer Research (DKFZ) Heidelberg have concluded in a recent study. Other risk factors such as familial eating habits are likely to weigh more than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of individual colorectal cancer risk, stress the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk increases Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an e-mail published to Tesla employees on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog " Electrek. " The demand was strong, so that Tesla la book 110' 000 orders, it was on in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the customers. To do this, Tesla has to use as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went with a plus of over six percent from the trade. So strong the price has not been up for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered over 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This will require six-digfigure figures in the current and coming quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been been losses.
Does British government want to bypass Brexit law? Johnson reluctantly
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is contentious about whether he is looking for ways to circumypass the law against an unregulated Brexit recently passed by parliament. In response to a corresponding question, he only told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement has been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a " capitrender law, " which makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major expressed on Thursday the assumption that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law. Johnson could employ a procedural triloy that would postpone the entry into force of the law until after it left the EU.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident to leave the EU on October 31 and the best way is to reach an agreement. "
Iran apparently increases uranium enrichment
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has increased the pressure on European treaty parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. " Unfortunately, the European states are showing inability or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions, " said Rouhani at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they did not keep their promises, he proout " further steps " away from the agreements of the painstakingly negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return included the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018 in order to force Iran with " maximum pressure " to change course in the Middle East policy that is considered to be aggressive. President Donald Trump's administration wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now reto harsh sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently responded responded by re@-@ ing ing the limited urenrichment of uranium in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used or at least prepared for use of uranium in the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not willing to bear their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of burdensome US sanctions, Rohani suspected. But there would still be further talks, which would hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the situation changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and Great Britain followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-supported Houthi rebels in Yemen had pledged their responsibility to the attack, which the US, however, be a false confession. " We have nothing to do with it, " Rohani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
" Those who make such allegations must provide evidence of this, " said Rouhani. However, the European leaders could not do so in the talks with him during the UN general debate. In Instead, they had only argued that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met in recent days with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the US administration's far-reaching sanctions must first be lifted, demanded Rohani. He called on the administration in Washington to switch to a policy of " dialogue and reason. "
Comet of other star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This was possible before, the comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a presumpecture has now been confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named 2I / Borisov after its discoverer and aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The well-travelled comet had been discovered on 30 August by the amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov at the Margo Observatory in the Crimea - with a self-built telescope with a diameter of 65 centimetres. Follow-up observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not come from our solar system.
After 1I /' Oumuamua from 2017, 2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object that was sighted during a flight of our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to gain insights into a foreign solar system from close before it disappears never and again. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Canary Islands Astrophysical Institute. " The velocity of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at this distance well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the Sun, " reported Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency agency NASA in a press release.
According to the analyses, the comet is traveling on a so-called hyperbolic orbit, which leads it out of our system - and is clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which had initially been listed under the catalog number C / 2019 Q4, received from it the designation 2I / Borisov, whereby the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar stellar object discovered in our Solar System.
The astronomers are lucky: in contrast to 1I /' Oumuamua 2I / Boryzov ov was already spotted during the approach, leaving the researchers many months for study. " The object will reach its greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020, " explained Farnocchia. " Thereafter, until October 2020, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes. "
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. In a first study, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I /' Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Images taken at the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Canary Institute of Astrophysics (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star that provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. " The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that they must be similar similar in composition, " reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes to ours ours, added de León's colleague, Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems, according to the IAU the IAU. However, it is difficult to estimate how frequent such such visits are. However, the European space agency Esa could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission of the next interstellar visitors.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part spacecet " Comet Interceptor " at a waiting position at 1.5 million kilometres from Earth. According to Esa science director Günther Hasinger, it will either lie in wait for a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor such as 1I /' Oumuamua.
First landing at Beijing's new Daxing mega airport
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People's Republic of China: a first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines has landed at the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special privilege for captain and crew.
By 2022, the new airport is expected to handle around 45 million passengers a year, and is is expected to reach 72 million by 2025. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion project. China's latest prestige project is also called " starfish " because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will be expanded to seven later, and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new metro-new subway transports passengers to the center of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
During the construction, the Chinese had already stated several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. However, the opening of the capital airport - and much smaller airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, has been postponed so far. In contrast, a first passenger plane landed in Beijing after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: from London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British Space Agency Space Agency UK dreams of that. This for supersonpersonic flight flight flight in 2030s is to to made possible by a special propulsion (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) developed by the company ReReaction Engines from Oxfordshire quoted the US broadcaster CNN CNN. " This is the technology that could definitely do this, " the agency chief Graham Turnock told the station. " We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced. "
To contribute to the project, the British space agency intends to work more closely with the Australian one. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. From 1976 until 2003, the only supersonic ic ic passenger liner, the Concorde was the only supersonic ic aircraft to the New York York Paris route and took three to three and a half hours. In 2000, a Concorcorde took off at Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport, killing all of the 109 of its occupants. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer, the LockheLockheed Martin Plans that it was planning, together with the US space agency Nasa, to develop a supersonic aircraft known as the X-Plane.
" Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport, " writes Reaction Engines, among others on its homepage. The Sabre propulsion could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere, thus enabling the " next generation of truly reusable framing works. "
Turmoil in Washington: Trump wants to track anonymous tipsters in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about the US president's possible abuse of power, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
" I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information, " Trump said on Thursday in front of employees of the US legation to the United Nations in New York. The person concerned is almost " a spy " and such were dealt with " a little differently " in the past than they are today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate the tipster. Actually, the event was not made public. However, several US media outlets distributed audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats were indignant at the president's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives on Tuesday announced preparations for an impeachment process against Trump. Their charges are based based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who raises serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. After great public pressure, the whistleblower's accounts were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower allegedly received information from several government officials that the US president " uses the power of his office " to have another country interfere in his favor in the 2020 US election.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr-Zelensky in late July, where Trump Trump encouraged his counterpart to conduct investigations that could harm his political rival Joe Biden, about past deals of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is in the lead in the race for Democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of a cover-up with regard to the Ukraine phone call: Leading government officials had tried to keep the exact text wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic wording had been been prepared. However, after the conversation, after the conversation at the instruction of lawyers, had been removed from a usually provided database and had instead been stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The " New York Times " reported that it was an employee of the CIA foreign intelligence service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among others, that the " so-called whistleblower " had spread second-hand information that turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, there might be no tipsters or spies.
What Trump said in New York about those allegedly leaked information to the whistleblower provoked outrage. The chairman of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, was alarmed, complaining that Trump's statement once again undermined the administration's integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations have been underway against Trump and his environment in various committees for months. In view of the Ukraine accusations, the Democrats are now advforward investigations with new force in order to start a possible impeachment procedure against Trump.
" The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation, " said the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff.. Trump sharply attacked Schiff, accused him of a misrepresentation of things and once again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly berults Schiff Schiff and had already called for his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US security foreign-policy officials, working mostly under Democratic and Republican-@-@ presidents, backed the Democratic-led investigation into possible impeachment in a statement released on Friday. If the allegations came true, it would be " " unscrupulous abuse of power " by Trump.
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could institute a so-called impeachment procedure. The decision on an actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The chances of success such a procedure are low. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
VW Works Council: Jobs are being abolished " stealthily "
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe, a concern that is driving the car manufacturer's works council. The brand intends to reduce its annual costs from ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023, of which 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
A key to achieving this is personnel costs. The " Future Pact " negotiated between company and works council in 2016 provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020 already. As a general rule, a job can only be elimshed at the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, a protection of employment apply until 2029.
However our newspaper has learlearned from the works council that jobs in production, which would not actually be on offer, are " creeping " dismantled via another route - that is, missing the official course. Thus, the regular positions that become vacant would often not be filled.
In these cases the works council had no way to force out the reoccupation. Meanwhile, there are no staff in many places, the work density is increasing, the worries about a gradual bleed-@-@ out of the vehicle plants are greater. Thus, the fear that the vehicle production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. From VW, it was only: " An adjustment of the employment volume is, as agreed, socially acceptable ably along the demographic curve. "
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more and centrally new projects centrally. This is also intended to reduce costs costs and accelerate decisions - behind this, the goal is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Managing Director of Production Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: " Especially in uncertain times, from Brexit to the impending trade war between the USA and China, we are well-advised to make ourselves crisis-proof. "
There has already been success in this way: for example, this year, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle fall compared to the previous year. Speaking to journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, to be presented in Wolfsburg on October 24th, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on production time does not mention VW, according to information in our newspaper, it amounts to the Golf 7 approximately
20
The Wolfsburg's production plant in our region is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter production plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the VW rule of thumb is that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year for the plant to be satisfacfactorily profitable. In 2018, capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to declining demand for diesel engines and the problems with switching to the new fuel and exhaust gas testing procedure WLTP.
However, as Chief Production Officer Tostmann announced last year, one million cars are expected to roll off the line in Wolfsburg " in perspective. " This is to enable the bundling of golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is handing over golf production by the conversion to a location for e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tarraco and Tiguan (seat) are produced in Wolfsburg, Germany. However, the sales of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, the expectations are now on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build the e-mobility, it should remain for the time being the bread and-butter car of Wolfsburg.
Forced into prostitution with voodoo: traffickers sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been swored, sent to the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six alleged traffickers have been sent to jail.
Six suspected traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and up to up to eight and three months' imprisonment in BochBochumum On Friday, the accused had smuelled young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr and were forced into prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerians willing to leave the country had to take a ritual oath at home in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smuggers in rubber boats. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to work off the alleged lock costs of an average of 25,000 euros. Therefore, the wages was completely taken from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the smuggling and subsequent distribution of young Nigerian brothels to women women on trial. " The work made the women physically and mentally difficult, " said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. " Some were really disgusted. "
The sentences are commercial and gang smuggling of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the long-term dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendants' union UFO has once again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will " provide information on the industrial action taken in the LH Group on 14 October, " Daniel Flohr, member of the Ufor UBoard, said on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been using to conduct collective bargaining with Ufo for months, including the question of whether the union has lawfully terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
In this point, Ufo is now strengthened after a decision of the Labour Court in Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to have it established that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and is whether to lodge appeals against it. " I think it is unlikely that a second court sees the matter as completely different, " said Ufo board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the State Labour Court in Frankfurt for a judicial review of the status of the UFO as a trade union.The company argues that the trade union has not appointed a qualified executive board for months and is therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce dispute over leadership in the trade union, during which numerous members of the board of directors and the advisory board resigned, including the long-time union head Nicoley Baublies. Owing to the doubts about its leadership the UFO had suspended suspended a balhad already begun on strikes by Eurowings cabin personnel at the end of July.
Entry easier: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet. But that is about to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
Saudi Arabia's new visa system aims to attract more international tourists in future. By 2030, it wants to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, said the Tourism Commission.
" The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is an historic moment for our country, " said the Chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Khatib.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually only awarded for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes more income from the tourism business. According to its statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones hit two of the major oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churai oil field. As a result, national oil production collapsed significantly, and oil price skyrocketed. It should take several weeks for the Kingdom's oil production to return to its old level.

Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
Apart from pests ests, diseases, resident alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat reported the World ConConservation Union (IUCN) on Friday in Brussels. It examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of these do not occur on any other continent. 58 per cent of these 265 are endangered. 66 are already at the highest level of endangerment and thus facing extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from " potentially endangered " to " endangered, " " highly endangered, " " critically endangered, " and " extinct in nature " to " extinct. " Overall, the IUCN lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as endangered.
Rowan and wild horse chestnut endangered
In Germany, especially rowans (Sorbus) are threatened, " one of the authors, David Allen, told the German Press Agency. " Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway or due to the transformation or weakening of their habitats. "
It also looks bad for the wild, common, horse chestnuts. Since 2017 they have been considered " endangered, " level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat next to a mushroom is is Balkan Balkan mine moth. Since the 1980s it spspread from from southeast Europe across the entire continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild, un, horse chestnuts (Aesculus hipocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 specimens. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Shrub species and mosses are also endangered
The IUCN scientists also drew up new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs, and mosses. More than a fifth of molluscs and mosses, and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practises, and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
" This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet, " said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europe Bureau. " We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority. "
Istanbul earthquake: 34 casualties reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. According to the data there were no deaths. Dozens of people would have had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have therefore been damaged. Since the earthquake the day before, there were almost 200 aftershocks. On Thursday, the earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul and triggered panic in the metropolis with its millions million people.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes announced Oktktay. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered particularly earthquake endangered. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called Northern Anatolian Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate.
One of the most severe quakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 near Istanbul in 1999. The epicenter was then in Gölcük, southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
On Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 earthquake had already shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the residents to stay away from the damaged buildings.

Fight against falling spectators
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you have dropped audience ratings most recently: this February, the spectacle in the USA attracted the least number of viewers in more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
There had been uproar about the previous Super Bowl half-time show: According to media reports, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform last February over dealing with quarterback ColColin Kaepernick Cardi B. Finally, the pop group Maroon on 5 led the half-time show - the reviews were not friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had fallen to his knees in the 2016 / 17 season before the NFL games in the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. Kaepernick ick triggered a movement, numerous players adopted the gesture. This caused a stir, US President Donald Trump sharply attacked the mostly African-American football stars. Kaeperpernick himself is been agreed since March 2017, and no longer has an NFL game. He accuses the clubs of not want to hire him for political reasons.
Cook bust: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to pay much for the failure of travel provider Thomas Cook Cook. High write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans are imimminent. This also affects Credit Suisse, writes the Financial Times in its Friday edition.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to write down a total of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (around EUR 2 billion) on their books, according to the report, according to estimates by the consulting firm AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept write-offs of £900 million to 1 billion and the lenders between £550 and 825 million. The actual write-off amounts are more likely to be at the upper end of the range, an expert told the paper.
How great the creditors' losses will actually be in the end will show after expiry of the insolvency cy proceedings. A person close to this procedure did not spread too much hope. Thus, for example, the approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in Great Britain are " old " and many of the properties are in bad locations. It was said that the the most money can be get out with the sale of the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand.
Rackete allegedly brought alleged murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. " We cannot rule this out, but we have no reliable information about it ourselves, " said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the dpa news agency.
Other migrants recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The supposed perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they were leaving on their ships. " They come without passports. "

USA warns government against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great, " Pai told Handelsblatt with regard to the development of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a " national security law " that obliges every corporation " under Chinese jurisdiction " to follow the instructions of the security forces.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, " continued the FCC head, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to require suppliers a " declaration of trustworthiness. "
Berlin will first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the " Handelsblatt, " citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology is not just about hardware:
It is the software that is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of code that change over time, " Pai said.
It is " very hard to imagine " that a government agency, " no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks, " the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership structure are opaque. The employee company, which allegedly owns the company, is not necessarily independent of the government, " Pai told the " Handelsblatt. "
The United States has findings according to which government government employees are placed within the company. Pai recently held talks in Berlin to promote the United States' position.
Chemical factory in northern France on fire: Schools closed
At night, local residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open Friday as a precaution, informed the responsible prefecture. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to be exposed to smoke. There were no casualties, farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals inside, protect their feed and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that odor would spread after the deletion, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters as well as 90 police and gendarmes were deployed at the fire.
A gigantic black column of smoke had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported gigantic flames and explosions in the Lubrizol factory, which produces oil additives. The production plant is located a few kilometres from the city centre.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites that are particularly monitored. Seveso, Milan, near Italy, suffered a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The region André Durand Prefect, Pierre Pierre-André Durand told the news caster BFMTV that it had initially initially found no " high toxicity " in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine Seine could not be excluded. In the river, dams had been built against pollution, explained the Prefecture.
The fire broke out early in the morning at around 2.40 am, the authorities reported. Initially the cause remained unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine River between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: " Germany must invest now "
French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called for greater investment by Germany to boost economic growth in the Eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner sooner the better, " said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for next year.
The eurozone economy is weakening, warned the minister.
We cannot wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions. "
Those states that have budgetary scope for more investment must act, said Le Maire, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the minister added, pointing to its country's high public debt, which is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. French public debt must be " stabilised " and " reduced, " said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly made appeals to Germany to make more public investments in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get a grip on its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
Among other things, the French government is responding to the protests of the Yellow Vest Movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, after an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson evades question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticizes the " Surrender law " passed by the parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British prime Minister to avoid a chaotic Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still make use of a loophole. However, when asked about this possibility, the Tory politician evades dges.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is cautious about whether he wants to implement an unregulated Brexit - despite the law recently passed by parliament, which is supposed to prevent that. In response to a corresponding question, Johnson only told journalists that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement has been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a " capitrender law, " which makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the new law. Prime Minister could use a procedural triloy to postpone the entry into force of the law after the withdrawal from the EU. Mr Johnson said he is to for a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way forward is to reach an agreement. "
Meanwhile, Johnson's advisor Dominic Cummings, chief of er, said that he perceived the political dispute over Brexit as a " walk in the park " and was confident that the desired exit from the EU will still come about: " We will enjoy it, we will win it, we will leave the EU, not to worry, " Cummings told the British newspaper " Telegraph " at a book launch.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign " Vote Leave " during the campaign campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, is now chief strategist in the British government Downing Street. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.

Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found her way to photography, always had the camera with her her. She made thousands of Polaroids, several hundred of which are now being published for the first time in " The Polaroid Diaries. "
There are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. " She wanted real moments, " writes the art critic, Ekow Eshun, in his preface. And of course, one is always in the center: her husband Paul - as one have have never seen before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulder, makes the phone in a bathrobe with a plastic bag on his head or wears misshapen moon boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotdlight on their farm in southern England or in Scotland, they also led a normal life. So Mary McCartney said, according to the BBC that she slept as a baby in a bed her father had made from old-oned potato boxes. And it hasn't always been easy with the McCartneys.
Like no other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's photographs are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to take it at exactly the right moment, " said Paul McCartney. " If you take two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo. " And Linda would have had the ability to capture exactly the right moment. " She just knew she had it, " Paul said in the Eshun essay.
There, the light, the composition, the image detail and the colors are right, which makes " The Polaroid Diaries " not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but apart to everything anecdotal is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes sometimes look like abstract paintings.The perfect complement to the just rereleased Beatles album " Abbey Road, " which was released exactly 50 years ago.
" We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran "
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighbouring country despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, " Erdogan said in New York, where he participated in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems with importing Iranian crude oil, as some companies had " withdrawn because of US threats. "
Nevertheless, Turkey will will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues " said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has been pursuing a policy of " maximum pressure " on the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not adying to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have escalated considerably.
US government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically limit the reception of refugees. The US Department of State declared on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, corresponding to a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department stated that while the US continues to be committed to supporting refugees, its most important task is to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is over-burdened.
The US government wants to focus on hosting two groups of refugees: people who are being persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have been put in risk, according to the statement by the State Department. contrast, the it plans to host a maximum of 1,500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
The program, launched in 1980, selected refugees from UN camps around the world, and has are resettled in the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. The current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When US President Donald Trump's predecessor Barack Obama left the White House, the number was almost 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted appror to the announced reduction of the ceiling. " This is a very sad day for America, " said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would thus further damage its leadership role in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to restrict immigration to the US, both legally and illegally. According, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - " Get close to a spy "
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of the whistleblower affair of spying whistever lower has attried appropriate information to the informant who accuses him of abuse of power, " comes close to a spy, " Trump said according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. This, several U.S. media reports in agreement.
Trump spoke to employees of the American UN mission. When he was asked about the person who informed the whistleble-leblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, " That comes close to a spy. " Then Trump added, " Do you know what we did in old times, when we were smart? Correct. The spies and betrayals, we used to deal with it a bit from what we do now. "
Observers evaluated the latter comment as a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats strongly criticised Trump's statements and also accused him of intimidating witnesses. It was also an attempt to hinder a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment process, wrote the chairof committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Supervision in the House of Representatives.
In a complaint now published accuses whwhistleblower the president having abused his office to request interference of another country in the 2020 US election. Specifically, it is among other things about his controversial telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in the summer: In the conversation, Trump advised him to start an investigation against his possible Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in the Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who the whistle blower himself and his informant are. However, the New York Times reports that the whistle blower is be an analyst of the foreign intelligence CIA.
Refugee boat capsized: Baby and toddlers drown in Aegean Sea

Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets shake
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from a small startup to a driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear for billions in revenues.
The crisis of the office lessor WeWork threatens to disturrupt the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. A few days ago the company had removed founder Adam Neumann as CEO, the company had postponed the planned IPO and started the sale of subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for executives in order to gain financial space for the coming weeks and months. Furthermore, the British " Financial Times " reports among others, has stopped WeWork of new leases with an immediate effect. Thus, among other, in New York and London, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly off the market.
WeWork rents large office spaces in the long term and rents them at short notice in some small units to members. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far WeWork burns money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company made a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with sales of 1.8 billion dollars. This year, the rental costs of renting new of large areas alone are said to rise to an estimated 2.5 billion U.S. dollars. To limit the loss the new corporate management is said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped the rental of new spaces with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with maturities of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by the economist Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24. WeWorks new contracts alone meant that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the space brought on the market at that time. Without WeWorks Expansion, the office vacancy rate in the metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in the " Business Insider. " The situation is similar in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in their prime locations.
In the British capital, too, the real estate market balance could significantly considerably without further expansion by the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant tenant in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis purchased last year by savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties to meet the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have write off part of the expected billions in revenue. They do not have access to - scarce - reserves reserves of WeWork despite the long-term rental contracts. Rental enting the individual WeWelocations is usually only done by specially founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia Again Arrested Numerous North Korean Fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 poachers have been arrested who had fished illegally in the waters, reported the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB told the Interfax agency on Friday.

The Russian Fisheries Agency had not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans earlier this year, following complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea had already been temporarily arrested there in 2019.
The head of the Kiev Association of Russian Fishing Companies in the Far East Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently complained about high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These also even small creatures to be be removed from the sea. Moreover, the nets are simply disposed in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed. Also, the ships themselves do not comply with the hygienic and technical regulations.

On that September September, Russian border guards first arrested one North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire.
The United States imposes travel ban on ex-President Castro
The US has imposed a travel ban on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, which the US State Department explained in a statement Thursday Thursday Castro's involvement in " gross human rights violations. " As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he presides over a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there by supporting Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro. " The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela, " tweeted American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump had issued entry bans on people including members of the Venezuelan government and military on Wednesday. A fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging in Venezuela for months. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions on Maduro's government to bring him to his knees and bring the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents of the government.
Fridays for Future climate protests
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people again want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again plans actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide, due of the time difference in New Zealand and Australia, before the protests spread across Europe to North America. Climate activist Greta Thunberg there wanted to attend a large rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How great the worldwide popularity will be this Friday after the record participation of last week, is relatively unclear. Thunberg herself was in good spirits. " Last Friday, more than four million people stristrike for the climate. This Friday, we do it once again!, " she wrote on Twitter. So far in the context of the strike week, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
Especially in Germany the influx was very large last Friday. A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - about 1.4 million - took participated in the protests in 575 cities estimated in Fridays for Future. According according to a list of the movement, demonstrations are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolicities like Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne Cologne but also in smaller municipalities and cities like Jüchen in Jüchen chen WestWestWestWestWestWestWestWestWestWesterland WestWesterland Westerland want to demonstrate for the climate on Sylt.
At the age of 15, Thunberg Thunberg sat down before the Swedish Parliament in August of 2018, to urge the politicians of her country to a stronger commitment to climate protection. This gave rise to the Fridays for Future Future movement within a short time.Pupils and students are participating in the climate protests, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together they demand more ambition from the politicians in the fight against global warming and the imminent climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming has to be contained to below 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial period.
After a two-week transatlantic cruise, ThThunberg arrived in New York almost a month ago on a racing yacht yacht where she recently participated in climate protests and UN summits. Monday Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN in which she spoke a efully to the world's heads of state and government. In her native city on Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of Right LiLivelihihood Foundation for more livelihood protection.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This provides for a change in fire protection. " This also applies to smoking, " said a spokesman for the Emergency Ministry on Thursday, according to the Tass agency in Moscow. The ban is scheduled to come into force on 1 October.

Blow against cybercriminals - Investigators pick up servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators found for the first time a large server provider for illegal transactions on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, through which internationally active criminals conducted their machinations.
This was announced by the Prosecutor General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
The suspects' customers are said to be the operators of the second-largest darknet marketplace for drugs, " Wall Street Market, " which investigators had broken up in the spring. According to the General Public Prosecutor's Office, the attack on 1.25 million routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyberbunker.
Such a hoster was excavated for the first time in Germany, it said. A webhoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access action with the support of special forces such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and neighboring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigation. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New Global Climate Protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people again want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-West@-@ WestWestWestWesterland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests ǀ Who are Thunberg's backers?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. So all the more astonishing that a 16-year-old girl of all people holds the mirror in the face of the people man of power of her time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and gets young people to stand up for a better climate friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win over a collection of children and young people for himself. As early as 121212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to stand up for a more just world. At that time, he was able to win over a crowd of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea to get into the Promised Land, just as Greta Thunberg recently set out on a trip to America with a sailboat.
But is there a dark side in this regard? Why does it take an action called " We don't have time " to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which has sold extensively, thanks to the daughter in the limelight. Even long-standing followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignindignant about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably also too thick for some successors. This is also not un, because the action was in the media the world very well to the money and a lot of money flows thanks to the imposing action.
Here, the minds now now de: Is it morally right to enrich yourself financially while saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world's rescue operation? No matter which position is ultimately taken in the process, a critical and reflected point of view is always more important in a democratic society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make perfect sense to question critically even apparently pious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crosses Through Our Solar System
A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: a foreign comet is currently passing through our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star is intersecting our solar system. It was named 2I / Borisov after its discoverer and is currently employying astronomers all over the world.
2I / Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov in the Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further subsequent observations have confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was sighted during flying.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get glimpses of a foreign solar system from close up. Apparently, the Kommet is similar to those of our own system, according to the astrophysical institute of the Canaries. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is of of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperpole orbit that leads it out of our system.
Comet was sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it comes,, the astronomers can observe it in detail because, unlike its predecessor, the 2I / Borisov has already been seen in its approach, which means that it can be examined from Earth for many months. The object will reach its greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020, " explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa. " Thereafter, until October 2020, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes. "
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 " Oumuamua. "
First findings about comet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to initial findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the comstar's spectrum is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual findings. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are preoccupied with asteroids. Only recently, a giant asteroid rushed past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
" Absolutely reprehensible " Rachel Johnson horrified by brother
Boris Johnson is becoming more lonesely. First, his younger brother left the cabinet, now his sister castigating, with clear words, the martial language of the prime minister as " tasteless. " It was not the brother she knew.
" Surrender, " " deception, " contract ": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is continuing to arm - at least verbally. At the Question Time in the House of Commons on this Wednesday, massive outrage of the opposition was met, and in the meantime other critics have also spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well journalist known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother was using words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be " hanged, progged, quartered, tarred and feathered. " She considers this to be extremely rerehenhensible and that she does not recognise her brother's version, said MP Rachel Johnson sons who had run in the the EU elections for the anti-Brexit party Change U..
She was particularly offended by her brother mentionJo Cox, a pro-EU Member of Parliament, who had been murdered in 2016 by a neo-days before the 2016 Brexit referendum. As Boris Boris Johnson said in the House of Commons, her memory could best be remembered by going through Brexit. " Its very tasteless to refer to an MP murdered by someone who shouted " Britain first, " now criticized Johnson's sister. Apparently, the perpetrator came from the extreme right right camp that felt emortened " by this kind of language. " It was very very tastful for all who mourned for her.
The Cox widox also severely criticized the Prime Minister. " It makes me sick when Jo's name is used in this way, " he tweet.The best way to honor her is to stand up passionately and resolutely vely what you believe in - no matter what view you are. However, one is never allowed to " demonize the other side. " He also complained that an atmosphere had emerged in which attacks became more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned from his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory deputy. " In recent months I have been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest - it is indissoluble tension, " said Jo Johnson, justiaining the move.
Johnson's language also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As the Times reports, all the 118 bishops, and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is " not worthy of this country. " In a joint statement they declared: " In the past days, the language was unacceptable, both in debates and outside parliament. We should speak to each other with respect. "

Latina power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming final of the US football league league NFL, the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).

The metropolis located on the southern tip of Florida is home to many people with Latin American roots. Shakira (" Waka Waka ") comes from Colombia, Lopez (" On the Floor ") is of Puerto Rican origin.

The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico.

Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single " Whenever, Whereever. "
The announcement of the mid-term guests is eagerly awaited every time in the USA. This year many see the selection as a political gesture too. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sports event and at the same time a gigantic advertising event. MusiMusicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, over 100 million television viewers watch at the NFL finale, and it is now extremely popular in Germany.

Out of solidarity solidarity had with Kaepernick some musicians refused a Super Bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink Pink. That the rock group Maroon 5 was performing, was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber attacks Egypt's Ruler: But for the time being, Mohamed prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have influence on whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt both spent the past week abroad. One was hovering back at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfaattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who deposed the country's Muslim Brotherhood Mohammed Morsi in 2013's first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's crackdown against political Islam and not lost a syllable about the human rights violations on the NNile - in a week, in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had " no reason to worry, " said he, in the micro-ones of state television at the airport. " The Egyptians will not be misled. "
The other man, who currently determines the events in the streets, tries mislead - according to the President. Of course Mohamed Ali remained abroad, where he escapades the grip of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him, if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, as actor, the 45-year-old was known only to a minority of Egyptians. Today he is the dominant voice that dominated the political discourse in the country, cafés, living rooms and tea rooms: With his YouTube channel, " Mohammed's Secrets " Ali calls on his countrymen to rise up against Sisi.
He approaches the head of state directly and in a quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president revels in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it is there. The army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he was doing business with these gentlemen in his second job as a builder for 15 years, he seems to know pretty exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many of the Egyptians, as the almost exploding click numbers show.
After last week thousands had demonstrated against his rule for the first time since Sisi had seized power, and almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawand and opposition politicians were arrested, Ali called for a " million-dollar march " this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would really venture into the streets. However, there were a few minor protests, for example in Giza near Cairo and in the town of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests whose participants accused Al-Sisisi of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos could not initially be independently verified. The security circles said that the police had ended the protests.
A massive police presence was reported from the city of the Mansura in the ile Delta Delta where demonstrators tore apart banners with the portrait of the president on the Friday. Security forces erected checkpoint checkpoints in the city and on the main roads. In the Cairo, subway stations in the city center were closed because of " maintenance work, " most streets around the Tahrir Square, heart of the revolution 2011, were blocked. And in the Rabaa Square, where in 2013 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood Mursi entrentrenched, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent disdisfrom gathering: Sisi's future party wanted to hold a large rally for the president.
Mohamed Ali caused this to change his tactics: " Our goal does not have to be the Tahrir Square., " Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. " Let's not meet with police officers. " But cannot be understood as a retreat: " All of Egypt is the Tahrir Square. "
When provider promises too much
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options.
Who concludes an Internet contract, does not have blindly to trust the speed data of the offers. customers can check with with abnormalities themselves, how much of it is actually reached.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a contract component and should therefore be achieved, explains the Verbraucherzentrale Bayern.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. The measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
" The tests of the offerers take place however after offerer-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated, " gives the consumer authority Bavaria to be out on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of usually 14 days for the provider to produce the promised service. Affected parties best do this in writing by an objection letter.
If this does not work even after multiple requests, customers can terminate and possibly also claim damages. However, in the absence of success, only the course of action will help.
First Senior Republican to Investigate
Vermont's Governor was the first high ranking Republican to advocate an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are established, " said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday, wants to know more about the whistle-leblower affair before action - an impeachment trial can lead to the removal of the president - is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Because Trump had been watching Biden " for years. "
Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have shown uneasease about it. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party.

While capsizing a refugee boat in the Aegean, a baby and four other children drowned. Altogether seven people died in the accident, according to the Greek Coast Guard on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.

In return, the EU wanted to take in a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian being deported.
However, the processing of asylum applications is very difficult on the Greek side due to the lack of personnel.

On the party's website she could be seen on a photo with this mug, talking to citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also spread to the media - and then the cup was a a nasty (cardboard) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Party leader must answer for photo breakdown
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and producing the party ffake news to appear more credible on the subject of " environmental protection " in the middle of a general election campaign in which Trudeau is finding it increasingly difficult because of a bribery scandal.

May writes that she is sorry for the employee who has done that. " I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to conceal, " she says to the Guardian, and at the same time asked for something from her over-committed team: " If they feel like working on a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face to make me look younger?

Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was promised an upgrade by e-mail from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Getting an upgrade for Business Class spontaneously is something that many passengers dream of. Sometimes they are lucky and the check-in staff offer a change from Economy Class free of charge.
This case, however, shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer actively asked the airline Cathay-Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng is followed by more than 65,000 users. On 30 May she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on 7 June.
On the outward flight, the employees refused Jaqueline an upgrade, even though she had shown a mail in which Cathay Pacific allegedly promised her an upgrade. The influencer claims to have received the letter from a marketing employee of the airline. However, the airline accuses Jaqueline of falforfied the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at JFK airport were sceptical: They checked at the headquarters. And indeed, the employee, from whom the mail alleoriginated, is said to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline staff at the airport cancelled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new flight tick to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests. Although Cathay had reimbursed her the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also asked back the costs of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. The terms and conditions of the airline also state that it does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline is not satisfied with this - and now enges a lawyer.
Oil Prices Decline according to ceasefire report in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday in in a short time. Recently, a barrel (15.9 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price of a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
The trigger was a report by the Wall-Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in Saudi Arabia had halted five percent of global oil production in mid-September. Houthi rebels, who are allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen, had claimed the for kes. Saudi Arabia blames Iran, as does the US government, and a ceasefire that would defuse political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, the focus can be on growth and worry about demand, said Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank's Bloomberg omberg.
Oil prices are thus continuing their downward movement of the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost as much as $59, and Brent almost $65.
According to the Bloomberg insider, Bloomberg recently reported that repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia is moving faster than expected after the attack in mid-September. Accordingly, the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back towards the original quantity.
Most recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders who report on the rapid progress of the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was a sign of some asing in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " is on its way more than two months after the by Iran and the recently granted release to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship is still at anchor, the shipping owner Erik Hånell told the Swedish radio in an SMS on Friday morning.
But the US has announced it will transfer defensive missiles and soldiers to Iran's arch-enemy in Saudi Arabia. Fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the United Kingdom has temporarily driven up oil prices in recent weeks.
Charges against Trump intensify
In the affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, cover-up allegations were made against the White House. Several leading government officials had made intensiefforts to prevent access to the wording version of the conversation following a controversial telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymymyr Zelensky at the end of July, said an anonymous whlebleblower. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused a " cover-up " against the White House. Trump spoke of a " witch-hunt. "
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit of ruler Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon occur in the nuclear dispute. The sense and prospects of success of such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing the agreements of the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to KCNA.
The US had done far so far to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the advisor of the North Korean Department of State. He also criticized US-sanctions and the joint military-manoeuvre of the US and South Korea. But he hoped in a " wise and " courageous " decision of Trump so that there is rapprochement.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he agreed to it. Negotiations on disarmament of North Korea's nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second-Trump-second summit in Hanoi in February, and the two countries met in the Demilitarized Zone later in June, agreeing to revive the talks, but so far without much success.

Pound Under Pressure - Rate Reduction Expected
Pound under pressure
In the face of an impending rate cut, the pound is depreciating against the euro.
Speculation that the Bank of England (BoE) will soon cut rates rates down is hitting the pound sterling ling, with British currency falling by as much as 0.4% to $1.2269 on Friday.
The trigger for the sales were statements by central banker Michael Saunders. He brought an interest rate cut into the conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit can be averted, as the uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, as Saunders is considered an advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista from brokerage house ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England pointed out the burdens on the economy of the Brexit hickering without directly signaling an interest rate cut. If necessary, Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU on October 31 even without a divorce agreement.
More: The British Prime Minister has taken a high risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proven
Material from the Moscow analytical laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the World Athletics Federation.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details about the doping scandal in Russia are being revealed - and they destroy the little of credibility that Russian sports had recovered, even to some extent, at the beginning of the year. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti Doping Agency (Wada) .Now it turned out that they were falsified.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in the Russian sport was revealed. Consequently, Wada had subsequently banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time Russian athletes were not completely banished from the world stage. After an individual examination, the International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes of the country compete under neutral flag at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio Rio, at the Winter Games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were part the the start. They were allowed to take participate in the World Cups in the various sports and in the summer even the sothe er World Cup took place in Russia with the host as participant.
Positive Findings Missing
The following September, Wada ada lifted Rusada ban ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and the samples in question. The data were intended to provide information on the possible extent of cover-up of doping cases in state doping ing. They were intended to help to subsequently punish athletes, and were finally delivered three months later.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analytical laboratory have been manipulated. " Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the correct data, " said David HHowman in an interview Friday with " Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. " " We have noted a number of discrepancy between data from the Wada from a whistleblower whistleblower and those it received from the Russians in January. " Many positive findings were missing that were mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup not affected
This is the confirmation of the IAAF's stance: The Athletics Federation is the only organisation that is heres to the spell of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes will compete under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
Earlier this week, Wada had already made manipulations and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening to ban the Rusada again and, in the worst case, its expulsion from the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
