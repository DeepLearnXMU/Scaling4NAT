Pudle solved: That's why we cannot tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found found out with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. ProProgress has also been made on the question of why children defend themselves so violently against the tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it was shown why just the approach of a tickling hand causes laughter before the touch. This is due to a deep layer in the cerebrum that already causes the laughter.
According to earlier research showed that rats react with " laughter " in the ultrasound range when they tickled by humans. This " laughter " is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-contact
So far it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-contact and contact by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers have now found in the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-contact. This, this also the case when living beings clean themselves. However, during foreign foreign and and the tickling by the scientists,, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh have been increased.
But if the self-contact and the touch by others happen at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that that the brain of the rat could not distinguish between the self-contact and the touch by other. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves, because the self-touch activates a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. Therefore they sometimes broke this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showed showed escape behavior or anxness. This ambivalence is like the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.

Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate brought no solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one problem less. The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " held in Iran was able to set sasea again. It could be a piece of piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Rhani.
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero, " been detained in the Strait HorHormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The " Stena Impero " has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, said shipping company boss Erik Hånell. Around noon the ship had left Iranian waters. " Good nice that it is over, " he told the Swedish television station SVT.
The Foreign Ministry in London described the fixing of the ship as illegal. " This is part of a pattern of attempts to compromise the freedom of the oceans. We are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law, " said a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on 19 July on the charge of disating regulations of the law of the sea sea the Persian Gulf Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing according with the circumstances,, Hånell said They had behaved professionally in view of the difficult and exhausting situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them back with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected behind the fixing of the " Stena Impero " a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar:, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which supposed to been intended intended for Syria, been chat the beginning of July. According the authorities, the delivery violated EU EU sanctions against warwar country Syria. The British had received reference of the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of " piracy " and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the " Adrian Darya-1 " was finally released. Asjections that it was a barter to free the " Stena Impero, " London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world oil exports is shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have worcalated immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping was dragged into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute of both countries. Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of trying to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects jects this. The US singwithdrew from the international nuclear agreement in 2018, which should prevent Iran Iran from building a nuclear bomb and end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been pushing the leadership in Tehran under with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a stricter and extended agreement to other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the " Stena Impero " and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of commercial ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented to the UN General Assembly in New York a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz. With the initiative " Coalition of Hope " for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection powers to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is destroying a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
India would be predestined ined a " war profiteer. " Given the punitive tariffs that America's President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to retheir plan. Chief Offics of Asian companies that are considering relocating their production from China to another country, ite India as one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS BS.. Of, this is not only only to do with the onderables of the Sino-American trade war. Indeed, with a huge pool of young workers and a internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems like created to play a more significant role in the globally fied fied production chain.
But India itself has now into Trump's focus. Disjoringly called the " kingdom of tariffs " by the warhorse in the White House, America withdrew the emerging country's trade benefits for 2,000 products at the beginning of June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, the friction with India are certainly only a sideshow. Moreover, America also at the world largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington are the concerned about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salvo of American punitive tariffs India seems unlikely. India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just taken a a second five-year term, should therefore weigh in safety.
The problem, however, lies in another place: the empirically substantiated thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult position in the socialist Republic of India. Under Modi. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness, which stitherated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies are now receiving building permits for buildings buildings more quickly. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more taner insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the prerequisconditions for liquidating seemdead companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic standpoint, a lot has changed for the better in India in the first five mode years. However, this does not true in trade policy. Encourated by this fact to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even erected new barriers.
In the West, Modi depends the the ra of of energetic reformer who radicradically ews his country. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime knows all too well what which vocabulary pleWestern managers. However, in essence, the " India First " lawyer has never moved away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen men who survive thanks to the closure of their industries are among the the regular voters of Modi's nationalist BharatiJanata Party and applauthis short-sighted policy.

Online retailers: Mail order should be able to donate returns easier
For online retailers, many returned packages are are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products, instead of destroying them.
Although companies could not exempted from sales tax on donations in kind, the ministry explained on a question of the Green parliamentary group, on which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, the dealcould set the market value of of unsellable returns so low that they would have to pay no or little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens return every sixth paret when orders on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then ended ended up in the waste. Dondonate them would cost companies additional money according to current legal situation, because the tax authorities evaluate donations in kind such as sales, on which then VAT then incurred.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make clarify with a decree that companies can evaluate non-saleable products accordingly and donate them free-profit to free of charge.

The well-known work of street art star Banksy, " Devolved Parliament, " will be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines " the regression of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the attitude dominated by animals and tribes. " Starting Saturday Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital, until it is to be auctioned off on 3 October. The painting is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in South western Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had exhibited the painting again - coinciding with the original Brexit date on 29 29. On this occasion, the, which formerly called called " Question Time, " was renamed " Devolved Parliament. "
The picture could change hands for a sum of dollars.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday at the first meeting of the House of Commons after the relifting of a forced imposed imposed by by the Supreme Court had a hard hard lash with the opposition. Johnson wants to implement the already postponed Brexit on 31 October if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has intervened in the Brexit debate. In Dover, the south-east of England, he painted a picture of a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. The plant is seen by thousands of of truck drivers and visitors entering the UK every day.
Brexit debate is like a " walk in the park "
The violent verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a " walk in the park, " Dominic Cummings said at a book presentation on Friday. " We enjoy it. We will (from the EU) and we will win. "
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days, accusing them of " betrayal " the people. Acclegations that he he could put MPs in danger because they could become the target of death threats, he dismissed as a " humbug. "
Cummings said that the only way to bring ain calm was when the MEPs would finally respect the British of' decision to leave the EU. It was not surprising that people were upset set that the UK still has not not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church on Friday called for restraint. " We should talk to each other with respect, " it said a statement. " And we should also listen. "
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN Interference in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the ashmir conflict during his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN general debate in New York. " If this goes badly, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst. " The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. " You should have prevented that. "
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India deprived the Indian Kashmir region of autonomy status and thus suddenly increased tensions in relations with Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo call for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government reacts to the current protests in Egypt with a hard hand. It lets shooting at the population with live ammunition, more than 2000 arrested join the prisons with the 60,000 political prisoners who are already detained there. Protesting has never been harmless in Egypt. But since the coming to power of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing possible to avoid a scenario like the times of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the bad economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by their own government drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that even the regime of el Sisi does not get under control, no matter how hard it goes on on opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is at ten percent. Who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, must decide who to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, also the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It is always critical when large parts of the population have difficulty having to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER boss: No more " showstoppers " for the city airport
For two months it was examined whether the complicated mesh of systems works in interaction with the BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the progress. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October of year. This is is certain, said supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed inspection, but also said there were still defects in the terminal to work off. " We have many detail topics, but we do not have a real showstopper. " He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The completion completion notice is now be submitted to the the office in the course of the quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year this was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of shortnesses in power cables have to be resolved; the Tüv wants to examine them by February. " In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, work work has to be intensiintensively on with the deficiencies, " said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no approval for all ddowels on which the cable routes hang. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
Furthermore, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not work satisfactorily. The problems had led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons, which go down like a canvas in a fire, so that the smoke does not spread. They drive down too far down. 36 engines therefore have to be replaced. Then, there there to be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and further construction defects as well as planning errors have ayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally it was scheduled to go into operation in 2011 Costs have increased since the start of construction from two billion to presumably around 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Since the passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. That is is the will be addressed at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on October October, as the Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial O Heike Fölster will join Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She had put the airport finances on firm footing.

In the midst of the price war with low-cost airlines such Lauda, WizWizAir,, asyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna, " confirmed Austrian Airlines spokesperson for Austrian A to APA. Previously, " AviationNetOnline " reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings is thus de facto to dissolved. Four of the seven Eurowings aircraft will remain in Vienna. AUA will take over from January January in the Wetlease ase, " 2020, including Eurowings personnel. Three Eurowings jets will now be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman explained. Flight times are to be coordinated to connecting flights. The aim is on the one hand, to strengthen the Vienna hub and on the other hand, to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna serves serves as a " production company " for the Group sister AUA. Among example,, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings device. Although the on-product product to be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants origincome from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights departing under AUA flight number AUA flight report are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but rather like the AUA in Terminal 3.
A price war broke upat Vienna Vienna Airport after the Nikbankruptcy. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced only on Thursday that to increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next sum. Therefore The Irish low-cost airline is sending four anair air aircraft with crews to Vienna, also in the so-called " Wetlease, " which criticzed the union as a bypass structure to the collective agreement.
To the of challenge by Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, Friday A AUAUCEO Andreas Otto on Friday: " We will remain the number one at the site in five, six or ten years. "

Study on the causes of heart disease
Smoking, being besity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers heart failure or infarction? Researchers in Hamburg now want to take close look at the genetic ome of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genetic ome of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to undown the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking countries, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the High Mountain Clinic Davos, which belongs to the Foundation and and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the main influsionable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known, it was. Now Now the scientists want to compare the complete genome of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University and ovascular Center at the UKE.
Currently in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes to the DNA - so-called mutations - are known, according to the hospital. About 200 200 are added every year.
According to the initiators, aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the the prevention, detection and treatment of heart arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be used in the research of other widespread diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, Head of the University Heart and Vasascular Center. New findings into the interplay between heart and brain, heart and kidneys as well as cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there is the firm will to use the data for research into other diseases. The clinic the the in Davos has so mainly mainly with allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be on the the medical campus and a professorship for bioinformatics will be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he was operated on an open heart in Hamburg Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The biosamples of healthy healthy participants come from Hamburgers who also participate in the " Hamburg City Health Study. " With 45,000 subjects, according to the hospital, this is the largest local health study in the world. When decoding genetic,, attention is is paid to the protection of anonymised data, the scientists assured. The is is one petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital of Zurich.
According to UKE, the genetic material of a human can be decicoded within 24 hours. The pure material costs for this were 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to start on 1 October, all 9,000 samples are to be analysed by the end end 2020. The tial results are results are in the following year.

World football selection: Further accusations after Messis and Klopps Freestyle
Football " Signature not valid "
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football baller election, accusations come to Fifa from other countries. Egypt was not evaluated at all - on a curious reason.
Much at FIFA has turned out to be disreputable in recent years: the World Cup awarments, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt function. However, however the Fifa world football election has so far not come under sussuspicof of unlean - if you apart from the fact that the national national coaches and national captains of the member associations often vote with sympathy than than an objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had complained that he did not voted at all, further inconsistencies are to light: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not taken into account account In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting overview.
Fifa apologizes in the extent that " the signatures on the election forms were given in capital letters and therefore not valid. " The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan's coach also amazed
There is also an outcry from the Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese federation that that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not voted as way it was finally evaluated: with LiLiel el Messi in place place with Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the was received just the way, with signatures and the official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also levaccusations: " Did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my vote is wrong, thank you, " he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
The message now now from the association on Friday: True, but of course was no intention. The completed election documents were " erroneously " provided with the name and the signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was said in a communication of the association. However, actually the second captain Manuel Rosas had been elected. " will taking the responsibility for the administrative error, " said in the message. But, Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had have voted for Messi " just as it is in the official list of FIFA. "
Fifa is now now the cases examined in an investigation, but stsizes that the election process was supervised externally by the consultancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. For that long, Lionel Messi will remain the undisputed winner of the world football baller election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: Republican high figures in call for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly called for an official investigation against US President and fellow party ate Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, " said Republican Governor of the US state of Vermont, Phil Scott. " Where this leads from from here will be determined by the facts that are determined. " He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. impeachment process can lead to the president's removal.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenkyi in a phone call to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been watching Biden " for years. "
Republicans have so far held ined from criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair, few have shown disdisbecause about it. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The the governor of Virginia had already turned against Trump's policies several, such as against relaxing asing environmental regulations and tightening tening immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, spoke in for the investigation. " It's a deeply disturbing situation, " Baker said. " The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it. "
As governor of US states, Scott and Baker have no formal say in the against Trump, which will being decided in Congress. Therefore Their statements are therefore mainly symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first Republican senators have also expressed critically of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, said that the case was " extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing. " US media, also report that first cracracks are opening among Republicans internally.
The affair could result in the opening of impeachment proceedings against Trump, the House of Democrats have announced an investigation, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no exact timetable for the impeachment. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make so-called impeachment. But the decision on actual impeachment would be in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. So the chances of success of such a process are low. So, no US president has been dismissed by an impeachment process.
Were torturers on board Rackete's " Sea Watch "?
Three men were arrested in Sicily, alleare to having raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had steed illegpermission with the rescue ship " " " " 3 3 " " 53 an refugees on board for 53 Libyof Lampedusa. After violent protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted again after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations are heard against rackets. Thus,, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have arrived in Italy with the " Sea-3 " " Italy. The suspects have been caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily), after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. " We cannot rule out, but but do have have reliable information about it, " " Sea Watch " spokesman Ruben Neugebauer told the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even the North African country. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). " The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence, " the statement said at the time.
NGOs and aid organizations are now poinout that they cannot exactly exactly who is coming on the ships. " We cannot scan who the people are. They come coming without passports, " said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why the are fleeing from Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there there are also perpetrators on ships ships " It is therefore very important that that this is investigated. "
Italy's right-wing former interior minister Matteo Salvini immediately demanded an apology from Rackete ete, who is still being under investigation in Italy for assiiding to illegal immigration.
Musk striires for delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given a strong boost to electric electric car on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter of 100,000 deliveries, " Musk wrote in an email sent to Tesla employees employees by the industry blog " Electrek. "
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, MusMusk's newcontinued. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the clientele To do this, Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out from trading with a increase of over than six percent. The price has not increased so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous record value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit figures be needed in the current and upcoming quarteryear. Above, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were been losses.
US budget dispute: Once again, only one bridge financing
The new fiscal year will begin in the United States on 1 1 without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has to to provide transitional funding until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in expenditure ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending spending plans before the new fiscal year starting on October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives Representatives on Thursday and decided a transition financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21. Without such a decision there would have been a ututat midnight on Monday, a partial of the federal administration. President Trump still yet to implement the decision.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration is now funded at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year ending on Monday. This is because Congress has not able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot for the time benefit from the expenditure framework from from 1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion for the new financial year.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have a majority, but the spending laws reflect priorities Democrats the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican dominated dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also more or less prepared ten of the twelve spending plans that can hardly have a majority.
The spirits differ mainly on the topic of resource allocation for the area of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the Wall, one of the big priorities of President Trump. The Democrats interfering with the Wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the the Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the construction of the the of divide
It, currently uncuncar how how the parties want to get closer on this issue. More probable than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November. Also,, a shdown down is not ruled out.
Against the background of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on time twelve twelve spending laws in time, and the associated danger of a shutdown, ideas for automate the process are gaining popularity. Subp. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the financing of the federal administration would automatically continue at the previous year's level, prevent the travel activities of parliamentarians and withstrain their wages until the new annual spending plans exist.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination should also be open to women and lesbiliving living alone: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a bill by the government, according to which all women can use in vitro fertilization ination This This should significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The substill still the the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that numerous " children without a father " could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also opposed to the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that defHealth Minister Agnès ès zyn n as an " opportunity for society. It depicreflects the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs of artificial insemination for all women should be borne by social security.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband further prohibited
With a narrow majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that would give widows access to the sperof their dead husband for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is allowed " post-mortem. " In Germany there have been cases in the past which women complained in vain for the release of the sperm of a deceased. Opponents of the advance in Paris argued that a child conceived this this then had a " particularly difficult fate. "
Many members of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on the move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the had had in ed for artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a " wirief would be imposed on a widow " if her desire to have child if the death of her husband remained unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it is unfair that a widow may in future be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, assisted insemination is permitted in France for heterosexual couples who cannot have eive children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had announced in the summer that surrogacy would continue to be banned.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single les or lesbian couples.

Universities should also be limited to flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion about postponed before the summer break about a climate tax on flights from universities and colleges is back momentmomentum. After State Rectors' Conference Conference reacted skeptically to a corresponding push from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral doctoral students from six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university plea for a compensation of official flights. This is a first step step " urgently necessary " " at the same time there must be a broad debate about the idability ability of flights, it says in their statement. The the cabinet decision originally originally planned in July is still on hold, because the CDU has still still not endorsed the submission of the Greens.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the secret service FSB, the arrested had fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was an exchange of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, and the fisherman succumbed to his serious injuries. This time, there were no casualties, it said.
Communist North Korea is ers from a chronic food shortage. North Korean fishermen were therefore traveling in Russian territorial waters, There, the Russian Coast Guard says it is on patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 octopus confiscated
During the renewed controls, 30,000 octopus were discovered on the boats and confiscated. Furthermore, according to information, three fishing and two motor boats were seized and brought to Nakodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year, after lawby local entrepreneurs, Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily arrested there to the media this year.
The head of the Association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern PrimorPrimor, Georgi Martynov, also recently complained high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. They would also bring small creatures out from the sea. In addition, nets would would simply be disposof in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed.
In the future only 18,000: USA lolower asylum ceiling
The " most generous nation in history ": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officials in the White House.
The richest country in the world is itself from people seeking protection: As Foreign Ministry confirms in Washington, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be lolowered. In future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will be granted asylum.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees ag. In the 2020 fiscal year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people will be allowed in,, as the US State Department declar. In the almost expired fiscal year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump's administration has drastically reduced the willingness to receive people seeking protection from all over the world in recent years. Under the ack Obama's previous administration there had been far higher reception limits.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee program in 1980. Yet the State Department described the US as " " most merciful and generous nation in history, " a phrase that strongly iscent of the idilance of the incumbent US president.
A " responsible handling " of refugees is aimed at that the refugees can return to their home countries to help with the reconstruction there, Trump explained. He receives a lot of support from supporters for his hard course in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of dispute is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to close off. To finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed a National Emergency. Whether there is a timing between the current current and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because the the ensensky affair and a possible threat pending impeachment proceedings.
According to statements from the Foreign Office, the US government wants to focus on accepreceiving two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis, who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, according to the statement of the State Department. However contrast, however maximum 1,1500 refugees refugees receive be refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The US wants to achieve in that people from this " northern triangle " of Central America apply apply asylum in other countries.Against this background, the United States first concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras, in order to contain immigration on the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangangutfemale has been transferred at the request of the Argentine judicial system from the former Zoo of Buenos Aires to a sancstation for great apes in the USA. " Sandra, " born in 1986 in the Rostock Zoo, was granted the rights of a " non-human person, " therefore her release was obligator. The animal was brought by direct by to Dallas on Thursday evening - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilogram human apffin is not able to adapt to life in the wild, she will now live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 ororangutans and 31 chimpanzees are housed, among them " Bubbles, " formerly pet of pop star Michael Jackson. However moving before moving, Florida, " Sandra " has has to go through approximately 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
" Sandra " spent several years in Rostock after her birth in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process " SandSand" " rights rights tried by animal animal activists in 2014 has contributed to the fact that the Buenos Aires zoo is converted into an ec@-@ park. A research research research education center is is to be there there to preserve biodiversity by 2023.

Iranian President Hassan Rhani spoke after his return from the UN General Assembly Assembly of an alleged offer by the US to lift sanctions. The United States has promised promised an end of all sanctions in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, Rhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: " Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him to have a meeting. I said, of course, no. "
Rhani describes the event this this: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had ged for a meeting to take place. " And America says that I am lifting the sanctions, " Rouhani. The nature of ppunitive measures should be ended ended were under discussion. " And they clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions. "
However, this advance had not carried out in an acceptable way, Rhani criticised. In view of the current punitive measures and " the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure " no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rhani in New York. The background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated with Russia and China, which is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron had, like Merkel Merkel on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, the hope that Rhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - almost 200 aftershocks
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the day before there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This increases the fear of a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shook the Mara region off Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the metropolis of millions. Now the government wants to set up a commission to prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential buildings collapse down - among other things, made umdown by the many smaller earthquakes, which regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas that were registered in the center as refurefuges have long been built up. Only until the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük quake in August, the Istanbul Chamber of Civil ers had warned that an estimated one one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of Thursday's quwas in the Sea of Marmara in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometers, reported the disaster protection authority Afad. A smaller aftershock a few minutes later caused even greater panic on the streets.
Istanbul Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu announced on Twitter that injuries or damage had not reported reported initially. State state broadstation TRT showed people running out of their houses in panic. Students were taken from the buildings in the district Silivri for security reasons reasons. Some students cried, as can be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly earthquake-ic. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturorder ance which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the quake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, when the earthquake will occur is unclear. In the earthquake on Thursday, it again hit the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have packed so-called go-bags packed with everything they essito stand next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave, the the earth wshobbling. When the next big quake will come is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul of Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments from the Istanbul Disastropaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques collapsed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
After@-@ shock Warning in Istanbul
In social networks networks many report of panic. Buildings wshbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than that on Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the quake is officially to be:: pm (local time). Just a few minutes after the first ake, CNN Turkey reported reported an aftershock of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 had shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was be felt to Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Sea of Marmara west of the millions million metropolis, the disaster protection authority Afad already announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a advance warning. It has become more prob, he said to CNN Türk. " These could be the signs of a larger earthquake, " Ersoy told the transmitter. " Sooner or later the the quearthquake will also come. "
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake also caused great woralso in Istanbul. Moreover, there had been a violent earthquake in Albania a a few days ago - there were 68 injured. The earth had also shaken on Lake Constance this year.

Sttering Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
Actually, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly decided: he will guaranteed not be a third respite of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements are already of perpeteternity for the polarizing Briton. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the UK hovers like a sword of Damocles over the head of blblond. His suspension of parliament to be able to stubcarry carry Brexit bbly until the exit date was annulat the beginning of this week. And a law passed by Parliament obliits Johnson to bring about an extension of bilateral talks talks in the event of failed negotiations with the EU. However Johnson had repeatedly categorically excluded this.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal deal possible
But the pressure does not seem to go noticeably past either. Meanwhile, he made hinations when visiting a hospital that he would support an extension of negotiations in case of of disagreement until the end of October:
You know, we will stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.

Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant close to Castel Sant Sant Angelo in Rome: that seemed too much to two Japanese tourists. Although the bill with 80 euros in tip was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.

A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump may actually face facing imimpeachment process after turturbulent revelations of recent days, the Democrats now want to examine this investigation investigation in the House House as soon as possible - the talk is of weeks until a decision is made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The accusation of the whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation out of concern for for national security and the democracy of the US with his complaint, is monstrous: the president has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country to interveninfluence in the 2020 election. He had wanted to blackmail Ukraine's dependence dency and thus force it to take active against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be eable in the now transcript of the conversation with Zelensky, although it does does not the the full text. But the phone call of July 25 is only one episode of a much larger story, which red beside Trump Trump all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public's point in May 2019, when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly-elected President Zelenskyky, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. " We do not interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation into what we have the right to, " he tells the newspaper. One might think that it is inappropriate, but " nothing about this is illegal. " ani wants wants investigations to be pursued in in Ukraine for which there is hardly basis - - because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and turn prove to be helpful to my government. "
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have become infected with-wing conspiracy fantasies, fixated on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election election: Hillary Clinton had conluired with actors in Ukraine, critics at the time time to construct an occasion for the investigation in the US. However, this allegation could to be taken seriously.
This is about the the investigations that Trump will talk so prominently with with ensensky on the phone in July. The version GiuliGiuliani and the president is: former former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy, Joe Biden, has, as the Ukraine representative of the Obama administration, urged for the dismisof the then Ukrainian Ukrainian Proutor General Wiktor Shookin. In is to stop the investigation he in charge of the gas company, on whose board his son Hunter Biden was worked. Biden senior had extorted financially to cover up the corrupt machinations.
In fact, the process was slightly different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General must go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin in was also accused of deeply corrupt behavior behavior, the US government was far from the only Western partner who pressed for his dismissal. Incidentally, the Obama administration explicitly supported the investigation against the company.

Attention: NEVER charge wirelessly
Practical, but harmful
Inductive technology via the Qi standard is extremely practical, but it should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come on the market, which support wireless charging and are selling very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recrecall a study from the beginning of July.Wireless charging of mobile devices is indeed extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature sets battery to
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerof Warwick, this is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat generation. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. When wireless charging, however, the researchers always measured over over 30 degrees even with perfectly alignment of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature increases even higher. In addition, the watt age of the charging pad increases, which in turn increases the power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Here every individual degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses its capacity, but also does not last last so long. So, lifespan is lower. The researchers therefore recommend that always always charge the smartphone a cable. Since a battery replacement on modern smartphones is always associated associated with high smartphones, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently recently increased the cost of a battery replacement once again - and for all iPhones.
Practically
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these have now already already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable clutter and tedious plug umababout. Since with Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) a global standard prevails, in which exceptionally even Apple participparticippart, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest-jam am photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping secret about whether he is looking for ways to bypass the law recently passed by the Parliament against an unregulated Brexit. On a question on this effect, he only told journalists on Friday that his government would adide to applicable law.
The law provides that the government must apply for a postponof the withdrawal date if no agreement has been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a " capitulation law " that hamcomplicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major suspected on Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick to defer the into force of the law law until period after he left the EU.

Iran apparently to up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on the European treaty tors in the dispute over rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. " Unfortunately, the European states show incompetence ability or of willingness when it comes to concrete actions, " Rouhani on Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. In case that they were not stand by their promises, he prospprospof " further steps " away the agreements reached of the painstakously negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement for the prevention of an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the promise to Tehran to normalize economic rel. The US single single hanaterdly without of the agreement in in order to force Iran with " maximum pressure " to a change of course in the policy to be aggressive Middle East tic. President Donald President Donald administration wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditionand and is now relying on tough sanctions against TTeeran. Iran reacted to this recently with a umption of the uranium enrichment process limited in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now also using the centrifuges installed early September with with uranium or at least prepared them for use. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not willing to bear their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rouhani suspected. However, there will still be further talks, which hopefully would bring a solution.
Rouani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the situation has changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid middle September September Germany Germany France France and the UK followed Monday US the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Initially, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had committed themselves to the attack, which was interpreted as a false commitment by the US. " We have nothing to do with it, " Rouhani affirsized on Wednesday.
" Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of, " Rouhani said. However, the European leaders could not do this in the talks with him during the UN General debate. Instead, they they only argued that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met in recent days with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration must be lifted, Rouhani demanded. He called on the government in Washington to switch to a policy of " dialogue and reason. "

The far-travelled comet was discovered on 30 August by the amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov at the Margo Observatory in the Crimea - with a self-built telescope 65 65 timeters eters in diameter. Follow ups of various observatories confirmed not only that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not come from our solar system.
After 1I /' Oumuamua from 2017, 2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be ted during a flight through our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get up close insights into a foreign solar system before it disappears for-sight. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries reported. " The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at distance distance clearly well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun, " reported Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency NASA in a statement.
According to the analyses the comet et on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that takes it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the ing and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially under under catalog C / / 2019 Q4, was given the name 2I / Borisov, with the first part of the name name ating that it is the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I /' Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been seen on approach. Thus leaves the researchers have many months for investigations. " The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then still be seen with medium sized telescopes until April 2020, " explained Farnocchia. " After that,, it will only be to be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020. "
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I /' Oumuamua, in a first investigation determined the diameter of the celestial object on 2 to 16 kilometers. Photordings of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers from the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. " The spectrum of this object is similar to those of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must to be similar, " reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form form through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of no fewer as two interstellar visitors within just two, according to the IAU suggests that these objects could open up a new path to exploring certain processes in other solar systems. However, how frequent such stip visits are are is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly be intercepted by a planned satellite mission by the European space agency Esa.
The agency wants to station the three-part " Comet Interceptor " (German comet et on a a a position at a million million at 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028. According to Esa Science director Günther Hasinger, it should either urk either for an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor such as 1I /' Oumuamua.
First landing at Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just on time before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic the time has come: At the new ega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital a first first passenger of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for the captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are to be handled at the new airport, which it should be be 72 million by 2025. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion billion project. China's recent presprestige project is also referred to as " starfish " because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new sub@-@ new subway takes orts to the to of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had announced several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which which which has smaller and been under since since 2006 has has been postponponed and and again. Beijing, however, a first passenger plane landed in Beijing after four years.
New supersonic aircraft scheduled to fly in 2030: from London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - that is what the British space agency UK Space Agency. To to make possible possible,, targeted for the 2030s, make at supersonic speed with a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency. " This is the technology that could definitely achieve this, " " agency agency Graham Turnock told the transmitter. " We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced. "
To advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work more more closely with the Australian Agency. flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport so, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until the end of operation in 2003 and and took three to three and a half hours. In 2000, there was an accident during the launch of a Concorde at the Paris airport Charles de Gaulle, during which all 109 occupants were their lives In Last Last year, the American aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to, together with the US space Agency Nasa, develop develop supersonic aircraft aircraft, plane, " X-. acactic also has such developments in the program.
" Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport, " writes Reaction Engines among other things on his homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the earth's atmosphere and thus thus enabled the " next generation truly reusable frame ming equipment. "
Umoil in Washington: Trump wants to down anonymous typers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about the possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to detect possible leaks in the White House.
" I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information, " Trump said on Thursday to employees of the US embassy to the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost " a spy " and such had been with " a little differently " in the past than they is today.
This was regarded as an attempt at intimidation against tipers. The event was not not public. However, several US media distributed audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats responded ougnantly to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives on Tuesday announced preparations for an impeachment proceedings against Trump. Their allegations are based based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence agent, who makes serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. Following great public pressure, the descriptions of the whistleblower had made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received from from government government employees that the US president " using the power of his office " to get another country to interfere in the 2020 US election in his favor.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the end of July in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate investigations that could harm his political rival Joe Biden, involving former deals of den's's's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his son spring Ukrainian justice. Biden in the race for democratic presidential presidential ination for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with a view to the Ukraine phone call: leading government government had had tried to keep the exact wording version of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic wording protocol was made. However, this was removed after the conversation at the instruction of lawyers from the White House from a usually intended database and instead in a particularly protected protected. So far, only a rough protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was to be an employee of the CIA foreign intelligence service.
Trump once again questhe credibility of the source source. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote that the " so-called whistleblower " had spread second-hand information that turned out to to inaccurate. Therefore so there may be no tipsters or spies.
As Trump said in New York about those who had supplied information to the whistleblower, it provoked ougnge. US House of Representatives Chairman Nancy Pelosi, responded worried and complained that Trump's testimony once again undermines the government's integrity.
In the House of Representatives various investigations been ongoing for months in various committees against Trump and his environment. In view of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now driving forward investigations with renewed force in order to launch a possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
" The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation, " the head of the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump ply attacked Schiff, accused him of a misrepresentation of things and again again for the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insults Schiff and had demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US government employees in the security and foreign policy sectors, mostly worked under Democratic but also under Republican presidents, agreed in a statement published on Friday behind the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible impeachment. If the accusations were true, it would be " an unscrupulous abuse abuse of Trump, it said.
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could launch so-called imimpeachment procedure,, the decision on actual impeachment would be in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. Therefore the chances of success such a procedure are therefore low. So, no US president has been dismissed by an impeachment procedure.
VW Works Council: Jobs are " crediously " " "
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023. Of this, 500 million euros are to be already this year.
A key to this is personnel costs. The " Future Pact " negotiated between the companies and works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be be cut at the car manufacturer if it is almost asi proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security is valid until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in the production, which were not actually at disposition, are " cretly " reduced by another way - ie is past the official course. Thus, vacant regular positions would often not not refilled.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility to the reoccupation. Meanwhile, there are a lack in many places, the work density is increasing, the concerns about a gradual bleeding out of vehicle vehicle are are greater. Thus, also increases the fear that the vehicle production could gradually gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW only said about this: " An adjustment of the employment volume will as as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve. "
The VW brand wants to standardistandardize production even more and and manage new projects centrally. This too too, to reduce costs and also accelerate decisions - behind this this is the goal to increase productivity and thus competitiveness competitiveness. Chief of Production Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: " Especially in times of times, from Brexit to the imminent trade war between the USA and China, we are well well advised to make ourselves ourselves res@-@ proof. "
There are already successes on this way: for example, this year, the first per per will for the production time since 2013 compared compared the previous year. Tostmann said told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is due be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be tened by 1.1 hours. VW does not mention the exact figures on production time, according to information from our newspaper, it is the Golf 7 7.
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant fsburg plant is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. The plants in Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, a rule of thumb applies to to VW that 800,000 cars must be there every year that that the plant is satisfacily ably profitable. 2018, however, the utilization zation in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the decreasing demand for diesel and the problems with the conversion to the new WLTP exhaust fuel consumption and exhaust test procedure.
As Chief Production Officer Tostmann announced last year, however, one million cars will roll off the production line in Wolfsburg in Wolfsburg. This is to make it possible bundbundling the golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant will over the Golf production production through the conversion to a location for e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations are now rest on the Golf 8. Despite all the efforts to build e e-mobility, it should remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburger for the time being.

If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will " inform about the industrial dispute measures taken in the LH Group on 14 October, " said Ufo barff member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective barnegotiations with the Ufo for months. This also also to the question of whether the union has has lawfully terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Labour Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to have state that the collective agreements had been terminated. The court dismissed the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examto to file an appeal against it " I consider improunlikely that a second court will see see the matter is completely different, " said Ufo Executive Board Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted an application to the Regional Labour Court Frankfurt to have a review the status of the Ufo as a unionThe company argues that that the union has not set up an authorized executive board for months and is therefore not in a position to fulfill its role as a bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a violent leadership dispute in the trade union, the course of which numerous members of the Executive Board and the advisory board resigned, including the long-standing union leader Nicoley Baublies. Because of the doubts about the doubts about its leadership suspended an already begun ballot on strikes by cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July.

Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of the cities are the causes of the threat, the World Union for the Conservation of Nature Nature in Brussels on Friday. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 which are not found on any other continent. Of these 2626, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already already at the highest level of endangerment and thus before extinction.
The IUCN lists endangered species into six categories: from potentially endangered " to " endangered, " " endendangered, " highly endangered " and " naturally incinct " to " extinct. " It lists lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species as endangered worldwide.
rowan and wild horse chestnut endangered
In Germany, mainly rowans (Sorbus) are threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, told the Deutsche Presse Agency. " Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats. "
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have considered " endangered " since 2017, stage two on the IUCN scale. The greatest threat in addition to a fungus is the Balkan miner moth. It has spread from sou@-@ astern Europe over the entire continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 specimens. Not considered in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Shrubs and mosses also in danger
The IUCN scientists also compilup new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of the molluscs and ses and and almost half all all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural agricultural, and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
" This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet, " said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Europe Office. " We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority. "

US warns federal government of Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trutrust the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great, " Pai told " " Handelsblatt " a view to establishing the new 5G mobile network.
China has a " national security law " that obliges every company " under Chinese jurisdiction " to follow the instructions of the security agencies.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such inquiries, " added the FCC CEO. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The German Government has meanwhile agreed to demand a declaration of trustworthiness " from suppliers.
Berlin would to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports " Handelsblatt blatt " citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology consists not consist consist the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. and software is consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, " PaPai.
It is " very hard to imagine " that a government agency, " no matter where, would be able to check each single individual in in real time to detect security risks, " the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
Owownership relations are opaque. the employee company that which allegedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government, " Pai told " Handelsblatt. "
The USA States had findings, according to which government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to promote the position of the USA.
Chemical factory in northern France on ns: Schools closed
At night, local residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleaning up could now take days.

Illustrious guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: " # ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary-Instagram family, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film. "
With Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she came to photography, the camera was always with her. Thousands of Polaroids made it, some of them are now published for the first time in " The Polaroid Diaries. "
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late nineties. " She wanted real moments, " writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword., of course, one is always one in the center: her husband Paul - as you have never seen him before.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, phephin in bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears shapky Moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they they also led a normal light light headlight light on their farm in southern England or in Scotland. Thus, Mary McCartney said according to the BBC, that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had tfted ered from old potato boxes. And it hasnot always been titiup with the McCartneys.
Like almost any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The shots by Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And you have have to it it at the the right moment, " said Paul McCartney. " If you ap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo. " And Linda would have had the gift of always capture exactly the right moment. " She just knew she had it, " Paul said in the Eshun essay.
There is the light, the composition, the picture detail and the colors, which makes " The Polaroid Diaries " not only an an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but in addition to the anecdotal, is also also great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes landscapes sometimes seem like abstract paints.The perfect addition to the newly reissued Beatles album " Abbey Road, " which was released exactly 50 years ago.

Rental ase suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork has rise from a small startup to a driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is now in crisis. Landlords have to fear for billions of revenue.
The crisis of the office llord WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the largest property estate markets in the world. The company disfounder founder Neumann as boss a few days ago, postponed the planned IPO and began the sale of subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for executives to gain financial freedom for the coming weeks and and months In In,,, the British " Financial Times " reports that WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new leases with immediate effect. Thus, among other other,, the largest tenant of office office is suddenly left the market in New York and London.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and rents it to members in partly small units. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork burns money with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year, the company made a loss of $1.6 billion, on sales of $1.8 billion. This year alone, the rental costs by by renting renting new large areas alone have risen to an estimated $2.5 billion. To to limit the loss, the new management is now to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped the rental of new spaces with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has signed leases with maturities of up to 15 years, generating commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire property markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive property markets in the world, rented almost 300,000 square meters of office office in the the past 24 months WeWorks new contracts contracts alone sured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the space newly came on the market during that time. Without WeWorks Expansion, the office vacancy in the US metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in the " Business Insider. " The situation is similar in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in a prime location.
Also in the British capital, the balance in the real estate market could be significantly without a further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building bought last year by Sparkassen fund provider Deka for almost 100 100 euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have rebuilt their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable profitable, the property owners would probably have to write off some of the hoped-for billions revenues. They have not access the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork, spite despite the long-term leases. Because the lease of the individual locations of WeWork is usually place by each specially founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within limited limits.

New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands upon thousands of people today want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the movement Fridays for movement again plans actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide. The beginning is because of the time difference in New Zealand and Australia before the protests stretch via Europe to North America. There climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How great the global popularity will be this Friday after the record turnout of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good spirits. " Last Friday, over four million people strion for the climate. This Friday we will do doing it again!, " she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
Especially in Germany, the intake was very large last Friday. A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - around 1.4 million - participated in the protests in 575 German cities according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time, according to list of the movement, allies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metcities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15 years old, Thunberg sat in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of their country to a greater commitment to climate protection. This resulted into the Fridays for Future movement within a short period of time. Above Students and students students are involved in the protests, but increasingly increasingly also participating in the climate protests.
Together, they demand more ambition from politicians in the fight against global heating and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming must be contained to to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York almost a two-week transatlantransatlantic cruise on a high sea-yacht racing yacht.

Strilow against cybercriminals - investigators ators out servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have excavfor the first time a large server provider for illegal business on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted as operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle numerous websites through which internationally acting criminals conducted their machinations.
This was announced by the Proutor General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested in a large action on Thursday evening. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world's second largest darkmarketplace for drugs, " Wall Street Market, - which investigators had destroyed in sprspringThe attack on 1.25 million Telekom roters at the end of November 2016 was also according to the prosecorney General's Office via a server in the cyberbunker.
Such a hoster was excavated for the first time in Germany, it was said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.

New Global Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people today want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metmetropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such Jüchen chen North Rhine Rhine-ppia or Westerland on Sylt lt Climate climate activist Greta Thunberg wants take part in a major rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests ǀ Who are Thunberg's backers?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoking factories that warm the climate. All it all the astonishing that a 16-year-old girl holds the mirror in her face of the power man of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helphelpfulness or pclever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterat or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and makes young people to rise for a better climate-friendly world. Historically it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages manages to win an collection of children and adolescents. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne had felt chosen chosen to stand up for a fairer world. At that time, he was also able to win a crowd of young people for himself and aded them to cross the sea in order to get into the Promised Land, similar to Greta Thunberg recently set out on the trip to America with a sailboat.
But is there a dark side in this regard? Why does it need a share called " We don't have time " to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which sold extensively, thanks to the daughter standing in the spotlight. Also time-and tried followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip by by boat was probably too too too thick for some successors. This is not unfounded, because the action was very well into its in the the worldwide and there is a lot money flowing thanks to the imposing action.
Here the the are divide: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic, if certain circles of people work together together with stock brokers during the world rescue campaign? No matter which position is ultimately ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point point of view is and more important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives on on different opinions and discussions. Therefore it can well make sense cricritically seemingly pious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
An alien comet is currently trasecting our solar system.
The astronomers' suspjecture have been confirmed: A foreign comet is currently secsing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time the researchers only suspected it, but now they are certainty: A comet from another star is crossing our solar system at the moment. It was baptinamed after its explorer 2I / Borisov and is currently employying astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in the Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov in the Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-made telescope and further subsequent observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet, does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind, which was sighted during flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers now is to gain insights into a foreign solar system from close. Apparently, the comet is similar to those of our own system, as the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands reports. According to the International Astronomical Astronomical Union (IAC, the comet is clearly interstellar origin and currently moves on a so-called hyperbelorbit, which leads it out of our system.
Comet was been spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it is that,, astronomers can observe him in detail. Because unlike its predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in its approach, which means that it can be examined from Earth for many months. " The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be be seen with medium sized telescopes by April 2020, " explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa. " After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020. "
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 " Oumuamua. "
First findings about comet 2I / Borisov araken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star star similar to to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form formed similar processes processes in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two of such objects have already been discovered within two years may possibly allow a new way of researching certain processes in other solar systems.
Time and again ids asteroids occupy the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid raced past Earth and came dangerously close to it.

An actor and Youtuber attames Egypt's ruler: for the time being, Mohamed Ali preto stay abroad.
The two men who have influence on whether blood flows flows on the streets of Egypt, have spent both spent week last week. One of the two hoverated again at at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi came back from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who deposed the Muslim Brotherhood Mohamed Morsi, the first freely-elected of of the the, in 2013, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's actions against against political Islam and not lost a syllable about the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people, because they dared against against president president He He " " no " " " " reason worry " " at at the airport into microphmicrophones state television. " The Egyptians will not be misled. "
To lead mis- - that according to the opinion of the other man, who currently determines the events on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course remained abroad, where he evades the grip of the security forces, who would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian ground. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only only a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafes, the living rooms and tea rooms of the the country: With his YouTube channel " Mohamed eds Sects, " Ali calls on his comptrymen to rise up against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president indulges in luxury and lets magnificent magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, accuses him of corruption and enrichment. Because he has done business in his second job as a contractor for his second with with these these gentlemen, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding cliclick numbers show.
After thousands had demonstrated for the time since Sisi's grip for power since Sisi's grip against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, including prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, been arrested, Ali called for a " million march " for this this Friday. That that so many people would really dout to the streets was unlikely. But there there to scal smaller protests, for example, in Giza near Cairo and in the town of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests, whose participants accaccused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded for his departure. During these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos could initially first initially could not independently verified from security circles that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators tore apart banners with the portrait of the president last week, massive police presence presence was reported on Friday. Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and on the terial roads. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed for " maintenance work, " most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And in Rabaa Square, where supporters supporters of the oversted Muslim BroBrother Morsi entrenched themselves in 2013, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, a another measure should prevent disdisof gathering: SFuture to hold a major rally for the president.
Mohamed Ali caused these precautions to change his tactics: " Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square, " Ali said to his video camera in Barcelona. " Let's not cde with police.. " this should not be understood as a backtreat: " All of Egypt is Tahrir Square. "

In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: they were forged.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports had been revealed. Thereuthe Wada had banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this this,, Russian athletes were not completely banished from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee, after individual individual at the 2016 Summer 2016 Summer Games in Rio, about 270 athletes from the country compete under a neutral flag, at the Winter Games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were the start.

We should check whether the task force has received the right data, " said David Howman in an interview with the " Frankfurter Allgemeine Allgemeine " " on Friday. " We found numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada from a whistleblower and and those which received received from the Russians.. " Many positive findings were missing, mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organization to keep the spell of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes compete under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, Wada had already put manipulations in the room and on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening to renewed ban of the Rusada and in the worst case the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
