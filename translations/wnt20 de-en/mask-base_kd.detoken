Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. The prefecture of Normandy announced on Friday. The fire broke out in the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 fire engines.
Stop the fire
Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. Additives for lubricants are produced in the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine. The factory is part of the Lubrizoole company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work at the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when the gas methanthiol escaped through a leak in 2013 and the surrounding area elled much of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewater system after an industrial accident.

Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday 27 September 2019
Six machine guns of type MG3 have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition. These include three machine guns. In most cases, the whereabouts are unclear. The opposition speaks of a " frightening " extent.
Weapons and ammunition keep disappearing in the Bundeswehr - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39, 39 weapon parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is the result of a list of the Federal Ministry of Defence classified as classified, about which the editorial network Germany reports.

In addition, 30 weapon guns for machine guns of type MG3 are missing.
The extent of weapons and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr is " frightening, " said the left-wing Bundestag Martina Renner. This is all the more true since hardly anything was found again in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a " poor balance. " Renner criticized that the list does not recognizable whether there is also the the the the unition unition that was found in connection with the investigations against the the federal officer who officer under suspected Franco A.. " And that, although a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted for the possession of this ammunition, " said Renner.
Stena Impero oil tanker left Iranian port
More than two months after its arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas today, Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker started to move and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters. It was from the shipping company that they wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
The " Stena Impero " had been raised on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Seestraße of Hormuz on charges of having violated security regulations. However, it was assumed that Iran reacted to the controversial, temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar belonging to Great Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil export is shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have exacerbated immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping was drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There were several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to people's courage in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel paid tribute to the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU parliamentary group on the forthcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. Among other things, the chancellor recalled the occupation of the Stasi's headquarters. " The state security was taken away of horror, " she said.
Musk aims for delivery record
Tesla's quarter may hold a record. Despite the delivery boom, there were recent losses at the electric car company.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers. " We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, " Musk wrote in an email address to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek. "
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could record 110000 orders, Musk's circulsletters continued. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customers. Tesla had to find as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-figure figures are required in the current and next quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Puzzles solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found this out with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Here, progress has also been made on the question of why children defend themselves so violently against tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also become out why the approaching of a tickling hand triggers laughter even before the touch. This is due to a deep layer in the cerebrum, which already triggers laughter at the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with " laughter " in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans. This " laughter " is conveyed by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-touching
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - that is, people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out during the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the respective area of the cerebral cork are suppressed during a self-touch. This is also the case when living beings clean themselves. During the foreign contact and the tickling by the scientists, but the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh had been intensified.
But if the self-touch and the touch by others pass at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat could not distinguish between self-touch and the touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-touch activated a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Thus, they sometimes broke off this initiation in the experiment prematurely, showed escape behavior or rigiof terror. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioural reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Catastrophe averted: Great fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, was extinguished, as the prefecture of Normandy told the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire broke out on the night to Thursday.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances should have leaked out. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with about 200 fire engines.
Schools and kindergartens have been closed
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, and schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The factory is part of the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements. Around 400 people work in the plant.
The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when the gas methanthiol escaped through a leak in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled far of rotten eggs. In 2015, after an operational accident, around 2000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
Brexit: Johnson criticised by sister
The prime minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session in parliament after the lifting of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The prime minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU on 31 October without an agreement if Brussels does not engage with his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
About Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the prime minister said: " The best way to honour Jo Cox's memory and reunite this country would be to leave the EU. " Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Memorial to Oslo and Utöya unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims is unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument " Jernrosene " (English: The Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron replicas of roses. They commemorate the roses that were laid by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
The project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be revealed at the same location - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit, among others, are expected at the opening.
On 22 July 2011, Anders Behring Breivik had detonated from a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and then shot down dozens of participants in a camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party on the island of Utöya. A total of 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tanker
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one problem problem. The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " detained in Iran was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero, " which has been detained in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After being release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The " Stena Impero " has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, explained shipping company Erik Hånell. Around noon the ship has left the Iranian waters. " It's nice that it's over, " he told the Swedish TV station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London described the fixing of the ship as illegal. " This is part of a model of attempts to affect the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law, " said a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had established the tanker on 19 July on charges of violating regulations on the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well in the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in view of the difficult and exhausting situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them retogether with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar behind the fixing of the " Stena Impero ": at the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was said to have been intended for Syria. According to the authorities, the delivery was contrary to EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of " piracy " and threatened with consequences. In mid-August the " Adrian Darya-1 " was finally released. London vehemently rejected the assumptions that it was a barter to free the " Stena Impero. "
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world's oil export is shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US left the international nuclear agreement on its own, which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb, and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has pressured Tehran leadership with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a stricter agreement, which has been extended to other areas.
Due to the " Stena Impero " dispute and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the " Coalition of Hope " initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protective powers, wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to become a war war profiteer. " Given the punitive tariffs imposed imposed on Chinese manufacturers by America's President, Donald Trump, foreign producers in the People Republic are compelled to redepate. Financial leaders of Asian companies that are considering moving their production from China to another country cite India as one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. However, this has not only to do with the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers and an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems created like to play a more significant role in the globally widely-fied production chain.
But now India itself has fallen into Trump's focus. Disjoratively called the " Kingdom of Tariffs " by the White House wardle, " America dedeprived the emerging of its trade benefits for 2000 products in early June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, however, the friction with India is a sideline. Moreover, America considers the world's largest democracy through the glasses of security policy. Delhi and Washington share concern about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salvo of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just started a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh to safety.
The problem, however, lies in a different place: the empirically corroborated thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult time in the socialist Republic of India. Even under Modi. His zeal for reform mainly aims at the bureaucratic madness, which suffocated in the multi-ethnic state for too long any entrepreneurial spirit. Companies now receive faster building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more complex insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions to liquidate apparently dead companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From economic optics, much has changed for the better in India in the first five Modi years. However, this does not apply in trade policy. Inspired by the protection of protecting uncompetitive companies from foreign providers, the national conservative government even established new barriers.
In the West, Modi is the to the us of the energetic reformer, who is renews his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well which vocabulary of Western managers like. In essence, however, the " India First " lawyer never moved away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the isolation of their industries are among the regular voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this my@-@ ghted policy.
Burial of Jacques Chirac Monday in Paris

Carn the competitors to the finish: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The top of the world had long been at the finish line when heartwarming scenes took place in the cooled down Khalifa International Stadium. In the first heat of men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba, began to sway dangerously. He could barely keep himself on his legs a good 300 meters before the finish, ran in an unhealthy posture, when Braima SSar ar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea Bissau suddenly hugged him him and draghim to the finish for supporting the last half half-stage. At both, However, the forces were still enough to stop the running wristwatch after the finish run. As if the scene would not have been curious enough.
" I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same, " said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he caught the attention of the assembled journalists completely unexpectedly. He was shly ly ly first first, did not want to talk at all about his heroic deed. After all, he wanted to set his personal best and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow suffererer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which had been invited by the World Federation for the World Cup. Under normal circumstances, he should not have even started. " Therefore, I am proud to run here for my country, " he said.
He did that emphatically on the evening - and much more intensively than he would have thought. Because this heroic deed will remain in memory. Especially since Dabo even gave his competitors Busby the lead at the finish and voluntarily took over the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, it had nothing of anything, because Busby, who only reached the finish with a lot of help, was disqualified by the World Light Athletics Federation at the very end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had competed to set a personal best at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this succeeded with 18: 10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: " I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes. " However, only in training, best times do not count.
Millions of mash: Egyptians prepare for wild day of protest
In Egypt, the security measures were stepped up in the run-up to possible protests critical of the government. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations were closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
Already in recent days the police had stepped up their road checks and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians partly on news and photos in connection with the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, there were protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whom critic was accused of corruption and mismanagement. There had not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who was exile in Spain and who set up the demonstrations with video messages in motion on Facebook, has called for a " million-dollar march " in central places in the country today. Ali calls for a " people's revolution. " For most young Egyptitians though, the man is not a " gter, because he posted millions as a subcontractor for the army, but his messages are coming.
According to two observer groups, the number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. At first, these figures could not be confirmed. The government also did not confirm and comment on the figures.
Arbitary arrests
Many people were " arbitrarily arrested, " " just because they were in the wrong place' at the wrong time', " HRW said, citing detainees. According to their lawyers, the allegations against the detainees range from " dissemination of false information " to membership in a " terrorist association. " In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces arbitrarily interviewed and searched pas@-@ by in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW information.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: mail order companies should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although companies could not be exempted from the VAT on donations in kind, the ministry explained on a question of the Green parliamentary group about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, the traders could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or little VAT.
Scientists of the University of Bamberg had determined that the German citizens return every sixth package when placing orders on the Internet. About four percent of the goods - approx. 20 million products - ended up in the garbage. To donate them would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate donations in kind like a turnover, on which then VAT then then urred.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies cannot evaluate saleable products accordingly and donate them to non-profit organisations free of charge. Companies must be able to rely on not being penalised for donations. This applies not only to online trade, but also to other shops from the fashion store to the hardware store.
Banksy auction art: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of street art star Banksy, " Devolved Parliament, " will soon be auctioned off.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines " the regression of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the attitude shaped by animals and tribes. " From Saturday, the painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital, until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in the south-west of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had exhibited the painting again - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work, formerly called " Question Time, " was renamed the " Devolved Parliament. "
The image could change hands for a million-dollar amount.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had in a hard exchange of blows with the opposition at the first meeting of the House of Commons on Wednesday, following the lifting of a forced break imposed by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit, which had already been postponed twice, on 31 October without an agreement with the EU if necessary.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture depicting a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. Thousands of truck drivers and other visitors enter the United Kingdom every day.
Brexit debate is like a walk in the park
According to his top adviser, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fierce verbal attacks on his opponents of Brexit in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a " walk in the park, " Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book launch. " We enjoy that. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win. "
Johnson had severely attacked Brexit's opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them, among other things, of " betraying " the people. He dismissed accusations that he could put MPs in danger because they could become the target of death threats as " humbug. "
Cummings said that the only way to calm down would be if MEPs finally respected the British's decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were upset about the fact that Britain had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for their restraint on Friday. " We should talk to each other with respect, " a statement said. " And we should also listen. "
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN interference in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, in his first appearance before the UN General Assembly, has once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN general debate in New York. " If this goes badly, one hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst. " The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. " You should have prevented this. "
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate a part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn the Indian Kashmir region of autonomy status and thus suddenly increased tensions in relations with Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the fall of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is reacting against the current protests in Egypt with a hard hand. It uses live ammunition to shoot at the population, and over 2000 arrested people join the 60,000 political prisoners already held there in the prisons. Protesting in Egypt has never been harmless in Egypt. However, since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything possible to avoid a scenario similar to the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one's own government drove millions onto the streets. And this is a problem that even the el-Sisi regime does not get a grip on, no matter how hard it is against adversaries. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who you are funding: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, food and much more. That was already the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regime, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It is becomes critical when large parts of the population have difficulties to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER boss: No more " showstoppers " for capital airport
For two months, it was checked whether the complicated system braid works in interaction during BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed audit, but also said that there were still shortcomings to be completed in the terminal. " We have a lot of detailed topics, but we don't have a real showstopper. " He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve is no longer likely to be too large. The notification of notification is now to be submitted to the building authority in the course of the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables can still be remedied; the Tüv wants to examine them by February. " In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, we must continue to work vely on the processing of the defects, " it said in a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all dowels on which the cable routes hang. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not work satisfactorily. Three years ago, the problems had already led the project into another crisis. This time, it is about smoke aprons, which shut down in a fire like a screen so that the smoke does not spread. They go down too far. Therefore, 36 engines must be replaced. Then, there will be new experiments with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. Originally it was scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Since the start of construction in 2006, costs have increased from two billion euros to an expected to be around 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. That is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October is scheduled, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial Director Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on a firm feet.
Chemnitz: Vending machines for drugs - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and chased several vending machines in the city area of Chemnitz into the air! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
In the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply.
After two detonations, the police seized a 33-year-old German at the end of May on the Bu � rgerstraße and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: " In the course of the investigation into the procuration of explosive explosions in crime unit with a particularly serious case of theft, which were caused by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion was against the 33-yes. "
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now admitted a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: " With the booty he has apparently financed his beta exercise legliness. " Alone had blown up the bomber four times between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019 parking ticket machines on the Bu � rgerstraße.
The total damage incurred amounted to at least 60 000 euros!
The vending machine bomber is now in custody. The police investigations against him continue.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further blasions in Chemnitz and adjacent counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is turning up its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA " takes over the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna, " confirmed a press officer of Austrian Airlines to APA on Friday. Previously, " AviationNetOnline " had reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will thus be disfacto dissolved. Of the seven Eurowings aircraft currently, four will remain in Vienna. From January 2020, the AUA will take over in the " Wetlease, " including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which are to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, explained the speaker. The flight times are to be adjusted to connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other, to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a " production company " for the Group nurse AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings device. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants come from EuEurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but like the AUA in Terminal 3.
A price war broke out at Vienna Airport after the Niki bankruptcy. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced only on Thursday that the fleet would increase in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. For this, the Irish low-cost airline will sending four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called " Wetlease, " which the union criticized as a bypass to the collective agreement.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's announcement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, to AUA CEO Andreas Otto on Friday: " We remain number one at the site in five, six or ten years. "

Study on heart disease causes
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg-based researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genetic material of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to track down the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the High Mountain Hospital Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital of Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the main controllable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genome of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Cardiovascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - are known, it was said by the clinic. Every year, about 200 were added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options, such as for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be used in the study of other common diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Cardiovascular Centre. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there was a firm will to use the data to investigate other diseases. So far, the foundation's clinic in Davos has mainly primarily with allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovasascular Precision Medicine was to be established on the medical incampus and a professorship for bioinformatics would be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated at the open heart in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The organic samples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the " Hamburg City Health Study. " According to the hospital ic, this is largest local local health study in the world with 45,000 test persons. In the case of genetic coding, strict attention paid to the protection of the anonymised data data, the scientists insured. It is about one petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to the UKE, the genetic material of a human being can be deciphered today within 24 hours. The pure material costs are 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to begin on 1 October and all 9,000 samples will be analysed by the end of 2020. Initial results are expected in the following year.
Nigerian police released hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to indications from residents, security forces searched the school in the Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of them were underors, as police spokesman Yakubu told Sabo. " The victims were mistreated. some of them said they were raped by their teachers, " Sabo said.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught in the Koran and " improved. " In fact, the protégés were held by their teachers under " the most degrading and inhumane conditions, " Sabo said About a hundred students, including children at the age of nine, were chained in a small room.
According to information, the Koran school had existed for about ten years. Residents had reminded the authorities' authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. Parents were shocked to be informed about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
There are many private Koran schools in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighboring state of Niger in the last ten months.
Chaained and tortured: Nigeria's police free 400 children from school
Policemen have freed nearly 400 students from horrible conditions in a school in northern Nigeria. " Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that ating torture, " said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after a hint in an Islamic school. The conditions there were " inhuman. " The officers arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were kept like slaves at their school and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television pictures showed emaciated and injured students in a clearly poor health.
World Football Election: Further accusations according to Messis and Klopp's freestyle
Soccer " Signature not valid "
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, Fifa awards the best player, best player and the best coach of the year. It is the sixth honor and thus a record for Lionel Messi.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he never voted in the world football election, accusations come to Fifa from other countries. Egypt was not counted - with a curious reason.
Much of the Fifa has proved to be disreputable in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt functions.However, the FIFA FIFA world football player election has not been suspected of being unclean - if one disaside from the fact that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote more for sympathy than for objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible vote overview.
FIFA apologizes to the fact that " the signatures on the electoral forms were given in capital letters and therefore not valid. " The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan also surprised
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese federation states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally scored: with Lionel Messi on first place, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was received in the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also raised accusations: " Did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All information on my vote is wrong, thank you, " he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
The message came from the association on the now: True, but of course was no intention. The completed election documents had been provided " erroneously " with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it said in a message of the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas actually chosen. " We assume the responsibility for the administrative error, " it said in the message. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, " quite as it is in the official list of FIFA. "
The other cases are now examined by Fifa in an investigation, but emphasizes that the electoral process was supervised supervised by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world footballer election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: Ranking Republicans in favour of official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly advocfor an official investigation against the US president and party friend Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, " said the Republican Vermont Governor Phil Scott. " Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that will be established. " He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment process can lead to the deposition of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a telephone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been observing Biden " for years. "
The Republicans have so far refrained from criticising Trump for the whistleblower affair, and few have shown uneasy about it. Scott's remarks are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. Virginia's moderate governor had already turned against Trump's policies several times, such as the easing of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, called supported the investigation. " It's a deeply disturbing situation, " Baker said. " The right course of action and responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it. "
Scott and Baker, as governor of the US states, have no say say in the case against Trump, which is being decided in Congress. Therefore, their statements are symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first Republican senators have also been critical of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the Second Chamber of Representatives, said that the case is " extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing. " US media also report that there are internal initial cracks among the Republicans.
The affair could culminate in the opening of impeachment proceedings against Trump, and the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on actual impeachment would fall in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects of such a a success are slim. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment process.
Were torturers on board from Racketes " Sea Watch "?
Three men were arrested in Sicily and allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had illegally visited the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship " Sea Watch 3 " and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also from Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations against Rackete are being voicdly. Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have arrived in Italy with the " Sea-Watch 3. " The suspects were caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. " We cannot rule this out, but we have no reliable information ourselves, " said " Sea Watch " spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects had raped, tortured and even murdered in the North African country. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). " The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence, " it said at the time.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who gets to the ships. " We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports, " said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why the people flee from Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators are also on the ships. " It is therefore very important that this is investigated. "
Italy's right-wing former Minister of the Interior, Matteo Salvini, immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
Musk strives for delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers.
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, " Musk wrote to Tesla employees in an e-mail published by the industry blog " Electrek. "
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could record 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's circular. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customers. To do this, Tesla had to find as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased to that extent in almost four months. Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This will require six-digit figures in the current and next quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Finally despite the boom, there were losses.
US budget dispute: Once again only a bridge financing
The new fiscal year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on transitional financing by 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in the spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again facing no spending plans before the new fiscal year beginning on October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and approved transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21. Without such such a decision, a shutdown would have taken place at midnight on Monday, a closure of the federal administration. President Trump must still put the decision into force.
Shutdown
For the time being, the federal administration is now being financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019, which ends on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 expenditure laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and the authorities. Therefore, for the time being, the federal administration cannot benefit from the extended expenditure framework for the new financial year from 1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion.
The Democrats have finalized ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the spending laws reflect Democratic priorities that have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has more or less willing ten of the twelve spending plans that are hardly capable of a majority.
The ghosts differ primarily on the topic of resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the Wall, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats are disturbed by the Wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the construction of the Wall, the ghosts divorce
It is currently unclear how the parties want to get closer on this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November. Also, a shutdown is not ruled out of that time.
Against the background of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree in time on the twelve spending laws, and the associated danger of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Submission p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the financing of the federal administration would automatically continue at the previous year's level, stop the travel activities of parliamentarians and retain their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows for artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination will also be open to live living women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill according to which all women can claim in vitro insemination. Thus, the demand for anonymous sperm donations is likely to increase significantly.
The bill still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right had warned that in the future numerous " children without a father " could grow up. Also, the French Bishops' Conference is against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an " opportunity " for society. It maps the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the costs for artificial insemination for all women are to be borne by social security.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband
By a narrow majority, the National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected an amendment to give widows access to the sperm of their dead for artificial insemination. Artificial insemination " post mortem " is permitted in Belgium, Spain and Great Britain. In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women accused in vain ain ain of issuing the sperm of a deceased. Opponents of the advance in Paris argued that such a faotten child then had a " particularly severe fate. "
Numerous MPs of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition spoke in favour of artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They emphasized that a widow would be imposed a " double mourning, " if the death of her husband also her desire to have children remained unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can in future be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
Until far, artificial insemination has only allowed heterosexual couples in France who cannot produce children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain banned.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation payment for the climate: calls for flight delivery for universities are getting louder
There is a lot of flown at the universities. That's why the country wants to pay a climate levy there in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also coming under pressure internally.
Universities should also limit flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The postponed discussion about a climate levy on flights operated by universities and colleges before the summer break is gaining momentum again. After the State Rectors' Conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral students from six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university call for a compensation of service flights. This is as a first step " urgently necessary, " at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidable idability of flights, it says in their statement. The cabinet decision originally planned in decision in July July is still on ice, because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the secret service FSB, the detainees fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were already arrested. when there was an exchange of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no casualties, it was said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. Thus, the North Korean fishermen were on their way in Russian territorial waters. There, the Russian Coast Guard is patrols to protect their marine-biological resources.
30,000 squid confiscated
During the new checks, 30,000 squid were discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, according to three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nakhoka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even according to complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern Region of Primorsky sky, Georgi Martynov, recently complained of the high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also take small creatures out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed.
Only 18,000 in the future: USA to lower asylum ceiling
The " most generous nation in history ": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police in the White House.
The richest country in the world is closing itself off to those seeking protection: As the State Department confirms in Washington, the upper limit for the legal immigration of refugees will be further lowered. In the future, threatened believers and Iraqis are to receive asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the US State Department explained. In the almost past marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
In recent years, President Donald Trump's administration has drastically lowered the willingness to receive for-seekers from around the world. Under Barack Obama's previous government, there were far higher reception boundaries.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US Refugee Program in 1980. Nevertheless, the State Department described the US as " the most comptiful and generous nation in history, " a formulation strongly reminiscent of the incumbent US President's language.
A " responsible treatment " of refugees is aimed at ensuring that the refugees can return to their home countries to help with reconstruction there, Trump said. For his hard course in migration policy, he receives a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal off. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure over the Selensky affair and a possibly impending impeachment procedure.
According to statements from the Foreign Office, the US government wants to concentrate on the admission of two refugee groups in the future: people who are being persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus been in danger, as to the statement of the State Department shows. On the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken in from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The US wants people from this " northern triangle " of Central America in particular to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has first concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to contain immigration on the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
At the request of the Argentine judiciary, a female angutan has been transferred from the former zoo in Buenos Aires to a reception tuary for apes in the USA. " Sandra, " who was born at Rostock Zoo in 1986, was granted the rights of a " non-human person, " so her release was mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening - but not as a passenger, but in the hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram Menschenäffin is unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, she is to live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already housed 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them " Bubbles, " formerly pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before the into Florida, however, " SandSandra " has to endure a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, " Sandra " spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of " Sandras " fundamental rights, which was initiated by animal rights activists in 2014, has contributed to the transformation of the Buenos Aires zoo into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and educational facility for the preservation of biodiversity is to be established there.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
Extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold managed a new hussar ride on the almost 3000-metre-high Große Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double ground or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550-metre-high north face of the Great Pinnacle in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. He thus undercut the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a free solo speed holder on four of the six most important European north faces.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sporting goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profits. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars (just under 1.3 billion euros) in the past quarter. That is 25 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. The reason for this is the new marketing strategy " Nike Direct, " with which the Adidas competitor online addresses its customers directly.
Sales rose to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period until the end of August. Nike sales increased the sharply in China with an increase of 22 percent. Thus, the Group from Beaverton in the US state of Oregon also benefited in the People's Republic from its approach to focus directly at consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
CFO Andy Campion announced that Nike will further advance the " digital transformation " of the sporting goods manufacturer with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased with the quarterly figures - the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about soccer pro Juan Jesus of AS Rom, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. Brazil-born defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. " @ officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. # NoToRacism. Proud of being who I am, " wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing for AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted late Thursday. He had reported the account of the fan on Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporters are never allowed to visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. " We cannot have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums, " Fifa President Gianni Infantino said at the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist chants in the first league match between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florenz on previous Sunday.
But there had also been recent discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rioting fans of record champions Juventus Turin. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. Accordingly bbitions of four to seven years apply to the rest.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups in the vicinity of Juventus. The twelve are accused, among other things, severe extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had set the investigation in motion with an complaint last year.
According to Italian media reports, the Ultra leaders are said to be behind the black trade in tickets. They have " militarily controlled " the ticket trade for the fan curve and are said to have blackmailed Juventus employees in order to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole years are given with handchy names. If you take a closer look, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective attitude to life of young people?
" The crabs are coming! " With this call, crab fishing at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun officially started on September 21st, heralding the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones.

Iran-US Conflict: Ruhani speaks of end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged offer by the US to lift sanctions. The United States had promised an end to all sanctions in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: " Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on it so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no. "
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and urged a meeting to take place. " And America says I am lifting the sanctions, " added Ruhani. The kind of punitive measures that should be stopped have been debated. " And they have clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions. "
However, this advance had not taken place in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticised. In view of the punitive measures in force and " the poisoned atmosphere of the maximum pressure, " no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York, backed to the Europeans' hope to save the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China, which is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. Like Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This increases the concern of a disaster.
Fourteen schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. On Thursday, the earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmararegion off Istanbul and triggered panic in the metropolis of millions. Now, the government wants to use a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - among other things, worn over by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas, which were registered as as refuge places in the center, have long been built. It was only until the 20th anniversary of Gölcük quake in August that the Chamber of Civil Engineering of Istanbul warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of Thursday's quake was located in the Sea of Marmara in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometres, as announced by the civil protection authority Afad. A few minutes later, a smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu reported on Twitter that no injured or damage had been reported at first. TRT state broadcaster showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some students cried, as shown in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly earthquake prone. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the 1999 quake near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 to 7.4 threaten. However, it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. During the earthquake on Thursday it hit the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private individuals have finished so-called go-bags with everything they need to stand next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wobbles. When the next big quake will come, is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques collapsed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning shocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings wigshbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than that on Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned of aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official data, the time of the quake is given as 13: 59 (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was an aftershock, which was given with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday, an earthquake with a magnitude 4.6 had shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt until Istanbul. Also, its epicenter had been located in the Sea of Marmara west of the metropolis of millions, the civil protection authority Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan, too, was hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will discharge at some point - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now an advance warning. It has become more likely, he told CNN Türk. " These could be the signs of a major earthquake, " says Ersoy to the transmitter. " Sooner or later the big quake will come. "
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the earthquake also caused great worries in Istanbul. In Albania, there had also been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also at Lake Constance, the earth had shaken this year.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents are creating a new fuel in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment procedure, the US Democrats are encouraged: the complaint about Trump by an anononymous whistleblower and his controversial telephone call with the Ukrainian president provides important evidence for investigations against the president. Trump once again sees himself as a victim of a " witch hunt. " In addition, he doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in the toilet - Flieger redirected
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight was diverted by United Airlines. The toilet door had been blocked from Washington to San Francisco during flight 1554, the airline said, according to US media.
During an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin. She had been locked up in it for about an hour, US media wrote, citing to other passengers. Passengers had to change the planes to continue to San Francisco.
In a video distributed on the Internet, which according to the US media is said to be from flight 1554, you can see how several people are trying to free the woman. " We are working at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We will get you out soon, Okay?, " says man man in it. The airline apologized to all passengers. At first, it was open whether the woman would receive compensation.
The cockroach inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the chaos of Brexit? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story " The Metamorphosis, " the British British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in Great Britain.
The novel " The Cockroach " (" The Cockroach ") will be published in German on 27 November, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named " Jim Sams, " who was ignored or hated in his earlier life, but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into practice and is wildly determined to let nothing and no one stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: " When parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers shamelessly lie like the Soviet leaders once did, when Brexiteers in high positions almost implfor the catastrophe of a high deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write. " Von McEwan had only appeared in the spring of the novel " Machines like me " about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself " transformed into a tremendous vermin, " is gradually excluded from family and society and finally perishes. " Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands by his head, " it said by Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria & apos; s rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary will receive whisper brakes in order to reduce noise pollution from freight trains. In addition, sections of the rail connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron will be modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authority, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot " Connecting Europe Facility. "
Thomas Cook: All trips until October 31st cancelled
One day after his insolvency application, the German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all trips up to and including 31 October 2019. Travel " could not be started for reasons of insolvency law, " the company announced on Thursday evening.
This would also affected bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid for or paid in full. As it is about travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left. In the coordination with the insolvency insurance the further procedure is examined, it was said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the bankruptcy of the British parent company and had filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The company, which includes, among others, Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money back to hotels
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad that currently still host Thomas Cook holidaymakers will receive money from the Zurich Insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked to make extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman of the German Press Agency said. " This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travelers are not immediately asked or otherwise coercto individually pay hotel bills from these hotels, " spokesperson Bernd Engelien continued.
The insurance thus reacted to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own statements, had been forced to pay for their local accommodation themselves. Accordingly, some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had sharply criticised this.
How many hotels are affected will be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance spokesman. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers from Germany were still on the road. Zurich Germany has secured the holiday and return journey of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by the Zurich Insurance only help the travelers who are currently still on the road. It looks bad for Thomas Cook customers who still want to go on holiday. Late on Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips up to including 31 October would be cancelled. This also applies to such bookings that have already been paid.
As it stands about travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it was said. Basically, the insurance company Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry Destroys Explosive Mine in Angola
Prince Harry has been continuing the commitment of Lady Diana for a long time. In Africa he is now following following in the footsteps of his mother.
Dressed in a blue splinter protection vest, the British Prince Harry has detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he created the ignition circuit in front of TV cameras on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded in the savanna landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same explosive master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to travel the path she was taking. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a spacious minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She, too, had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
End of Brexit Negotiations: The Risk of a No Deal Remains Acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made himself clear: with him, there is guaranteed to be a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations not. But what statements are already lasting lasting with the polarizing Briton. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain hovers like a sword of Damocles over the Blondopf. His suspension of the parliament in order to be able to carry out his Brexit course until the withdrawal date was was annulled earlier in this week. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to effect an extension of the failed bilateral talks in the event of failed negotiations with the EU until 31 October. However, Johnson had categorategorically excluded this.
Boris Johnson considers deal still possible
But the pressure does not seem to be noticeably missing Johnson either. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he made hints that in the event of a non-agreement, he supported an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we will abide by the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that it works.
And time is gradually running away from the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have about six weeks to prevent Great Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. However, even the recent talks have again not achieved a breakthrough. An agreement until the end of currently seems rather difficult to imagine it. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a renewed postponement of the withdrawal date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Minister. It fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no deal.
US agency: e-cigarette deaths
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the USA has risen to twelve. Moreover, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, the US health authority CDC. According to a study in the " New England Journal of Medicine, " there were already more than 900 people affected, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage is known so far. Complaints seem to be limited to users in the USA.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Millions of videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared into online networks, in which the contractor and actor who lives in Spain calls for a " people's revolution. " For this Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass rallies with one million participants in central places in the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence could already be observed. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in recent days, the police had stepped up their road checks and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians partly for news and photos in connection with the protests.
On 20 September, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, hundreds of participants had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2000 people were arrested since last week. Many of them were arbitrarily arrested - just because they were " in the the wrong place at the wrong time, " HRW said on the appeal of lawyers.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after overthrowing the democratically elected Islamist president Mohamed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially condemned in recent years.
" Ocean Change ": Arved Fox of Greenland Expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival at the Port of Hamburg he was welcomed among others by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who brought the climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the race yacht " Malizia. "
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship " Dagmar Aaen " on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement was a blessing, said the polar researorer. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak up. It had been known for decades that the earth was warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
" What happens at sea often takes place in secret, " " Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the litter of the oceans. During the expedition, among other things, Greenlandic glacier ice was measured with a drone and fished for microplastics with nets, it was said.
For his " Fight for sustainable and respectful use of the world's eans, " the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the " Seadevcon Maritime Award " as part of the Hamburg Climate Week. " For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model, " said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. " He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades. "
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: This seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euros included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
" Such cases are detrimental to Rome's reputation. We call on the police to investigate the question of whether this is a fraud, " demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant came promptly. The Japanese had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. Also, a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, said the innkeeper.
A call to Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump, indeed, may face impeachment proceedings after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, and the Democrats now want to examine this by investigating the House of Representatives as soon as possible - we are talking about weeks until a decision is made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The whistleblower's accusation, who ultimately brought the conversation to the public with his concern for national security and for democracy of the USA, is monstrous: the president has abused the power of his office to exploit the government of another country to influence the 2020 election. He has exploited Ukraine's dependency in an extortive way and thus force it to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be seen in the meanwhile published transcript of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not reflect the complete wording. However, the telephone call of July 25 is only one episode of a much larger story, in the center of which Trump is primarily his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view, the story begins in May 2019, when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Zelensky, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. " We do not interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation what we have the right to do, " he tells the newspaper. One might think it is inappropriate, but " nothing is illegal about it. " Giuliani wants investigations to be prosecuted in Ukraine for which there is hardly any basis - " because this information will be very, very helpful to my clients and can prove to be helpful to my government. "
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that are fixated on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia's investigation in the US. However, this accusation could never be taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will discuss so prominently ently on the phone with Zelensky in July. Giuliani's and president's version reads: The former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy, Joe Biden, as the Obama administration's Ukraine representative for Ukraine, has urged the dismissal of the then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor tor Schokin, to stop the investigation of the gas company in whose supervisory board his son Hunter Hunter Biden was active. Biden senior financially blackmailed up Ukraine to cover up the corrupt machinations of his family.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General had to leave, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed. Hunter Biden himself was never directly affected. Schokin was also accused of deeply corrupt behaviour, the US government was by no means the only Western partner to push for his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media is down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, Germany, Great Britain and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not loaded again and again since about 3.30 o'clock. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the malfunction, although so far not to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disturbances
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And, as in the previous cases, users also back on Twitter to vent their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the Antarctic ice. They drove a rubber dinghy and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - it took the Chilean rescue helicopter less than an hour to rescue it.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
" At 9: 30 am we received the news, at just before ten we started, and a good 20 minutes later we were over the dinghy. "
Poland has been running Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Attention: NEVER charge smartphone wirelessly
Practical harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently been launched on the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - above all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall another study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature sets battery to
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat generation. If a mobile phone is charged up normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. When charging, on the other hand, the researchers always measured more than 30 degrees on the charging pad, even with the perfect alignment of the smartphone is perfect. If the mobile phone is a little next to the school, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage strength of the charging pad also increases, which in turn drives the power consumption.
Capacity and Lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only buron capacity, but it also does not last so long overall. Thus, the service life is lower. The researchers therefore advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery exchange with high costs is always associated with modern smartphones, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the costs for a battery replacement even again - for all iPhones.

The technology is extremely convenient: simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable clutter and tedious plug-in fumbling. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) a worldwide standard prevails, in which exceptionally even Apple participates, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest traffic jam photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber, according to his own information, climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within only six months. Nirmal Purja (36) had reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition operator announced.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project " Mission Possible. " He has already made international headlines: He took a viral photo in spring of climbers who ing on Mount Everest.
The image of the mass crowd triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848-meter-high mountain and highest peaks on earth. In May, eleven climbers died on the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is partly bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China in China to enable him to climb.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman announced on Friday. " We suspect that the elephants were poisoned. "
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously kept themselves harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year, usually when the animals migrate through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants still live in Sri Lanka. In theory, their killing is punishable by death.
British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its arrest by Iran. According to the news agency IRNA, the Maritime authority of Bandar Abbas announced this. On 19 July, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards had established the tanker flying the British flag on charges of violating the rules of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the criticism
The responsible economic committee of the House of Commons wants to comprehensively investigate the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook. It is about the salary packages of the board as well as about the question of why the British government could not jump financially to the company struggling for survival. " Our interest is the supervision in the company as well as the control by external auditors, " said the committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. " Apparently we are dealing with a bad example of management greed. "
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the familially increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg have come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors such as familial eating habits probably weigh more severely than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colorectal cancer, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog " Electrek. " The demand was strong, so that Tesla could record 110' 000 orders, Musk's circular continued.
The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customers. To do this, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased to this extent in almost four months. Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360' 000 to 400' 000 cars. This requires six-digit figures in the current and next quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were losses losses.
Does British government want to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson restrained
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hiabout whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the law recently passed by parliament against an unregulated Brexit. In response to a question, he merely told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement has been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a " surrender law, " which makes the negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suspected on Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law until the time after the withdrawal from the EU.
Johnson said he is seeking a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is to reach an agreement. "
Iran apparently drives up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased the pressure on the European contractors in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. " Unfortunately, European states show inability or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions, " Rouhani said on Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they did not stand by their promises, he envisaged " further steps " away from the agreements of the labstakously negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement on the prevention of an Iranian nuclear bomb, which contained a commitment to Tehran to normalize Iran's economic relations. In 2018, the US left the agreement on its own in order to Iran to change course with " maximum pressure, " to change the Middle East East policy, which was considered aggressive. President Donald Trump's administration wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher er conditions and is now relying on tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran responded recently by restarting the uranium enrichment limited in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now also using the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium or at least prepared them for use. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not prepared to bear their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of pushing US sanctions, Rouhani suspected. However, there would still be further talks that would hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the mixed situation changed: Germany, France and Great Britain followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the assault. Originally, Iran-supported Houthi rebels in Yemen had claimed themselves for the attack, but the US saw it as a false confession. " We have nothing to do with it, " Rohani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
" Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this, " Rouhani said. However, the European leaders had not been able to do so in talks with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they had only reled that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. In recent days, Rouhani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration must first be lifted, Rouhani demanded. He called on the government in Washington to switch to a policy of " dialogue and reason. "
Comet of other star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This succeeded before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only one conjecture is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was christened 2I / Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The far-travelcomet had been discovered on 30 30 by amateur astronomer Gennady Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-made telescope 65 centimetres in diameter. Follow-up observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not come from our solar system.
2I / Borisov is after 1I /' Oumuamua from 2017 only the second interstellar object to be seen during a passage of our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get a-up insights into a foreign solar system, before it disappears forever. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canaries reported. " The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which at this distance is well above the typical velocities of objects orbiting the Sun, " reported Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa in a message.
According to the analyses, the comet is on a so-called hyperboola orway, which leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) indicated. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially listed under the catalogue number C / 2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I / Borisov, whereby the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellable object that was discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky enough: in contrast to 1I /' Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been seen ghapproach Thus, the researchers have many months for investigation. " The object will reach its highest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible until April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes, " explained Farnocchia. " After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020. "
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I /' Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the comet of the celestial object for 2 to 16 kilometers. Images of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a distinct tail of the comet.
Researchers at the astrophysical Institute of the Canary aries (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. " The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar, " reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years indicates that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such visits are. A planned satellite mission from the European space agency Esa could possibly intercept one of the next interstellar visitors.
The agency intends to stationloy the three-part " Comet Interceptor " spacecraft (comet interceptor) on a waiting position 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it will either lurk for a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor such as 1I /' Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega Airport Daxing
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, the time has come: At the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger plane of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for the captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are to be handled at the new airport every year, and by 2025 it is expected to be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's latest prestige project is also called " starfish " because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which are later to be expanded to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway-new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had announced several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction - and much smaller since 2006, has postponed again and again. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger plane landed after only four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly from London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - that's what the British space agency UK Space Agency is dreof. This is intended to make it possible to make a special propulsion designed for the 2030s (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which is developed by the Reaction Engines from Oxforshire shire, the US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency. " This is the technology that could definitely do this, " said agency agent Graham Turnock the station. " We're talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced. "
In order to drive the project forward, the British Space Agency wants to cooperate more closely with the Australian metropolis. A flight from the British capital to the Australian capital currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to date, the Concorde had covered the route New-Paris covered from 1976 until the closure of its operations in 2003 and it took three to a three and half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred during the launch of a Concorde Airport at the Paris airport Charles de Gaulle, in which all 109 occupants were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US space agency Nasa, the " " X-Plane. " Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
" Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport, " writes Reaction Engines on its homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the " next generation of truly reusable frame devices. "
Uproar in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in the Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair over the possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
" I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information, " Trump said on Thursday to employees of the US embassy to United Nations in New York. The person concerned is almost " a spy " and such has been " a little different " in the past than they is today.
The event was actually out of the public. However, several US media disseminated audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced preparations for impeachment proceedings against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations are based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer, who raises serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. Under great public pressure, the whistleblower's accounts had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received information from several government officials that the US president " uses the power of his office " to make another country interfere in the 2020 US election in his favor.
At the heart of the accusations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in late July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, which concerns previous business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is ahead in the race for democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with a view to the Ukraine telephone call: Leading government employees had endeavoured to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been drawn up However, this had been removed from a commonly provided database from the White House after the conversation on the instructions of lawyers and had instead been stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation report has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The " New York Times " reported that it should be an employee of the foreign intelligence service CIA.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the " so-called whistleblower " had spread second-hand information that had turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, there might be no tipators or spies at all.
However, how Trump said in New York about those who are said to have leaked out information to the whistleblower sparked outrage. US House chairman Nancy Pelosi was worried, complaining that Trump's statement was once again undermining the government's integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations have been underway in various committees against Trump and his entourage for months. In view of the alleged Ukraine, the Democrats are now pushing forward investigations with new force in order to initiate a possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
" The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation, " said the head of the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of a misrepresentation of things and once again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump insults Schiff regularly and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US security and foreign policy officials, most of whom worked under democratic, but also under Republican presidents, backed the Democratic investigation in a statement published on Friday for a possible impeachment procedure. If the accusations come true, it would be " an unscrupulous abuse of power " by Trump, it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could pursue a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision to actually impeachment would fall in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are slim. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
VW Works Council: Jobs are being cut " creeping "
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023. Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved already this year.
A key to this is personnel costs. The " Future Pact, " negotiated between companies and the works council in 2016, already provides for the loss of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In cally, a job at only be reduced can carbe reduced if it is proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security applies until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production, which are actually not at disposal, are " creeping " dismantled via another way - that is, past the official course. Thus, freeing regular jobs would often not be filled.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility of forcing the redeploying. Meanwhile, there is a lack of personnel in many places, the compression increases, the concerns of a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants become greater. Thus, the fear is growing that the vehicle production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. From VW, it only said: " An adjustment of the employment volume takes place as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve. "
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and manage new projects centrally. This, too, is to reduce costs and also accelerate decisions - behind this is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Chief Production Officer Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: " Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof. "
There are already successes in this way: this year, for example, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle will fall compared to the previous previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, is shortened by 1.1 hours. VW does not mention exact figures for production time, according to information from our newspaper it is approximately for the Golf 7.
20
In our region, the main plant Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, VW has the internal rule of thumb that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year so that the plant is satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, the capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - but due to the decreasing diesel demand and the problems with the conversion to the new consumption and exhaust gas test procedure WLTP.
However, as Chief Production Officer Tostmann already announced last year, one million cars are to be rolled off the assembly line in Wolfsburg " in the future. This is make it possible to bundle golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickickau plant is over golf production by converting it to the site for e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations expectations now now on the Golf 8. Despite all the efforts to build up e-mobility, it should remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburgers for the time being.
Forced to prostitution with voodoo: traffickers sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been srigled, sent to the Ruhr area and been forced into prostitution, with six suspected traffickers having to go to prison.
Six suspected traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and prison sentences of up to eight years and three months on Friday in Bochum. The accused had smugelled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian women who willing to leave the country had to take a ritual oath at home in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in inflatable boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. When they arrived in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to work off the alleged smugling costs of an average of 25,000 euros. Therefore, the wages were completely taken from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the smuggling and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothels in the trial. " The work made it physically and mentally difficult for the women, " said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. " Some were properly disgusted. "
The judgments are commercial and band-like smuggling of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
Call for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendant's union Ufo has once again threatened with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will " inform about the industrial action measures in the LH Group on 14 October, " said UFO collective barff member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with the Ufo for months. This also includes the question of whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
Following a decision by the Labour Court of Frankfurt, UFO is now strengthened on this point. Lufthansa wanted to determine that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court dismissed the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined it to appeal against it. " I think it is unlikely that a second court sees the matter completely differently, " said UFO CEO Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the State Labour Court of Frankfurt to have the status of the UFO as a trade union reviewed in court. The company argues that the union had not set up a representative executive board for months and was thus unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the trade union, during which numerous members of the executive board as well as the advisory board resigned, including the long-time trade union leader Nicoley Baublies. Because of the doubts about its leadership, the UFO had suspended an already begun vote about strikes of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July.
Facilitated Entry: Saudi Arabia Announces New Visa System
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not known as an international tourist magnet, but that is about to change. Country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, it wants to increase international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission announced.
" Opening up Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a one-story moment for our country, " said Tourism Commission Chairman Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult for tourists to access. Visas are usually only awarded for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes for more income from the tourism business. According to its statements, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones had hit two of the main oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production collapsed dramatically, the oil price shumps skyrocketed. It should take several weeks for the Kingdom's oil production to return to its old level.

Half of Europe's tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, reported the International Union for Conservation Union IUCN on Friday in Brussels. It examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of these do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of endangerment and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from " potentially endangered " to " endangered, " " endangered, " " endangered " and " extinct in nature " to " extinct. " In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species as endangered worldwide.
rowan and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, rowan (Sorbus) is particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency. " Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or due to the transformation or weakening of their habitats. "
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered " endangered " since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. In addition to a fungus, the Balkan mining moth is poses the greatest threat. It has been spreading since the 1980s from southeastern Europe over the entire continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 specimens. The trees in cities, parks and galleries are not taken into account in this assessment.
Shrubs and mosses also in danger
According to the IUCN scientists compilcreated new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than one fifth of the molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are under threat, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wild, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
" This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet, " said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. " We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority. "
Earthquake off Istanbul: 34 wounded reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey 34 people were injured. According to the information, there were no deaths. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damdamaged. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. On Thursday, the earthquake of magnitude of 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul and triggered panic in the metropolis of millions.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquake in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate.
One of the heaviest quakes was one of magnitude of 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday a quake of the strength 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the half-time show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced that on Twitter. " It won't be bigger, " Shakira wrote for a photo of herself and Lopez. She was excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. It will be in Miami on February 2, 2020.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky on the half-time show then. " Now it's even more special because the NFL lasts 100 years and I'll perform another Latina. " She can't wait to " show what we girls can do on the world's biggest stage. "
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she was honored to stand alongside another artist on one of the largest stages in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. " And then on my birthday! " The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two " queens " were together on a stage.
Shakira is born in Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York City and her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining attendance
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you have recently recently: This February, the spectacle in the USA attracted the fewest viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
The half-time show of the last Super Bowl had been turriar in the run-up: According to media reports, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not not want to appear in the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaenick last February. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then a quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had on his knees in the 2016-17 season before playing the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick ick caused a movement, numerous players took the gesture over. This caused a stir, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been ununited since March 2017 and has not played any NFL game. He accuses the associations of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook's bankruptcy: Hotels get money from the insurance company
According to a press report, some banks are likely to deur the bankruptcy of travel provider Thomas Cook. There is a high risk of depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans. This also affects Credit Suisse, writes the " Financial Times " in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit, Credit Credit and Credit Suisse would have to make depreciation of up to £1.8 billion (around EUR 2 billion) on their books, the report said, as estimates by the consulting firm AlixPartners have shown.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept depreciation of £900 million to 1 billion and the lenders between £550 and £825 million, with the actual amounts to be written ed more likely to be at the upper end of the bandwidth, an expert told the paper.
How great the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end will become apparent after the end of the insolvency proceedings. A person close to this procedure did not exude too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in Great Britain are " old " and many of the properties are in bad locations. Most money can probably be extracted with the sale of the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook, it was further.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. " We cannot rule this out, but we have no reliable information about it, " said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. " They come without passports. "
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, ramming a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects are said to have arrived. Investigations run against the captain for aiding on illegal immigration.
United States warn federal government of Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the German government against trusting the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great, " Pai told " Handelsblatt " with regard to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a " national security law " that obliges every company " under Chinese jurisprudence " to follow instructions from the security bodies.
Current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, " said the FCC CEO, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a " declaration of trustworthy " from suppliers.
Berlin first wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the " Handelsblatt, " citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, " said Pai.
It is " very difficult to imagine " that a government agency, " no matter where, would be able to review every single update in real time in order to track down security risks, " the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The employee society, which allegedly owns the company, is not necessarily independent of the government, " Pai told the " Handelsblatt. "
The USA had insights into that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently in favour of talks in Berlin to promote the position of the USA.
Chemical Factory in Northern France Burns: Schools Closed
During the night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic wall of fire illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday as a precaution, the responsible prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to the smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There was still the risk that smell would spread after the extetion, so the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 policemen and gendarmes were used at the fire there.
A gigantic black column of smoke had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations that are particularly monitored. In Seveso, Italy, near Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that no " high levels of toxicity " had been detected in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. Dams against pollution had been built up in the river, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 2: 40 a.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: " Germany must invest now "
The French Minister of Economy and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better, " said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for next year.
The eurozone economy is weak, the minister warned.
We must not wait for the economic situation to worsen in order to take the necessary decisions. "
If those states that have budgetary scope for more investment had to act, Le Maire said with regard to Germany, among other things.
France does not have these margins, the minister added, pointing to its country's high public debt, which is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. French public debt must be " stabilized " and " reduced, " said Le Maire.
In recent years, appeals have come from France to Germany to make more public investment in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to manage its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax reductions of more than nine billion euros for households.
Among other things, the French government is reacting to the protests of the Yellow Vest movement. New indebtedness is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to the expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson avoids question about Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticizes the " surrender law " passed by the parliament.
The parliament is back, a law requires the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics, however, fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Asked about this possibility, however, the Tory politician avoids.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hiabout his whether to impose an unregulated Brexit - despite the law recently passed by parliament, which is to prevent that. When asked, Johnson merely told journalists that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement has been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a " surrender law, " which makes the negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major suspected on Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural trick postponing the entry into force of the law until the time after leaving the EU. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is to reach an agreement. "
Johnson's Chief Advisor, Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said that he felt the political clashes over Brexit as a " walk in the park " and was confident that the desired exit from the EU would come about: " We enjoy this, we will win, we will leave (ed.), don't worry, " Cummings, told the British newspaper Telegraph at a book launch.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign " Vote Leave " during the election campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as chief strategist in the British seat of government at Downing Street. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.

" She wanted real moments, " writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course, one is always the focus: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen before.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephones in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears bulky moon boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but which also led a completely normal life beyond the headlight on their farm in southern England or in Scotland. For example, Mary McCartney said according to the BBC that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And it has not always been tidy up with the McCartneys.
Like no other medium, the poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's shots are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than snapshots.
It's about deciding Click: You have to recognize if a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to take it at exactly the right moment, " said Paul McCartney. " If you take two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo. " And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing exactly the right moment. " She just knew she did, " Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the frame and the colors are right, which makes " The Polaroid Diaries " not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to everything anecdotal, where landscapes also look like abstract paintings. The perfect complement to the newly released Beatles album " Abbey Road, " which was released exactly 50 years ago.
" We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran "
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from the neighboring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue buying our natural gas from there, " said Erdogan in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems with the import of Iranian oil, as some companies had " withdrawn because of the US threats. "
Nevertheless, Turkey " will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues, " said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its withdrawal from the international nuclear deal with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of " maximum pressure " on the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not complying with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran's oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably.
US government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. The US State Department declared on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be reduced from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, corresponding to a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said that the US would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overburdened.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on the reception of two refugee groups: people who are being persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus been at risk, according to the State Department's statement. However, a maximum 1,500 refugees are to be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
With the program launched in 1980, refugees selected selected from selected camps around the world and resettled in the USA. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the budget year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. Even the current upper limit of 30,000 is a low. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was just under 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted in horror to the lowering of the upper limit. " This is a very sad day for America, " said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US - both legally and illegally. The US government claims to be expecting 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - " Come close to a spy "
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage in the whistleblower affair. Whoever has evidence to the informant who accused him of abusing of power " comes close to a spy, " Trump said, according to a recording of a private event in New York on Thursday. Several US media agree on this.
According to this, Trump spoke in front of staff of the American UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, " This comes close to a spy. " Then Trump added, " Do you know what we did in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now. "
Observers rated the latter's remark of a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats strongly criticized Trump's statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. It was also an attempt to hinder a congressional investigation into possible impeachment proceedings against him, wrote the chairmen of the Foreign, Intelligence and Supervision Committee in the House of Representatives.
In a recent complaint, the whistleblower accuses the president of having abused his office to ask for interference from another country in the US election in 2020. Specifically, the is concerned include his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky in the summer: In the conversation, Trump encouraged him to open an investigation against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower himself and his informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is an analyst of the CIA.
Refugee boat capsized: Baby and infants drown in Aegean
Again and again, people try to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea. Regularly, the often much-too small boats capsize. During the sinking of a rubber boat, seven migrants have now died - including five children.
Seven Greek Greek migrants were killed in the sinking of a rubber dingboat. Among the fatalities were also a baby and four other children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is said to be a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small archipelago of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not yet known from which countries the migrants come from. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferred to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in many too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 174 people died on this route.
The Who break off the concert
A US concert of the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end because of an ungiability of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston his voice failed the service. At the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: " I think I should leave it as long as it is still running. "
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey " really can really speak now. " Townsend promised the audience that they would get their money's worth at a reparation concert. However, a date has not yet been set.
Performances planned for Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver cancelled The Who. They are to be made up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band mate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band was formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly set: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from a small startup to a driving force on the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. A few days ago, the company had deposed founder Adam Neumann as boss, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the executives in order to gain financial leeway for the coming the weeks and months. In addition, the British " Financial Times " reports that WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate immediate effect. Thus, among example, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly off the market in New York and London.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and rents it out to members in the short term in partly small units. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. Up to now, WeWork burns money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company made a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs by renting ever new large areas are said to have risen to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new company management is now to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped the rental of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with maturities of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell's Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, has leased almost 300,000 square meters of office space in the past 24 months. WeWorks new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new space on the market during that time. Without WeWorks expansion, the office vacancy in the US metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in the " Business Insider. " Similarly, in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in a best location.
In the British capital, too, the balance in the real estate market could be noticeably striking a further expansion of the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant in an office building purchased last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their real estate for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the hoped-for billion ons revenues. They do not have access to - already scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term leases. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by specially founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of another 262 poachers have been arrested who had fished illegally in the waters, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB told the Interfax agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot at and three of them injured. This time there were no casualties, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on the road in Russian territorial waters. According to their own statements, the Russian Coast Guard is patrols there to protect their marine biological resources. During the new controls, 30,000 squid were been discovered. In addition, according to three fishing and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, the Coast Guard found out a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
Even according to complaints by local entrepreneurs, the Russian fishing authority had not issued any fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily arrested there in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorsky sky, Georgi Martynonov, recently complained of the high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also be used to remove small creatures from the seaside. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need 200 years to be discomposed. Even the ships themselves did not comply with the hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the arrests during the previous week. According to the FSB, a North Korean who was also wounded, later died of his injuries. On September 17, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second one after it had opened fire.
US imposes a ban on entry against ex-President Castro
The US has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, as the US State Department justified in a statement on Thursday with Castro's involvement in " gross human rights violations. " As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he presides over a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there, by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. " The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela, " tweeted American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump had issued bans on entry on Wednesday against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a fierce struggle has has been raging between the government and the opposition for months. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions on Maduro's government in order to bring him to his knees and help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan GuGuaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents of the government.
New Fridays for Future climate protests
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are likely to start because of the time difference before the protests spread across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How great the worldwide response on this Friday after the record participation of the previous week will be is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was in good spirits. " Last Friday, more than four million people went on strike for the climate. We'll doing again this Friday!, " she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
Particularly in Germany the influx last Friday was very large. According to estimates by Fridays for Future, a good third of all demonstrators - around 1.4 million - participated in the protests in 575 German cities. This time, according to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg sat in front of the Swedish legislature in August 2018 in order to call on their country's politicians to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. From this, the Fridays for Future movement emerged within a short period of time. Students and students in particular take part in the climate protests, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they are demanding more ambition from politicians in the fight against earth heating and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be contained to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York less than a month ago after a two-week transatlantic cruise with a high-sea racing yacht. There, she recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke to the heads of the state and government of the world in her conscience. In her native Stockholm, she had been awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future, which envisages a change in fire protection. " This also applies to smoking, " said a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency in Moscow on Thursday according to the agency Tass. The ban is due to enter into force on 1 October.
Those who still smoke must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros) If the cigarette should light a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the ministry, the prohibition also includes burning candles. It is no longer allowed to grill skewers on the balcony.
Bke Against Cybercriminals - Investigators Remove Servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time dug out a large server provider for illegal business on the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, through which internationally active criminals operated their machinations.
This was announced by the Prosecutor General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world's second largest Darknet marketplace for drugs, " Wall Street Market, " which investigators had smashed in the spring. According to the Prosecutor General at the end of November 2016, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers was also controlled via a server in the cyberbunker.
Such a hoster was first excavated in Germany, it was said. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
With the support of special forces such as the GSG9, there had been searches in Germany and neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New Fridays for Future global climate protests
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests ǀ Who are actually Thunberg's backers?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoking factories, which up the climate. All the more astonishing that a 16-year-old girl of all people holds the mirror in front of the nose of the power people of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and gets young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win over a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a more just world. At that time, he was also able to win over a crowd of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea in order to reach the promised land, just as Greta Thunberg went on the journey to America with a sailboat.
But is there a dark side in this regard? Why does it take a share called " We don't have time " to save the world? In addition, Greta Torunhas had rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which has sold widely, thanks to the daughter standing in the spotlight. Also well-tried followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably also too thick for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into the media in the world very well and it flows a lot of money thanks to the impressive action.
Here the spirits now differ: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain circles of people work together with stock brobrokers during the world rescue campaign? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is ever more important in a democratically influenced society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question seemingly pious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crossing our solar system
A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The astronomers' conjectures have been confirmed: a foreign comet is currently intersecting our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet of another star is currently secting our solar system. It was christened 2I / Borisov after its discoverer and is employing astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in the Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov in the Crimea. He looked up at the sky with a self-made telescope and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. He is only the second of its kind, which was sighted during passage.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to catch insights into a foreign solar system up close. Apparently, the coming is similar to those of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reports. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently on a so-called hyperbolic orway that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before that happens, the astronomers can observe it in detail, because unlike its predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in its approach, which means that it can be studied from Earth for many months. " The object will reach its highest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020, " explains Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa. " According to this, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020. "
The new visitor's predecessor: 1I / 2017 U1 " Oumuamua. "
First findings on 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years may allow a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again, asteroids occupy the researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid raced past the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
" Absolutely reprehensible ": Rachel Johnson horrified by Brother
Boris Johnson is lonelier. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister clearly clearly castigates the warlike language of the prime minister as " tasteless. " It is not the brother she knows.
" Capitrender, " " Fraud, " Treaty ": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to upgrade - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this met with massive outrage from the opposition, and in the meantime other critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother was using words like surulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were being " hanged ed protracted, quartered, tarred and feathered. " She thought that very reprehensible. She doesn't recognize her brother's version again, said Rachel Johnson, who ran for " Change UK " in the EU Parliament elections for the anti-Brexit party.
In particular, she came across the fact that her brother Jo Cox mentioned that an EU-friendly general MP who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 withdrawal referendum. Their memory could best be honored by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson in the House of Commons had said. " It is very tasteless to refer to a MP who was murdered by someone who called' Britain first', " now criticized Johnson's sister. The perpetrator had obviously come out of the far-right camp, which felt " strengthened by this kind of language. " For all those who mourned for her, it was very tasteless.
The widower of Cox also sharply criticized the Prime Minister. " It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like this, " he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to stand passionately and resolutely for what one believe in - no matter what view one is. But, one should never " demonize the other side. " He also complained that an atmosphere had emerged in which attacks have become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson had resigned from his younger brother Jo as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory MP. " In recent months, I have been tortorn between loyalty to the family and the national interest - it's an indissoluble tension, " Jo Johnson explained the move.
Johnson's language also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is " not worthy of this country. " In a joint statement they declared: " In recent days, the language, both in debates and outside parliament, has been unacceptable. We should speak with respect to each other. "
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is sending out a strong signal: In the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear. They promise " an explosion of fun and energy. "
Latina power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show in the upcoming final of the US Football League NFL, as the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
" I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, which has incredible strength in the US, " Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people with Latin American roots live. Shakira (" Waka Waka ") comes from Colombia, Lopez (" On the Floor ") is of Puerto Rican origin.
" I love the Super Bowl putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas, " Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises " an explosion of fun and energy " for the show.
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed big hits with songs like " Waiting For Tonight " or " Let's Get Loud " and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the drama " Hustlers " in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She achieved her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single " Whenever, Whereever. "
The announcement of the half-time guests is eagerly awaited every time in every US. This year, many also see the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, more over 100 million television viewers watch the NFL final, it is now extremely popular in Germany.
Last year, there were political controversy. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise up in protest against the police against blacks when playing playing the national anthem and had been tackled by US President Donald Trump. In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a Super Bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 appeared was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber adds Egypt's ruler: For the time being Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have an influence on whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt both spent the abroad last week. One of them floated in again at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 had deposed the Muslim Brotherhood Mohamed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's crackdown on political Islam, and lost no syllable on the human rights abuses on the Nile - in a week in Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they dared to protest against the president. He had had no reason for concern, " Sisi said at the airport in the microfones of state television. " The Egyptians do not themselves be be led astray. "
According to the president, the other man, who is currently determining the events on the streets, tries to do. amed., of course, stayed abroad, where he eludes the grip of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafés, living rooms and tea rooms: with his YouTube channel " Mohameds Mysteries, " Ali calls on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He approaches the head of the state directly and in a thoroughly rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president indulge in luxury and let magnificent new palaces be built, it is said. The army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with exactly these masters for 15 years in his second job as a contractor, he seems to know quite well what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding click numbers show.
After thousands had demonstrated against his rule last week for the first time since Sisi's grip on power and almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a " million-dollar march " for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would really venture into the streets. But there were isolated minor protests, for example in Gisa near Cairo and in the village of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded its handling. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos did not be independently first. Verially, security circles said that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators tore banners with the portrait of the president to pieces last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and on the arterial streets. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed for " maintenance, " most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on Rabaa Square, where supporters of the overthrown Muslim-Brother MMori entrenched themselves in 2013 until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent discontgathering: Sisi's future party wanted to hold a large-scale demonstration for the president.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: " Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square, " Ali said in Barcelona in his video camera. " Let us not clash with police officers. " But as a rerebe this is not to be understood: " All of Egypt is Tahrir Square. "
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
Who concludes an Internet contract does not need to blindly trust the speed information of the providers. Customers can check in case of abnormalities themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
After all, the previously promised transfer rates are part of the contract and should therefore be achieved, explains the consumer association Bayern.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
" However, the tests of the providers are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively, " the consumer association Bayern points out on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised service. This is best done by those affected in writing by inser@-@ letter.
If this does not effect anything even after multiple requests, customers can terminate and possibly also claim damages. However, in the absence of success, only the course of action will help.
First senior Republican for investigation
As the first senior Republican, the mont Governor has arguout in favor of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are established, " said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower's affair before action - an impeachment process can lead to the removal of the president - is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Trump has been observing Biden " for years. "
Republicans have so far refrained from criticising Trump for the whistleblower's affair; few have shown uneasy about it. Scott's statements are the first indicative of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly turned against Trump's policies, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.

While capsizing a refugee boat in the Aegean, one baby and four other children drowned. Overall, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were saved.

In return, the EU wanted to take in a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is progressing on the Greek side due to a shortage of personnel.

Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Allegedly, Jaqueline Ng was promised an upgrade by email from Cathay Pacific. However, when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed to be on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for Business Class - many passengers dream of that. Sometimes they are lucky, and the check-in staff offer a change from Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how one should not do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng has more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the outbound flight, the employees refused to upgrade Jaquupgrade, although she had shown an e-mail in which Cathay Pacific Pacific allegedly promised her an upgrade. Influencerin wants to receive the letter from an airline marketing employee. However, the airline accuses Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline again again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they checked at the head office. And indeed, the employee from whom the mail originated is said to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system, in which the messages did not appear.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaquelines Ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new flight tick to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the costs for the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: the influencer has committed fraud for Cathay and remains blocked for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now calls s a lawyer.
Oil prices decline according to ceasefire report in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon within a very short time. A barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The slide was triggered by a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia brought five percent of global oil production to a standstill in mid-September. Houthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, the focus could be on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Commodity Strategy Division at Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices are thus continuing its downward movement over the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up nearly $59, Brent nearly $65.
Most recently, Bloomberg had reported, citing insiders, that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia was progressing faster than expected after the attack in mid-September. Accordingly, the production volume had again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved again in the direction of the original quantity.
Most recently, there have been several press reports citing insiders who report rapid progress by the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in repair work. However, raw ty experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation ation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil oil tanker " Stena Impero " is on its way more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently granted release to leave the port. The crew is now preparing for departure while the ship is still at anchor, shipping director Erik Hånell told Swedish radio in a text message on Friday morning.
But the US announced that it would move off missiles and soldiers to Iran's arch-enemy in Saudi Arabia. Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the United Kingdom had at times driven up oil prices in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump intensify
In the affair over possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, accusation allegations against the White House have been voiced. Several leading government officials have made intensive efforts to prevent access to the text of the conversation after a controversial telephone call between Trump and President President Volodymyr Selensky in late July, according to an anonymous whistleblower. The spokesperson of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of " cover-up. " Trump spoke of a " witch hunt. "
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that a third summit of leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon be place in the nuclear dispute. The sense and prospects of success of such a meeting are questionable due to a lack of progress in implementing agreements of the first summit in Singapore, top plomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday according to the agency KCNA.
The US has so far done nothing to implement the summit's decisions last year, the North Korean State Department adviser said. He also criticized tightened US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the US and South Korea. However, he hoped for a " wise " and " courageous " decision by Trump to bring back another rapprochement.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he explained it. Negotiations on disarmament of North Korea's nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit meeting of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the consultations, but so far without much success.

Pounds under pressure - interest rate cut expected
British pounds under pressure
With an imminent rate cut, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt Speculation about an imminent rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) is hitto the pound sterling. The British currency was reduced by up to 0.4 percent on Friday to 1.2269 dollars.
The sales were triggered by statements made by central bank Michael Saunders, who brought a cut in interest into discussion, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising, since Saunders was considered an advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy from the Brexit hickhack, without directly signalling a cut in rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU on 31 October, even without a divorce agreement.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's integrity chief of the World Athletics Federation.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics ahead, new details on the doping scandal in Russia are being revealed - and they are destroying the little credibility that the Russian sport had regained the the beginning of the year and even to to a an extent. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the rehearsals from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport was unveiled. The Wada had banned the Russian Anti-doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banished from the world stage. After to individual examination, the International Olympic Committee let around 270 athletes from the country compete under a neutral flag at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, 168 Russian athletes in February 2018 at the Winter Games in February 2018. They were also allowed to take part in the World Cups in the various sports, in the summer even the Football Cup World Cup with the host as participants took place in Russia.
Positive findings missing
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban again, but demanded access to the laboratory and the samples in question. The data were intended to provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They were to help to punish athletes retrospectively. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
The chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed, however, that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory has been manipulated. " Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force received the right data, " David Howman said in an interview with the " Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung " on Friday. " We found out numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a whistlower lower and those that she received from the Russians in January. " Many positive findings were that were mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Federation is the only organization to hold on to the spell of Russia. At the World Championships in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already launched manipulations and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening to restrict the Rusada again and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
