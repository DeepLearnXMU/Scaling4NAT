Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday September 27th, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the whereabouts are unclear. The opposition speaks of a " frightening " scale.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are repeatedly disappearing - many many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is the result of a list of the Federal Ministry of Defence classified as a classified information, on which the editorial network Germany reports.

In addition, 30 weapon tubes for MG3 machine guns are missing.
The extent of weapons and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr is " frightening, " said the left-wing member the Bundestag Martina Renner. This is all the more true because hardly anything had been found in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a " poor balance. " Renner criticized that the list did not show whether the the missing ammunition was also the one that had been found in connection with the investigation against the Federal military officer Franco A., who was under suspion of terrorism. " And this even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted for possession of this ammunition, " said Renner.

More than two months after its determination by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas today, Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set to move and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates was indicated as the destination port.

Musk aims for delivery record
Tesla's quarter may hold a record. Despite the delivery boom, there have recently been losses at the electric car company.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. " We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, " Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek. "
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could record 110,000 orders, Musk's circular continued. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customers. To do this, Tesla had to muster as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.

Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were losses losses.
Puzzles solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress had also been made on the question of why children defend themselves so fiercely against tickling only to demand more.
Finally, it has also become clear why the approach of a tickling hand alone triggers laughter even before the touch. This is due to a deep-lying layer the cerebrum, which already triggers laulauin the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, earlier research has shown that rats react with " laughter " in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans. This " laughter " is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-contact
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and contact by others - that is why humans cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out in the experiments on the that laulaughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during self-touch. This is also the case if living beings clean themselves. However, during the foreign contact and the tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh had been fied.
But if the self-touch and touch by others happen at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between self-touch and touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because self-contact activates a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Accordingly, they sometimes aborted this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showing escape behavior or frighness. This ambivalence resembles the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.

Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. British oil tanker Stena Impero, " detained in Iran, was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero, " which has been held in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After approval by the Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The " Stena Impero " has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, explained shipping company manager Erik Hånell. Around noon the ship had left Iranian waters. " It's great that it is over, " he told the Swedish TV station SVT.
The State Department in London described the fixing of the ship as illegal. " This is part of a model of attempts to affect the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law, " a a said on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on 19 July on charges of having violated regulations of the law of the sea sea the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September.. According to the circumstances, the remaining 16 crew members were doing well, said Hånell. In view of the difficult difficult and grueling situation situation they professionally over the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working on reunite them with their families as quickly as possible.
Behind the of the " Stena Impero, " the British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: At the beginning of July a super tanker with oil from Iran, which is said to have been destined for Syria, had been chained there. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of " piracy " and threatened consequences. In mid-August, the " Adrian Darya-1 " was finally released. London vehemently rejected, susptures that it was a barter to get the " Stena Impero " released.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of part the world's oil exports are shipped through the it it. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The US withdrew from the international nuclear agreement on its its 2018 which which was to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been preson the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to enforce a stricter agreement that is extended to other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Due to the dispute over the " Stena Impero " and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative " Coalition of Hope " for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protpowers, wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is obcking a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
India would actually be predestined to be a " war profiteer. " given the unitive tive tariffs that America's Donald Trump imposes on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to rearrange. Financial execiefs Asian firms that are considering moving their production from China to another country cite India as one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS poll. However, this not only to do with the the uncertainties of the Sino American American trade war. With a huge pool of young labor and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems designed to play a more significant role in the globally widespread production chain.
But now India itself has come into Trump's focus. Pejoratively titled the " " Kingdom of tariffs " by the White House war, America America withved emerging economies of trade trade breaks for 2000 products in early June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and demanding better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, however, the friction with India is merely a sideshow. Moreover, America also views the world's largest democracy through security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington are concerned ried about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a volvo of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just started a second five-year term, is therefore likely to lull himself in safety.
The problem, however, lies in a different place: The empirically confirmed thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult time in the socialist republic of India. Even under Modi. Its eagess for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that stiocated every entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies now receive building permits for buildings faster. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more touchy insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for liquidating seemingly dead companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. Out of economic look, much has changed for the better in India in the first five years of modes. However, this does not apply in trade policy. Inspired by protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even erected new barriers.
In the West, Modi depends on the nimbus of the energetic reformer who radically renews his country economically, not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At its core, however, the " India First " lawyer never straaway from a protectionist economic policy, preventing Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the isolation of their their industries are among the regular voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.

However, the strength were still still enough to stop stop running running wristwatch after the finish. As if the scene hadn't been curious enough.
" I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same, " said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly attracted the attention of the journalists journalists.. Shy, he evdged aded, didn't want to talk about his heroic deat all all. After, he wanted to set his his personal best and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help one fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he shouldn't even been allowed to start. " That's why I'm proud to run here for my country, " he said.
He did this emphatically that evening - and much more intensively than he would have imagined. Because this heroic deed will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even gave his competitor Busby the lead at the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead aries. In the end, everything had no use, because Busby, who only reached the the finish with a of help, was disdisby the World Athletics Association Association for for this the end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, took eted to set a personal best at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18: 10.87 minutes, but he himself was nevertheless disappointed: " I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. I've been under 18 minutes. " However, only in training, best times do not count.
Millions mash: Egyptians are gearing for wild day of day
In Egypt, the security measures were strengthened in the run-up to possible protests critical of the government. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, the police had already stepped up their street checks and searched the pedestrians' mobile phones partly for news and photos in connection with the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants, opagainst the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whom critic accuse of corruption and mismanagement. There had not been an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. Egyptian building contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who in in exile in Spain, who launched the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a " millions of march " in central places in the country for today, Friday. Ali calls for a " people's revolution. " The man is not a " good for for young young Egyptieither because he he raked millions as a subcontractor for the army, but his messages are arriving.
According to two observer groups, the number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Nevertheless, these figures could not be confirmed at first. The government also confirmed did did not comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were " arbitrarily arrested " " just because they were' in the wrong place at the wrong time', " HRW said, citing lawyers those detainees. According to their lawyers, the allegusagainst the detainainrange from from " dissemating false information " membership membership in a " terrorist organization. " Cairo Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW, also arbitrarrarily and searched passers-by.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo bloblocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: mail order companies should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be exempted from the VAT on donations in kind, the Ministry explained on a question from the Green parliamentary group, about which the newspapers of the sparmedia group reported on Friday. However, the retailders could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay little or no VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens send back every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - then ended up in the garbage. DonDonating them would current legal situation, cost cost the current additional money, because the tax authorities evaluate donations in kind as a turnover, which then incurs VAT.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-EckEckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear in a decree that companies can evaluate non-saleable products accordingly and donate them non non profit organizations free of charge. Companies must be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This applies not only to online trade, but also to other businesses from fashion fashion to the hardware stores.
Banksy art for auction: there was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of street art star Banksy, " Devolved Parliament, " is to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines " the regression of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic attitude shaped by animals and tribes. " From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in south-west Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had exhibited the painting again - coinciding with the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work, formerly called " Question Time, " was renamed " Devolved Parliament. "
The image could change hands for a amount of millions.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had a hard exchange with the opposition at the first meeting of the House of Commons on Wednesday, following repeal of a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to carry out Brexit which has already been postponed twice on October 31, if necessary even without an agreement with the EU.
This is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture depicting a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. Thousands of truck drivers and other visitors see the plant entering the UK every day.
Brexit debate is like a " walk in the park "
According to his top adviser, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fierce verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a " walk in the park, " Dominic Cummings said at a book launch on Friday. " We enjoy.. We will (from the EU) and we will win. "
Johnson had harshely attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days, accusing them, among other things, of " betraying " the people. He dismissed missed usations that he could endMPMPs risk danger because they they target target death of death as a " humbug. "
Cummings said the only way to return calm was for MEPs finally respected the British decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were upset that Britain had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, Friday Friday even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint. " We should speak to each other with respect, " a statement said. " And we should also listen. "
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, in his first appearance before the UN Assembly, once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN General Debate in New York. " If things goes badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst. " The United Nations has a responsibility for Kashmir. " You should have prevented that. "
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers dominate one part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had deprived the Indian Kashmir region of autonomy and thus abruptly increased tensions in relations with Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is reacting hard to the current protests in Egypt. It is is shooting at the population with live ammunition, more than 2,000 detainees join joining the 60,000 political who are already detained there in prisons. Protesting has never been harmdanger in Egypt. However, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2013, the state apparatus been everything it can to avoid a scenario such that during the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, a lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one's own government drove millions onto the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi cannot get a grip on, no matter how tough it is against adversaries. The situation has even worsened.
Today, one in person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the largest economic player. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian Egyptian people have lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an an old one. It becomes critical whenever large parts of the population have difficulty to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER CEO: No more " showstoppers " for capital airport
For two months, it was checked whether the complicated system network of BER fire protection works in interaction. Operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv inspections in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there were still shortienings in the terminal to be dealt with. " We have many detailed topics, but we do not have a real show stopper. " He assured that the schedule for commissioning still contained buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve is no longer likely to be too large. The construction construction notification is now to be submitted to the building authority during the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables still need to be remedied; Tüv wants to examine them by February. " In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work must to be carried on to with the deficiencies, " said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no approval for all dowels on which the cable routes hang. The airport boss expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not yet work satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time, it is about smoke aprons that shut down like a canvas in the event of a fire so that the smoke does not spread. They drive down too far. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then, there will be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Costs have risen from two billion since the start of in 2006 to an expected around 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. That is why it should to happen at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Chief Human Resources Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put airport finances on a firm footing.

" AviationNetOnline " had previously reported on this.
The Viennese base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will thus be de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. The AUA will take over this from January 2020 in the " etetase ase " " including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg to fly fly Salzburg Salzburg and Innsbruck charter charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Roufrom Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, explained the spokesman. Flight flight are to be adjusted to connecting flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a " production company " for the sister sister AUA. For and Rome, among others, would be operated with an AUA flight number, but primarily with a Eurowings device. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but like the AUA in Terminal 3.
After the Niki bankruptcy, a price war broke out at Vienna Airport. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced announced on Thursday that it would increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. Irish low-cost airline will send four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called " wetlease, " which the union criticized as a circumvention of the collective agreement.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's announcement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, AUA CEO Andreas Otto replied on Friday: " We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years. "

Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy eating - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
By analysing the genetic material of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to investigout the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is the the with 12.5 million euros euros. From Switzerland the high mountain Clinic Davos, which belongs by the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the main controllable able factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic etic help determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is is insufficiently known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genome of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Cardiovascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - are known, according to the hospital. Every year, about 200 are added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be used in the research of other common diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Cardiovcular Center. New New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there was a firm will to use the data to research other diseases. So far, the Foundation's clinic in Davos has been treated treating allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular PrecMedicine is is to be built at the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics is to be created. To explain his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland, said that he had been operated on on an open heart in Hamburg three years ago and was very gratefully.
The bibio samples of the healthy participants come from hamburgers, who also participate in the " Hamburg City Health Study. " According to the hospital, this is the largest local health study in the world with 45,000 test persons. Decderypgenetic material pays strictly attention attention to the protection of anonyymed data, the scientists assured. It is one petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the genetic's of a can now be decoded within 24 hours. The pure material costs for this would be 1300 euros. The The gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, has cost cost several hundred euros euros The study study is to begin on 1 October, and all 9,000 samples are to be analysed by the end of 2020. Initial results are expected the following year.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koranic school. According to information from local residents, security forces searched the school in the norerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were still underage, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. " The victims were reused, some of whom claimed to have been raped by their teachers, " Sabo said.
The boys were detained under the pretext of being taught and " improved " in the Koran. Indeed, the protégés had been detained by their teachers under " most degrading and inhumane conditions, " said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran school had existed for about ten years. Residents had drawn the attention of the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. Sabo said parents were shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Korur an school. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. According to the police, the operator and six employees were arrested.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koranic schools. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have therefore fled across the border to the neighbouring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chaained and tortured: Nigeria's police release 400 children from school
Policemen have freed 400 students from appalling backgrounds in a school in northern Nigeria. " Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture, " said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children had been discovered on Thursday after a hint in an Islamic school. The conditions there were " inhumane. " The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, had been held like slaves at their school and put in chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television pictures showed emaciated and injured students in a noticeably poor state of health.
World football election: Further accusations after Messis and Klopp's freestyle
Football " Signature not valid "
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Association FIFA awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth award and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football baller election, accusations come to FIFA from other countries. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
Much of FIFA has proved to be disreputable in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt functionaries. However, the FIFA world football baller election has not yet been suspected of being unclean - apart from the fact that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote according to sympathy rather than objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
FIFA apologizes that " the signatures on the electoral forms were issued in capital letters and therefore not valid. " The Egyptian association was contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan's coach also astonished
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally rated: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk on second and Sadio Mané on third. According to FIFA, however, the vote received in the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also raised accusations: " Did not not vote for the TheBest2019 Awards. All All about about my vote is wrong, you, " he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
The association came the message on Friday: True, but of course it was no intentional. The completed documents had had been " ereenly " provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it said in a statement from the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had actually elected. " We take responsibility for the administrative error, " " it said in the communication. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, " just as it says in the official list of FIFA. "
FIFA now has the other cases examined in an investigation, but stresses that the electoral process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world football baller election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine affair: Senior Republicans call for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly advocated an official investigation against US President and party friend Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, " said Vermont Republican Governor Phil Scott. " Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are established established. " wants to know more about the whistleblower affair air action is is.. An impeachment process can lead to the missal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been watching Biden " for years. "
The Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump for the whistleblower affair, and few have shown unease about it. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. With the governor governor Virginia Virginia already opposed Trump's policies policies several times, such as relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Another senior Republican, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker advocfor the investigation. " It's a deeply disturbing situation, " said aker said. " The right course of action and responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it. "
Scott and Baker, as governors of US states, have no formal say in the case against Trump, which is decided in Congress Congress. Their statements are therefore especially symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first Republican senators have also been critical of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the Second Chamber Representatives, said that the case was " extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing. " US media also report that the first cracks are up internally among Republicans.
The affair could result in the opening of impeachment proceedings against Trump, with the House Democrats have ing an, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for impeachment. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could use a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on actual impeach would be taken in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects of such such a procedure are slim. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board Rackete's " Sea Watch "?
Three men were arrested in Sicily and allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had officially headed to the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship " Sea Watch 3 " and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - including by Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations are being made against Rackete. Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have arrived in Italy with the " Sea-Watch 3. " The pects have been caught in a reception camp in Messina SicSicily) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. " We cannot rule this out, but we have no reliable information about it ourselves, " said " Sea Watch " spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
In mid-September, the police reported that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered, Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). " The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence, " the statement said at the time.
NGOs and aid organisations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. " We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports, " NeuNeuauer auer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are eing eing Libya It It therefore therefore quite likely that are also be perpetrators on the ships. " It is therefore very important that this is investigated. "
Italy's right-wing former interior minister, Matteo Salvini, immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still under investigated in Italy for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
Musk aims for delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, " Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the Electrek industry blog.
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could record 110,000 orders, Musk's k continued. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customers. To do this, Tesla had to muster as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares left trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. To do this, six-digit figures are required in the current and coming quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were losses losses.
US budget dispute: Again only bridge bridge financing
The new fiscal year will begin in the US on October 1 without a decent budget. Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional financing by November 21.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending plans before the new fiscal year beginning on October 1. The Senate Senate the the of Representatives on Thursday and passed on ContinuResolution (CR) by November 21. Without such a decision, a a shutdown would occurred occurred midnight at on Monday, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump has yet to put the decision into force.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration is now being financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019, which ends on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot benefit for the being being from the expenditure framework for the new financial year from 1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion.
The Democrats have passed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has more or less willing ten of the twelve spending plans that are barcapable to win a majority.
The ghosts differ above all on the issue of resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the Wall, one of President Trump's major priorities. The Democrats are disthered by the Wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the construction of the Wall the ghosts part
At present, it is unclear how the parties intend to get closer on this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November, nor a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the backdrop of continuing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity TemplPresentation p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the previous year's level, prevent the travel of parliamentarians and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were were place.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination will also be open to women and lesbians living alone in in the future: Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority majority in favour of a government under allows all women can benefit from in vitro insfertiliination. Thus thus increase increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The proposal still requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing had warned that in the future numerous " children without a father " could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an " opportunity " for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the costs of artificial insemination for all women should be borne by social security.
Fertilization with sperm of dead husband further prohibited
By a narrow majority, on the other hand, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to the sperm of their their husband for artificial insemination. In In Belgium, and Great Britain, artificial insinsemination " post-mortem " is. In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women complained in vain for the render of the sperm of a deceased person. Opponents of the advance in Paris argued that such a begten child would then bear a " particularly difficult fate. "
Numerous deputies of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and MPuties the other hand, spoken out in favour of artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be subjected to a " double urning " even the death of her husband would leave her desire to have children unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that in future a widow dow can be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
Until now, artificial insemination in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot have children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation payment for the climate: Calls for flight tax for universities get louder
There is a lot of flying at the universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future. The rectors say that they have no money for it. But now they are also coming under internal pressure.
Universities should also restrict themselves to flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion about a climate levy on flights from universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break is gaining momentum again. After the State Rectors' Conference had reacted epepabout a a advance from the green-black coalition,, the plans now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students from six Baden-Baden universities universities and a agogical university plead for compensation for service flights. This is " urgently needed " as a first step, at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, according to its statement. Meanwhile, the cabinet decision originally planned for July is still on hold, because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the secret service FSB, the detainees fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had already been arrested. At that time there was an exchange of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, and North Korean fishermen have travelling in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard claims to be patrorolling to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squid seized
During the new inspections, 30,000 ocid were discovered and confiscon on the boats. Furthermore, according the information, three fishing and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nakhodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's fishing authority had not issued fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to the media,, thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fishing Enterprises in the Far Eastern Region of Primorsky, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage from North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also take small organisms out of of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed.
In the future only 18,000: USA lowers asylum ceiling
The " most generous nation in history ": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officers in the White House.
The richest country in the world is closing itself off from those seeking protection: As the State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be further lowered. In the,, threatened and Iraqis in particular are to be given asylum.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the US State Department explained. In the now almost past marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump's administration has drastically reduced the readiness for people seeking protection from all the world in recent years. Under Barack Obama's previous government, far higher reception limits had applied.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was introduced in 1980. Nevertheless, the State Department called the US " " the most mertiful and generous nation in history, " a phrase phrase strongly reminiscent of language usage of the incumbent US president.
A " responsible handling " of refugees is aimed at enabling the refugees to return to their home countries to help with rereconstruction, Trump explained. He receives a lot of support from supporters for his hard line in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to close. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed a national emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selensky affair and a possible impending impeachment proceedings.
According to the Foreign Office, the US government wants to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees in the future: people who are being persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, according to the State's statement statement. On other hand, a maximum of 500 refugees refugees are to be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The US wants people from this " northern triangle " of Central America in particular to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has first concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration on the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires zoo a great apes sanctuary in the USA at the request of the Argentine judiciary. Born in 1986 at Rostock Zoo, " Sandra, " was granted the rights of a " non-human person, " so her release was mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human girl is unable to adapt to life in the the wild, she to live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees are already housed there, among them " Bubbles, " formerly a pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, " Sandra " has to endure a quarantine of about antdays at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, " Sandra " spent several years in the the Ruhr Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of " Sand's " fundamental rights, which was initiated by animal rights activists in 2014, has contributed to the conversion of the Buenos Aires Zoo into an ec@-@ park. By 2023, research and education facility for the conservation of biodiversity is to be established there.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes

Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sporting goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profit. Net profit in the past quarter rose to 1.4 billion dollars (just under 1.3 billion euros), which is 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the Group announced on Tuesday.

Investors reacted happily to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer rose by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban for racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about professional football player Juan Jesus from AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. Brazil-born defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club club to take action. " @ officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. # NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am, " wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing for AS Rome since 2016.

Conflict between Iran and US: Ruhani speaks of end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
After his return from the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged offer from the US to lift sanctions. The United States had promised an end to all sanctions in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted his Iranian counterpart via Twitter: " Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on it so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no. "
Ruhani describes the events as follows: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting to take place. " And America says I am lifting the sanctions, " Ruhani added. The nature of the punitive measures that should be ended was debated. " And they clearly said we are lifting all sanctions. "
However, this move was not taken place in an acceptable,, crized Ruhani. In view of the current punitive measures measures and " " poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure, " no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier of this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The background was the Europeans' hope to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with with Russia Russia with Iran, This should to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons French President President manuel manuel Macron like Merkel, had expressed the hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of a catastrophe is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This increases concern about a catastrophe.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. Thursday, the earthquake with magnitude of 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions. Now, the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - among other other things, worn down by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which were registered in the center as refuges, have long since been expanded. It was not on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August that the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of Thursday's quake was in the Sea of Marmara in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometres, as the Afad protection authority protection announced. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu announced on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. TRT broadbroadaster showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some students cried, as could be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at one of earthquakes Under Under the Sea of Marmara a section of the so-called North Anatoliolian bance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake with a magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. In the earthquake on Thursday, it hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design continemergency plans, private individuals have packed so-called go-bags with everything they need, next next to front doors, and schools teach children to behave when the earth is obbles. It is unclear when the next big quake will come.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer collapsed.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On social networks, many users report panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than Tuesday's, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned of aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official data, the time of the quake is given as 1: 59 (local time). According to CNN Turkey, only a few minutes after the first earthquake, there was an aftershock, which was indicated with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday, an earthquake with a magnitude of 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt as far to Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Sea of Marmara west of the metropolis of millions, the civil protection agency Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan, too, was hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. This has made it more likely, he told CNN Türk. " These could be the signs of a major earthquake, " Ersoy told the transmitter. " Sooner or later the big earthquake will come. "
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake also caused great concerns in Istanbul. In Albania,, there had been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. The earth had also shook at Lake Constance this year.

McEwan was quoted as saying, " If parliament parliament is closed so so the government cannot be challenged at at a critical moment, ministers lie shamelessly as the the Soviet leaders once did, when Brexiteers in high positions implore the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it write. " McEwan had only published the novel " Machines like Me " about artificial intelligence in the spring.
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself " transformed into a tremendous vermin, " is gradually excluded from family and society and finally perishes. " Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands upupside, " Diogenes Verlag said.

Stalling Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated himself: he will certainly not be a a third postponof the Brexit negotiations.. But what statements are of eternal lasting with the polarizing British. The recent ruling of the British Supreme Court hovering like a sword of Damocles over the head of blond. His suspension of the parliament to stustubnnly carry out his Brexit course by the departure date was annulled earlier this week. And a law passed by parliament obliges Johnson to extend of the bilateral talks until October 31 in the event of failed negotiations with the EU. However, Johnson had categorically repeatedly ruled out this.
Boris Johnson considers deal is still possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass noticeably by Johnson either. Meanwhile, while visiting a hospital, he made hinted that if if was was, he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we will abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And preferably with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is gradually running out of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have about six weeks to prevent the UK from leaving the European Union without an agreement. However, the recent talks have again not achieved a breakthrough. An agreement by the end end October October seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a renewed postponement of the withdrawal date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Prime. It fears fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.

" Today, Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, whom critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass rallies with one million participants in central places in the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence has already be observed. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in recent days the the had had steppup their street controls and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians partly for news and photos in connection with the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansursurwith hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them had been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were " in the wrong place at the wrong time, " HRW announced, citing lawyers those detainees.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country.

" He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades. "
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 Euro for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: That seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. Although the bill with 80 euros tip included was paid by the two women, they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
" Such cases damage the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud, " demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the Association of travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily newspaper Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant came promptly. The Japanese had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not inferred from the bill. Also, a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, said the innkeeper.
A call to Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump may indeed face impeachment proceedings after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats now want to examine their House investigation as soon as possible - we are talking of weeks until a decision is taken.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The accusation of the whistleblower, who ultimately made the conversation to the public with his complaint of concern for national security security and US democracy, is monstrous us the president has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country to influence the 2020 election. He had blackmailingly exploited Ukraine's dependence and thus forcing it to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be seen in the now published transcript of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not reflect the full wording. However, the phone call of July 25 is only one episode of a much larger story, in the center of which, alongside Trump, primarily his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public point of view view, story begins in May 2019,, when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani's plans to to Ukraine. He wants to meet with newly elected President Selensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. " We are not interfere in an election, we are fere in an investigation into what we have the right to do, " he tells the newspaper. One might think it inappropriate appropriate, but " there nothing illegal with that. " Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine for which there is hardly little basis - " because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could prove helpful to my government. "
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said the the time to construct an occasion for the Russia Russia investigation in the US., this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk so prominently on on the phone with ensensin in July. Giuliani and the president's version: ForForvice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential presidential diddidacy, Joe Biden, as Ukraine representative of the Obama administration, had ged for the dismissal of then-Ukrainian Attorney General VikViktor okin, in order to stop the investigation into into the gas company on whose superof board his son Hunter Biden served. Biden senior had blackmailed Ukraine financially to cover up his family's corrupt machinations.
In fact, the procedure was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General must leave, the investigation against the gas company had already completed completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin himself was also accused of deeply corrupt behavior, the US government was by far means the only Western partner who pushed for his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.

Attention: NEVER charge your smartphone wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technique via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come on the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models - we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommendable.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat generation. If a mobile phone is charged normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. When wireless elessly on other hand, the researchers have always measured above 30 degrees even when the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad also increases, which in turn increases the power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role here. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but it also does not last so long overall. Thus, the service life is smaller. Therefore, the researchers advise to always charging the smartphone by cable. Since a battery replacement is always associated with high costs modern modern, this should should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the costs of a battery replacement - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable clutter and tedious bubuding. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) is a a worldwide standard, in which exceptionally even Apple participates, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest traffic jam photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber has have climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within only six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition operator announced.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project " Mission Possible. " He has already made international headlines: He takes a photo of climbers standing queuing on Mount Everest that went viral in the spring.
The picture of the mass crowush triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848-meter-high mountain and highest peak on earth. In May, eleven climbers had died during the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking Xixabangma Mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China to enable it to climb.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman announced on Friday. " We suspect that the elephant were poisoned. "
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous former rock fortress Sigiriya,, visited by many tourists. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously kept themselves harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants every year, usually when the animals wrate through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants still live in Sri Lanka. Theoretically, their killing is punishby the death.

According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of colorectal cancer
The role of genes in the family ally increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. This is the conclusion reached by researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family al eating habits therefore probably weigh more heavily than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual colorectal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk increases Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) from the industry blog " Electrek. " Demand was strong, so Tesla could record 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customers. To do this TesTesla must muster as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares left trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 36,000 to 400,000 cars. To do this, six-digit figures are required in the current and coming quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been been losses.
Will British government circumvent Brexit law? Johnson reluctously
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hidden on whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the most recently against against ununBrexit Brexit passed by Parliament. When response to a question, he merely said journalists on Friday that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a " surrender law " that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that postpone the entry into force of the law until the period after leaving the EU.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is reach an agreement. "
Iran apparently booup uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on the European contracparties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. " Unfortunately, the European states show ininor unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions, " Rouhani said on Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. In case they did not stand by their promises, he promised out " further steps " away from the agreements of the painstakingly negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bombom,, which in return included a commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US withdrew the agreement on its its own in 2018 to force Iran to change course in the Middle East policy, aggressive aggressive aggressive as with " maximum pressure. " President Donald Trump's administration wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now relying on harsh sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently responded by resrevistarting the uranium richrichment limited in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium or has least least prepared them for use. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to set up more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to bear their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of pressing US sanctions, Rouhani suspected. However, there would still be further talks that would hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the mixture changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the Great Kingdom the the assessment assessment Monday Monday that hran was responsible for the attack attack. Originally, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had committed themselves for the attack, but was was regarded by US as a false confession. " We have nothing to do with it, " Rouhani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
" Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this, " Rouhani said. However, European leaders could could not do that in the talks with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they would only only invoked that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the US administration's far-reaching sanctions must first be lifted, Rouhani demanded. He called on the administration in Washington to shift to a policy of " dialogue and reason. "
Comet of another star crossed solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This has been achieved before before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was chstened 2I / Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The well-travelled comet was discovered on 30 August by amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-made telescope 65 centimetres in diameter. Follow-up observations by various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not originate from our solar system.
After 1I /' Oumuamua of 2017, 2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be sighted during a passage of our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get up close insights into a foreign solar system before it disappears on seeing again. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Asthysihysical Institute of the Canary Islands. " The current velocity of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which at this distance is well above the typical velocities of objects orbiting the Sun, " Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency Nasa reported in a statement.
According to the analyses, the comet is on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, interinterstellar tail star, which was initially listed the catalogue catalogue number C / 2019 Q4, was given the designation 2/ / Borisov,, the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I /' Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted on approach. Thus, the researchers have many months to investigate. " The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020, " explained Farnocchia. " After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020. "
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterization of 1I /' Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometers in a initial investigation. Images from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the astrophysical Institute of the the Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical chemical composition. " The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates its composition must be similar, " reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could be formed formed processes similar as as our ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors in just two years indicates that these objects could open up a new way of researching certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to predict how frequent such visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission by the European space agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency plans to station the three-part spacecraft " Comet Interceptor " (comet interceptor) at a waiting position a distance of 1.5 kilometres from Earth. According According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, will will either lurk for a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor such as 1I /' Oumuamua.
First landing at Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People's Republic of a first passenger aircraft of China United aircraft has landed at the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honour for the captain and crew.
By 2022, the new airport is expected handle around 45 million million passengers per year, with 72 million by 2025. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion project. China's latest prestige project is also called " starfish " because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subsubway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
During the construction, the Chinese had already announced several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. So, the opening of the capital airport in Germany, which which has been under construction - and and 2006 2006, has been repeatedly postponed. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger plane landed after only four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: from London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - that is what the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams of. This supersonic was targeted for the the 2030s, is supposed to be made made possible by a special Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine (Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US caster aster CNN quoted the agency. " This is the technology that could definitely achieve this, " agency manager Graham Turnock ck told the station. " We're talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced. "
In order to drive the project forward, the British space agency intends to work more closely with the Australian one. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to,, Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until the closure of operations in 2003 and took three to three and a half hours to do so. In 2000, an accident occurred occurred the launch of a a Concorde at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, in which all 109 occupants were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft, the " X-Plane " " together with US space agency Nasa. Virgin Galactic also has such developments in its programme.
" Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport, " writes Reaction Engines on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the " next generation of truly reusable frame travel equipment. "
Riot in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
" I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information, " Trump told employees of the US embassy to the United Nations in New York on Thursday. The person concerned is almost " a spy " and such had been dealt with " a bit differently " in the than they is today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate against tipmakers. Actually, the event was not public. However, several US media distributed audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president's testimony.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced preparations for impeachment proceedings against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations are based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who makes serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. Under great public pressure, the whistleblower's accounts were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received information from several government officials that the US president is " using the power of his office " to get another country interfere in his favor in the 2020 US election.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in late July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden, on the earlier business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is in the race for the Democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up in view of the Ukraine phone call: Leading government staff had tried to keep the exact text version of the conversation under the blanket. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been drawn up. However, after the conversation, had been removed from a usually intended database on the instructions of lawyers from the White House and instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was an employee of the CIA.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the " so-called whistleblower " had disseminated second-hand information that proved to be incorrect. so there may be no tippers or spies at all.
However, how Trump said in New York about those who allegedly leaked information to the whistleblower spoused outrage. US House Chairman Nancy Pelosi was anxiedly, complaining that Trump's testimony once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his entourage have been underway in various committees for months. In view of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pushing ahead with investigations with renewed force in order to initiate a possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
" The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation, " said the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accusing him of misrepresenting things, and again demanding the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insults Schiff and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US security and foreign-policy officials, most of whom worked among Democratic but Republican presidents, backed the Democrats-launched investigation for possible impeachment in a statement on Friday. If the allegations materitrue, it would be " an unscrupulous abuse of power " by Trump, it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could initia so-called impeachment ment procedure, but the decision to actual impeach would be in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects of success of such a procedure are slim. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
VW Works Council: Jobs are being " gradually gradually "
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the works council of the car manufacturer. The The wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023. of which 500 million euros are to be saved already this year.
One key to this is personnel costs. The " Future pact " negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the loss of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basiprinciple, a job can only be cut at the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, securing employment applies until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production, which are actually not up for disposal, are " stealth" reduced in another way - - other words, past the official course. Thus, regular vacvaccies would often not be refilled.
In these cases, the works council had no possibility to forcing the reoccupation. Meanwhile, there is a lack of staff in many places, the consolidation of work increasing,, the concerns about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants be greater. Thus, the fear also grows that the vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper favourable in other parts of the world. VW only said: " An adjustment of the employment of employment takes place as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve. "
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more worldwide and manage new projects centrally. This, too, is aims to costs costs also accelerate decisions - behind this is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Production Director Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: " Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof. "
In this way, there are already successes: This year, for example, for first first since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is is be presented on on 24 October in Wolfs,, be be tened by 1.1 hours. VW does not give exact figures on the production time, according to information from our newspaper, it is around the Golf 7.
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. VW VW the internal rule of thumb applies to Wolfsburg that 800,000 cars must be built there every year in order for the plant to be satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling demand for diesel and and the problems with changeover to the new consumption and exhaust gas test procedure WLTP.
However, as Production Director Tostmann announced last year, one million cars are to roll off the production line in Wolfsburg " in the future. " This is intended to make it possible to bundle golf production at the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is handover golf production by converting it into a location for e-car production.
In addition, the Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) SUV are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations are now rest on the Gulf 8. Despite all efforts to build e-mobility, it is to remain the bread-and-butter car of the Wolfsburgers for the time being.

Six suspected traffickers ers from Nigeria were sentenced to suspended and prison sentences of up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The defendants had smugled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into stitution.

The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean in inflhboats with the help of Libyan smugglers. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. Once arrived in Germany, they were distributed to different brothels in order to pay the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25,000 euros. Therefore, the wages was completely taken away from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the inmugation and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women among brothels in the trial. " The work made physically and mentally difficult for the women, " said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. " Some were really disgusted. "
The judgments refer to commercial and band-like smuggling of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and serious forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendant union Ufo has again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will " inform about the industrial action measures in the LH Group on 14 October, " UFO collective bargaining officer Daniel Flohr announced on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with the UFO for months. This concerns the question of whether the union has lawfully terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
Following a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court, Ufo now sees itself strengthened on this point. Lufthansa wanted to find it clear that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examining appealing against it. " I think it is unlikely that a second court will see the matter different differently, " said Ufo Executive member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application with the Frankfurt Regional Labour Court to have the status of the UFO as a trade union reviewed by the court. The company argues that the union has not appointed a representative board of directors for months and is therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the union, in the course of which numerous members of the board as as as the the advisory board resigned including including long-time union leader leader Nicoley Baublies. Because of the doubts about its leadership, the FO FO had an already begun begun vote stristrikes the cabin personnel at Eurowings at the end of July.

Half of Europe's tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also the causes of the threat, reported International International Union for Conservation of Nature IUIUCN in Brussels on Friday.. It the the of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of these do not occur occur any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of angerment and thus before extinction.
The IUCN classides endangered species into six categories: from " potentially endangered " to " endangered, " " endangered, " " threatened with extinction " and " extinct in " " to " extinct. " Overall it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
rowan and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, rowans (Sorbus) are particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. " Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats. "
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered " endangered " since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan miner moth in addition to a fungus. It has been spreading from southeastern Europe throughout the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 specimens. Not considered in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Shrb species and mosses also in danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists compiled new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than one fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
" This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet, " said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. " We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority. "

The creditors of bonds would have to accept depreciation of £900 million to £1 billion and the lenders would to between £550 million and 825 million. The actual amounts dedepreciation are likely to be at the upper end of the bandgins, an expert told the paper.
How large the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end will become apparent after the end of the insolvency proceedings. A person close to this proceedings did not radiate too much hope. For example, approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in Great Britain are " old " and many of the properties are in bad locations.

US warns federal government of Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great, " Pai told " Handelsblatt " with view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a " national security law " that obliges every company " under Chinese jurisdiction " to follow the instructions of the security authorities.
Current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties of such requests, " the FCC CEO continued, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to demand a " declaration of truworworthiness " from suppliers.
Berlin first wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the " Handelsblatt, " citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date, which consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, " said Pai.
It is " very hard to imagine " that a government agency, " no matter where, would be able to review every single update in real time to detect security risks, " the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts to the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership relations is opaque. the employee company that allegedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government, " Pai told " Handelsblatt. "
The US had findings that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the US position.
Chemical factory in Northern France burns: Schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic wall of fire illuminates the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleanup work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday as a precaution, the responsible prefecture announced. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to expose themselves to smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop harvesting for the time being.

Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson evdges question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticizes the " surrender law " passed by Parliament.
Parliament Parliament back, a a law requires the British prime minister to avoid chaos Brexit. Critics,,, fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Asked about this possibility, however, the Tory politician evades.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hidden on whether he wants to impose an unregulated Brexit - despite the recent law passed by Parliament, which should prevent exactly that. When response to a question, Johnson merely told journalists that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a " surrender law " that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.

The Prime minister could use a procedural trick that postpone the entry into force of the law until the period the exit the EU. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is to reach an agreement. "
Johnson's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said that he saw the political disputes over Brexit as a " walk in the park " and was confident that the desired exit from the EU would still come about: " We enjoy that, we will win, we will leave the EU editor's note), no worry, " Cummings said according to the British newspaper " Telegraph " at a book launch.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign " Vote Leave " during the campaign leading up to the 2016 EU referendum, now acts as chief strategist at the British headquarters of Downing Street. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policies that have led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.

They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. " She wanted real moments, " writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course, one is always the focus: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen him before.
He dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, calls in his bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears misshapen moon boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they they led a normal life beyond the headlight on their farm in southern England or Scotland. According to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And it was not always tidy with the McCartneys.
The Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment like hardly any other medium. Linda McCartney's shots are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decide click: you have to recognize if a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to take it at exactly the right moment, " said Paul McCartney. " If you take two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo. " And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing exactly the right moment. " She just knew she had it, " Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the frame and the colors are right, which not only makes makes The PolPolid id Diaries " entertaining taining book for Beatles fans, but but in addition to the anecdotal also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also look like abstract paint. The perfect complement to the recently re-released Beatles album " Abbey Road, " which was released exactly 50 years ago.
" We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran "
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighboring country despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, " said Erdogan in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had " withdrawn because of US threats. "
Nevertheless, Turkey will " continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and many other issues, " said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its withdrawal from the international nuclear deal with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of " maximum pressure " against the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not abide by the deal.
Their sanctions have led to the slump in Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. Tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably in recent months.
US government wants to restrict reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the US State Department declared that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, representing a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said that while the US would remain committed to supporting refugees, the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overloaded.

The program, launched in 1980 selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettled them in the US The The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the. Already Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When US President Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was just under 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted in horror to the announced lowering of the upper limit. " This is a very sad day for America, " said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would further damage its leadership role role in protecting the vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US - both legally as well as illegally. to it, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.

Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork has risen from a small startup to a driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear for billions in revenues.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to upset the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. A few days ago, the company had removed founder Adam Neumann as CEO, postponed the planned IPO and started the sale of subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for executives in order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British " Financial Times, among others, that WeWork has stopped stopped conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect. Thus Thus, largest tentenant office space is suddenly off the market in New York York and London among other places.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and leents it out to members at short notice in partly small units. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has ns money at a breathtaking speed with this business. Last year, the company made a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs are said to have risen to an estimated 2.5 billion billion dollars by renting ever large areas. To limit limit the loss, the new corporate management is said to have pulled the emergency brake brake and stopped renting new space with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with maturities of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion, which could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented ased almost 300Manhattan Manhattan one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, rented almost 300,000 square of office space over the past 24 months. WeWorks new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the space came onto the market during the time. Without WeWorks expansion, the office ancy ancy in the US metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in the " Business Insider. " The situation is similar in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in the best location.
In the British capital, too, the balance in the real estate market could noticnoticeably without without further expansion of aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis purchased last year by the savings banks fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the hoped-for billions in income. They do not have access to the - already scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term rental contracts. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually out by specially founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.

New climate protests of Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are likely to start due to the time difference before the protests extend across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How big the worldwide popularity this Friday will be after last week's record participation is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was in good spirits. " Last Friday, more than four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we'll do it again!, " she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6,383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
Especially in Germany, the influx was very high last Friday. According to estimates by Fridays for Future, a good third of all demonstrators worldwide - around 1.4 million - took part in the protests in 575 German cities. According to a list of the movement, rallies are planned this time in at least 65 cities, metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg sat down before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 in order to to on on her country's politicians to make greater commitment to climate protection. This This in the Fridays for Future emerged within within short short time. Pupils students in particular are participating in the climate protests, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politicians in the fight against global heating and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be contained to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived in New York less than a month ago after a two-week transatlantic trip on a deep-sea racing yacht, where she had recently taken part in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN in which she spoke forcefully in the conscience of the world of state state government of the. In In her native Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize by the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.

Those who smoke anyway, therefore expect expect a fine of rurubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should igna fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the ministry, the prohibition also includes burning candles. Even grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Strike against cybercriminals - Investigators lift servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time g ed a large server provider for illegal transactions on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as the operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach an der Moselle, through which international criminals operated their machinations.
This was announced by the Prosecutor General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been, among other things, the operators of the world's largest darknet marketmarketdrugs drugs, " Wall Street Market " - investigators smashed this in the spring. According to the secutor General's Office, the attack on 1.million telecTelekom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyberbunker.
Such a hoster was excavated for the first time in Germany, it was said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access operation with the support of special forces such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia and Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to take part in a major rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests ǀ Who are Thunberg's backers?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more astonishing that a 16-year-old girl of all people holds the mirror in front of the nose of the power people of that time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for her own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and gets young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win over a collection of children and young people. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a fairer world. At that time, he was also able to win win a crowd of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea to to reach the promised land, much GreGreta Thunberg recently went on a trip to America with a sailboat.
But is there a downside in this regard? Why does it take a share called " We don't have time " to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold extensively, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Also well-tested followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip by by boat was probably too thick for some successors. This is not unfounded, because the action came into its own well in the media worldwide and it flows a lot of money thanks to the imposing action.
Here the ghosts now de: Is it morally right to enrich oneself financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work work with stockbrokers during the world rescue campaign? No matter what what position is taken taken, critical and reflected point of view is increasingly increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy thrives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it may certainly make sense to critically question seemingly pious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
An foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system.
Astronomastronom' conjectures have been confirmed: a foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time, the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty that a comet from another star is currently crosses our solar system. It was named after its discoverer 2I / Borisov and currently emplos astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body in question was discovered an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov in the mea. He looked up at the sky with a self-made telescope and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is indeed an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to be sighted during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain close close insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the coming is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that leads it out of our system.
Comet was sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before that happens, astronomers can observe it in detail, unlike its predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in its approach, which means that it can be studied from Earth for many months. " The object will reach its highest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020, " explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa. " After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020. "
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 " Oumuamua. "
First findings on comet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the initial findings, the comet is estimated at a diameter of 2 to 16 kilometers. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years may allow a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again, asteroids empy the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid raced past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
" Absolutely reprehensible ": Rachel Johnson horrified by brother
It becomes lonely around Boris Johnson. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister cascourges the warlike language of the prime minister as " tasteless " with clear words. It is not the brother she knows.

" She considered this extremely reprehensible. She did not recognize her brother's version, said Rachel Johnsons, who had ran for the anti-Brexit party " Change UK " in the EU Parliament elections.
She was particularly ded with the the that that her mentioning Jo Cox, a pro-EU MP who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 withdrawal referendum. Their whose memory best best honored by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. " It is very tasteless to refer to a MP who was murdered by someone who shouted' Britain first', " now criticized Johnson's sister. The perpetrator had obviously come from the far-right camp, which feels " " by this kind of language. " For those who mourned her, it is very tasteless.
The widower of Cox also sharply criticized the prime minister. " It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like this, " he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to stand up passionately decisresolutely about what you believe in - no matter what you you are. But you must never " demonize the other side. " He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MP. " I've been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it's an indissoluble tension, " Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson's language also met with harsh criticism in the church. As the Times reported, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is " not worthy of this country. " In a joint statement, they declared: " In recent days, the language has been been acceptable, both in debates and outside parliament. We should speak to each other with respect. "

An actor and Youtuber adds Egypt's ruler: For the time being, however, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have an influence on whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt both spent abroad last week. One of them flofloback at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly Assembly ForEx-general who deposed posed Muslim Brotherhood Mohamed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, in 2013, had spent a pleasant time in New York: President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's actions against political Islam and did not lost a syllable about human rights violations on the Nile - in in a in which Egypt's security security forces arrested hundreds of people daring to protest against against the president. He " had no reason to worry, " Sisi said at the airport airport in the microphof state television. " The The Egyptians not be misled. "
Mislead - according to the president, this the other man who is currently domining what is happening on the streets is trying. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he eludes the grip of the security forces, who would arrest him immediately if tried tried to foot on Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafés living living rooms and tea rooms: with his YouTube channel " Mohammed's Secrets, " Ali calls on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in a quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president indindvin luxury and and magnificent new palaces aces be built, they says. Ali accuses the army leadership, which which isi bases his his rule of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with exactly these gentlemen for 15 years years in his second job as building contractor, he seems to know pretty well what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding click numbers show.
After thousands had demonstrated against his rule last week the first time since Sisi's grip grip on power and almost 2,000 citizens, including prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a " millions of dollar ch " for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would really venture into the streets. However, there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giza near Cairo and in the town of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also used used tear gas rubber bullets. At first, these these videos could not be veriverified. Security circles said that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators tore banners with the portrait of the president to pieces last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the arterial roads. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed for " maintenance work, " most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And in Rabaa Square Square, where supporters the overthrown Muslim Brothertherhood Morsi entrenched in 2013 2013 until the army took them under fire and killed to 800 people, another measure was intended to prevent discontented people from gathering: Sisi's future party wanted to hold a large-scale rally for president here here.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: " Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square, " Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. " Let's not collilash with police officers. " But this is not to be understood as a retreat: " All of Egypt is Tahrir Square. "
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options.
If you conclude an Internet contract, you do not need to blindly trust the speed information of the providers. Customers can check themselves in the event of abnormalities how much of it is actually achieved.
After all, the previously promised transfer rates are an part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the consumer Association Bavaria.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. The measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
" However, the tests of the providers are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively, " points out the consumer association Bavaria on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised service. Affected affected do this best in writing by entry letter.
If this does not work even after several requests, customers can terminate and possibly also claim damages. However, in the absence of success, only the method of action will help.

Allegedly, Jaqueline Ng had been assured an upgrade by mail by Cathay Pacific. However, when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed to board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously getting an upgrade for Business Class - many passengers dream of that. Sometimes they are lucky and the check-in staff offer a change from Economy Class free of charge.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. More than 65,000 users follow Jaqueline Ng on Instagram. She 30 May she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on 7 June.
On the outward flight, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although she had shown an e-mail in which Cathay allegedly promised ing her an upgrade. The influer allealleto have received the letter from an airline marketing representative, while the airline accuses Jaqueline of siging the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at the airport JFK were sceptical: They checked the headquarters. And indeed, the employee from whom the mail allegedly originated denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed the mail system, in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (around 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new flight tick to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her for the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: the influencer has committed fraud for Cathay, she remains blocked for future flights. Furthermore, the airline's terms and conditions state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now hires a lawyer.

Doping: Further Russian manipulations proven
Material from the Moscow analytical laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and current head of integrity of the World Athletics Federation.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details about the doping scandal in Russia come to light - and they are destroying the little credibility that Russian sport had regat the beginning of the year and even even to some extent In In 2019,, the Moscow Doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport was exposed. Thereupon, the Wada had blocked the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes from the country compete under a neutral flag, at the Winter Games in February 2018 168 Russian athletes were competing. They were also allowed to take part in the World Cups in the various sports, in the summer the Football World Cup took place in Russia with the host as participant.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples question. The data was intended to provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping, help help punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Federation in Athletics (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analytics laboratory have manipmanipulated. " Yes. received the data nine months ago. We should check whether whether the Force Force received the right data, " said David Howman in Friday's interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. " We have found numerous discrepancies between the data the Wada from a whistleblower and those it received from the Russians in January. " Many positive findings mentioned in the McLaren report were missing.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Federation is the only organisation to hold on to spell of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes will compete under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already raised manipulations and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening to ban the Rusada again and, in the worst case, to exclusion them from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
