Puzzles solved: That's why we cannot tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people being to tickle themselves. Scientists of the Humboldt University in Berlin found this with the help of experiments on rats, as as they reported on Thursday evening. Pro, gress has also been made on the question of why children fight so violently against tickling, only only to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why the approaching of a tickling hand already causes laughter before the touch. This is due to a low lying layer in the cerebrum, which already causes laughter at the expectation of tickling.
According to data, previous research showed that rats react with " laughter in the ultrasound region when they are tickled by people. This " laughter " is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch
So far it been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - so therefore people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now out in the the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-contact. This is also the case when living beings clean themselves themselves. During the foreign contact and tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh has been increased.
But if the self-touch and the contact of others occur at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This This indicates that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between the self-touch and the touch touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves, because self-touch activates a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Thus, they broke this initiation in the experiment thus sometimes prematurely, showed escape behavior or scarght of fear. This ambivalence similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is equal in rats and humans.

Iran relerelease British tankers
The UN general debate brought no solution to the conflict in Iran. But now there is one problem less. The British oil tanker Stena Impero " detained in in Iran, could set sail again. It could could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " been in detained the the the of muus in in Iran since mid-July is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The " Stena Impero " had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai, other things for medical examinations, said director Erik Hååell ell. Around noon, the ship left the Iranian waters. " Nice nice that it is over, " he told the Swedish TV station SVT.
The Foreign Ministry in London described the fixing of the ship as illegal " This is part of a pattern of attempts to compromise the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping shipping and international law, " said a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard ards set the tanker on 19 July on charges of having having ating the the rules of the Sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The the remaining 16 crew members were doing well according with the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaprofessionally ally to the difficult and risting situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them back with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected the fixing of the " Stena Impero " a reaction to a similar incident in British British: At the beginning of July, a super tanker with oil from Iran, allegedly intended for Syria, had was put to chain. According to the authorities, the delivery violated against EU sanctions against the warof war Syria. The British had received the reference of the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of " piracy " and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the " Adrian Darya-1 " was finally released. Conjjons that it was a barter ter to to release the " Stena Impero, " London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the worldwide oil export is shipped by the Strait. The tensions in the region had intensified immensely over in recent months. Merchant shipping was drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tension between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of trying to build nuclear weapons, Iran rejects this. The US had alone withfrom the international international nuclear agreement in, which which should prevent Iran from building a atomnuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then the US government has pressured the leadership in Threrunder under pressure with economic economic against against the country to force force a more and agreement extended to to other areas. so far far resiststood the pressure.
Due of the dispute over the " Stena Impero " and other events with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had presented at the UN General Assembly in New York a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz. the initiative " Coalition of Hope " for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protective powers to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would be predestined a " war profiter. " Given the punitive tariffs that America's President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers are forced forced to rein the People's Republic. Financers of Asian companies who considering relocating their production from from China another another, call India as one of the preferred alternatives in a survey by UBS BS., of course has not only to do with the imponderables of the Sino-American trade war. With with a huge pool of young workers as and a internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems be created to play a more important role in the globally widely diversified production chain.
But India India has come into Trump's focus. Disjoratory by the White House warbrand as the " kingdom of tariffs, " America withthe emerging country's benefits for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The US accuses India prohibitively high tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the friction with India are only a siside le. Moreover, America America considers the world's largest democracy also through through security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combines the concern about China claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this backdrop, a salley of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just started a second five-year term, should therefore weiull in safe.
The problem is however in another place: The empirically cally borated thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult situation in the socialist republic of India. Even under Modi. His enthusiasm for reform aims mainly at the bureaucratic insanity, which sufftherated any entrepreneurial spirit too too long in the multi-ethnic state. Companies now receive more er building permits permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more effective insolvency and bankruptcy law creates prerequisconditions for more rapidly ididliquididapparently apparently dead companies with high debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From economic optics, much has turned for the better in India in the first five modes modes years. However, this does not apply in trade policy. It is animated to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national-conservative government even set up new barriers.
In the West, Modi the the auof of energeenergereformer, which radically eehis country economically. This impression is due not due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well which vocabulary ary of Western managers. At the core, the " India First " advocate never moved drawn from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian Indian from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus thus fit for for global.. Businessmen who survive thanks to the foreclosure off of their industries, are among the regular voters ters MoModis nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applauthis short-sighted politics.

Brexit debate is like a " walk in the park "
The violent verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament, the according to his top advisor, not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a " stroll in the park, " Dominic Cummings said Friday Friday a book presentation on Friday.

Pakistan Prime Minister Khan Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan at his first appearance before the UN General Assembly, again called on the United Nations to act in the Kashmir conflict.

Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government reacts against the current protests in Egypt with a hard hand. It shoowith live ammunition on the population, more than 2000 arrested sts join in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who already detained there. Protesting has never been been dangerous in Egypt. But since since the rise to power of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything to avoid a scenario like as in the Arab Spring.
But one of the trigger ers for the 2011 protests was the bad economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by the own government, drove millions into the streets. And this is a problem that even the regime of el-Sisi cannot get a control, no matter how hard it is against against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today one third three in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must must decide who he financed: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only only for the suppression but but also the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even didima in the supermarket supermarket an old one. It It becomes critical when large parts of the population have have having afford to afford a bottle of water.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER boss: No more " showstoppers " for capital city airport
Two months were been checked whether the complicated braesh of plants works with BER fire protection works in play. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv inspects in the terminal of the future capital capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said supervisory board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control committee.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there are still defects to be handled in the terminal. " We have many detailed topics, but we do not have a real showstopper. " He assured that the timetable until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indicthat the the time reserve should no longer be too large. The building indication is should now be submitted to the construction Office the course of the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year that was scheduled for this autumn.
Hundreds of defects in of cables are still to be fixed; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. " In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operation, work must continue to be intensively on deal process the shortienings, " it said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all dowels on which the cable channels are hanging. The airport chief expects this to be by the end of the year.
In, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not satisfactorily. The problems had led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons that shut down down in a fire like a screen, so that the smoke does not spread out. They drive down too far. 36 engines therefore have to be replaced. Then there should be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects well as planning errors have delay the opening of the airport for years. Originally it was was to go into operation in 2011. The costs have increased from two billion since the construction of in 2006 to presumably around 6.5 billion euros at the opening next year.
Because the passenger numbers in Berlin have risen significantly since then, the responsible responsible are planning the expand the airport. This is therefore the focus of in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on October October, as the Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now for two new managing directors. Financial Officer Heike Fölster will change to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, personnel manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanFölster. She had put the airport finances on firm feet.

In the midst of the price war with low cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over " the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna, " on Friday a press spokesof Austrian Airlines Airlines to the APA. Previously, " AviationNetOnline " reported on it.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low cost airline Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft four four in Vienna. The AUA will take over these from January 2020 in the " Wetlease, " including Eurowings personnel. In future three Eurowings jets will be be stationed in Salzburg, which are to fly from Salzburg Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. Lines from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning,, the spokesman. The flight times are to be adapted to connecting flights. On one one hand one is is to strengthen the Vienna hub and on the other other, to expand decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a " production Company " for the Group sister AUA. For other things, Barcelona and Rome served with AUA flight number, but mainly operated with Eurowings device. Although the on-board product to be adapted to the one of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants are originate from Eurowings. Eurowings flights deparstarted under AUA flight number, according according to the report are no longer handled handled in Terminal 1, but rather as as the AUA in Terminal 3.
A price war has broken out at Vienna Airport after NikNikbankruptcy. The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced only on Thursday, the increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airline will send four Ryanair machines with crews to Vienna, also in the so-called " wetlease, " which the union criticized as a bypass design to the collective contract.
The battle of announcement of Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years years, replied on Friday, AUAU's board member Andreas Otto: " We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years. "

Study on the causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really causes a a sufficifailure or an infarcction? Resin Hamburg want to take a look at the genetic ome of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genetic ome of 9,000 people, Hamburg gers and Swiss scientists want to identify the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. The Kühne Foundation Foundation is the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the High Mountain Clinic Davos, which is owned to the Foundation and the University Hospital of Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are one of the essential influsionable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. But the interinteraction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic ome of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes show possible disease-causing changes changes the DNA - so-called mutations are known, was said by the clinic. About 200 are added every year.
The aim of the five-year project is according to the initiators to develop new options for the precau, detection and and treatment of ac arrhythmas,, sufficiness and heart attacks. The data could also be used in the research of other common diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as as cancer diseases are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphaout that there was the firm will to use the data to research into other diseases. The clinof the foundation in Davos so so far primarily primarily with allergies. Now, on the medical ampthere, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine and a professorship ship bioinformatics will be created. In the fication of his commitment, the logistics logistics logistics based based in Switzerland said that he had operated open-open heart three years ago and ago and and very grateful.
The bisamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the " Hamburg City Health Study. " With 45,000 test persons, according to the hospital ic this is the largest local health study in the. During the genetic genetic rypcoding, DNA is strictly attention to the protection of anonyymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the genetic ome of human can be decicoded within 24 hours.. The pure material costs for this are 1300 euros. The first gene gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, had still cost several hundred million euros. The study is to begin on 1 October, and all 9000 samples will be analyzed sed by the end of 2020. In year year, first results are expected.

Football " Signature not valid "
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa honishes the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football baller election, accations ations from other countries from other FIFA. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious fication.
Much at FIFA has proven proven be reputable in recent years: the World Cup awarding, dubious plans of their president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt functionaries However, the FIFA FIFA world football football election has so far not come into suspicpicof of running uncly - - with the being that the voting national coaches and national team capcaptains the member associations often vote vote after sympathy than according to objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now apparent: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not not up in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
The FIFA apologizes itself in the extent that " the signatures on the voting forms were been in in capital letters and were therefore not valid. " They contcontacted the Egyptian association several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan's trainer also amazed
There is also an an outcry regarding the election. While the situation is the case in Egypt case is understandable, the Sudanese association states fies that trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not voted as it was finally finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi in place place, Virgil van Dijk on two Sadio Mané on three. According According to Fi, however, the vote was just received received, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Acclegations also raised Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera: " Did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my vote are wrong, thank you, " he wrote. In his case it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his name.
The association came the message Friday on Friday: True, but of course was no intention. The completed electoral documents were " erroneenly " " with the name and the signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was said in a message from the association association. but, actually, the second captain Manuel Rosas. " We take the responsibility for the administrative error, " it said in the message. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte would voted in favour of Messi, " just as as it is in the list of FIFA. "
The other cases are now Fifa examined in an investigation, but emphasizes that the electoral process was externally supervised by the consultancy company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long, Lionel Messi remains only an undisputed winner of the world footballer election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: Rranking Republicans cans in favour of official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly for an official investigation against the US president and party-ist Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, " said Republican Governor of the US state of Vermont, Phil Scott. " Where ever this leads from here, is determined by the facts that are determined. " He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action are taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the president's removal.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump repeatedly repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a telephone call to investigate the activities of the presidential presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has observed Biden " for years. "
The Republicans have far back with cricriticism of Trump about the whistleblower affair, few have have apparent uncomfort about it. Scott's statements are now now first sign of this in Trump's party, Yet the moderate governor of Virginia has already several times times Trump Trump's,, such as the easing of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican can, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, spoke out for the investigation. " It is a deeply disturbing situation, " Baker said. " The right approach and responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it. "
Scott and Baker, governor of US states, have no no in in the case against Trump is decided in Congress. So their statements are therefore symbolically important. Nevertheless, first first Republican senators have also been criof the the situation. For example, MitRomney, who represents the state of of tah in the second House of parliament, said that the case is " extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing. " US media also report that first first cracraaps internally up Republicans.
The affair could result in the launch of an impeachment proceedings against Trump, the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, they accusing him abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no exact timetable for the peachment proceedings. With their majority in the House of, the Democrats could apply so-called impeachment. The decision on actual impeachment would made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The the prospects of success of such a procedure are low. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board raccket's " Sea Watch "?
Three men were arrested in Sicily, they are said to have raped and killed in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had headed the port of Lampedusa the " Sea Watch 3 and 53 Libyrefugees on board and 53 Libybian refugees on board without unpermission. After After ce protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was repeagain after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations against raccket are loud loud. Thus, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the " Sea-Watch 3. " The suspects have been caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily), after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. " We cannot rule de this, but even have no reliable information on, " said " Sea Watch " spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police were said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortortured and even murdered. The were concerns Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). " The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence, " was said at the time.
NGO and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming the the ships " We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports, " said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why the people flee from Libya. It it therefore quite quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. It is therefore very important that this is investigated. "
Italy's right-wing Interior Minister Minister Matteo Salvini demanded an an apology from Rackete, against is is still being investigated in Italy because subsiaid to illegal immigration.
Musk strifor delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given a boost to his electric car company with the prospect of new record figures on the stock market.
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, " Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla published by the industry blog " Electrek. "
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musks's newsletter circul.The challenge is to bring bring cars cars to customers customers. For Therefore TesTesla to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went trading with a increase of of over six percent. The price has not increased that strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This this have six digfigure figures in the current and next next of a year. Especially all the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom there were last losses.
US budget dispute: Once again only one bridge financing
The new fiscal year will begin in the US on October 1, without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided decided a transitional financing until November 21.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed on an increase the spending ceilings for the financial years of 2020 and 2021, the United States are once more without without spending plans before the new new fiscal year on October 1. The Senate followed the the House of Representatives on Thursday and and decided a transitional financing (Contining Resolution, CR) until November 21. Without such such a decision it would have been a shutdown at at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump must put the decision into force.
Shutdown averted
For the, the Federal administration is is financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019 ending on Monday. This, because the Congress has not agree agree in time on the 12 spending laws, which allocate the the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore Therefore the Federal Administration cannot benefit for the time from the expenditure framework framework for the new budget year from 1.3 trilli. to $1.4 trillion.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of, where they have the majority. However the the spending reflect priorities of the Democrats, who have little chances in the Republican-dominated Senate. Vice verssely, the Senate also has more or of of the twelve spending plans that are barely to a majority.
The minds differ primarily on the topic of resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are trying to force force 12 billion for the construction of the Wall, one of the great priorities of President Trump. The Democrats are ferbing with the wall construction plans and their financing, which is is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute about the construction of the was already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
The spirits on the from of the Wall
Currently is currently unclear how the parties want to get each closer on this issue. More probable than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond beyond 21 November. Also, a shutdown is not not excluded.
Against the background of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for for the automation of the process. Submit p. 1877 on the prevention of shutdowns, the financing of the federal administration would each continue continue at the previous year's level, inhibit the travel of the parliamentarians and hold their wages until the new annual spending plans are available.
France allows insemreproduction for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination should also be open to single living women and and ans in ans: The Paris National Assembly voted with a large majority favour of a proposed by the government according to which which all women can use of in vitro fertilization. Thus, the demand for anonymous sperm donation should increase significantly.
The proposal still requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right right camp warned that in the future numerous children without a father could grow could in the. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as a " opportunity " for society. It portrays the modern family in which there were children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs of artificial inszations for all are to be borne by social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm of dead husband continues husband
With a narrow majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that should give widows for artificial insemination access to their dead man's sperman. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination " post-mortem tem. " In Germany, there were been in the past, which women complained ain in ain for the release of the sperm of a deceased. The opponents of of the in in Paris argued that a witnessconceived child then carries a " particularly difficult fate. "
Numerous members of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic in Motion, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and MPates of the opposition had spoken in favour favour the artificial insemination with the sperm of the late partner. They emphasized that a widow dow is imposed a " double grief, " if the death of her husband remained the death of her also remained unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it it unfair that a widow may in future future to be be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot concany children. They must be married or live together for at least two two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrosurrogacy would continue to be forbidden.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - yet it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.

At that time there was an exchange of of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later died to his serious injuries. But this time there had were no injuries, it said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortage. The North Korean fishermen were therefore traveling in Russian territorial waters. According to its own,, 's Coast guard is driving patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
3.000 squid confiscated
During the renewed checks, 30,000 squids were discovered on the boats and confiscated. In addition, according to three three fishing and two motor boats were seized and brought to Nupodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's fisheries authority, even after lawsuits from local entrepreneurs, had not fishing licences to the North Koreans this year. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have have have already been temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region Primorye region, GeorMartynov, recently also complained high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-mesit synthetic networks forbidden in in. With these also small small creatures were be brought from the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply disposed ed in the sea where they would need 200 years to be decomposed.
In the future only 18,000: US: to asylum upper ceiling
The " most generous nation in history ": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officials in the White House.
The richest country in the world is closing off from those looking for protection: as the Ministry confirmed in Washington, the upper limit for the legal immigration of refugees will be further lowered. In the,, all angered believers and Iraqis are to receive asylum.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low border for the admission of new refugees again. In the marketing year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to allowed allowed into the country, as the US State Department explained. In the the almost past fiscal year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump's administration has drastically reduced the receptiveness for protection seekseeking from from around the world in recent years. Under Barack Obama's predecessor, there had were far higher were limits.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee program in 1980, but the State Department called the US as the most mercciful and generous nation in history, " a phrase strongly reminiscent of the language of the incumbent US president.
A " responsible approach " with refugees aims to ensure that the can return to their their home countries to help rethere there, Trump said. For his hard course in migration policy he receives a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of dispute is the border with Mexico which Trump wants to close.. To finance the construction of a border wall, Trump imposed the National of Emergency. Whether is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because the the Selensky affair and possibly impending impeachment proceedings.
According to the Foreign Office, the US government will wants to future on the admission of two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus come in danger, as shown from the from of State Department. However, a a maximum 1500 1500 refugees,, Salvador should El Salvador should be accepted.
The USA wants to ensure that people from this " northern triangle " of Central America apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background drop, the United States has concluded concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now with with Salvador and Honduras, in order to contain immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.

A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump may actually be facing an impeachment process in after the turbulent revelations of recent days, the Democrats now want to examine this with their investigation in House of Representatives as soon as possible - there is talk of weeks until a decision would made.
At the beginning of the scandal is allegedly the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The allegation of the whistleblower, who brought brought the out for concern for national security and the democracy of the USA with the complaint with his complaint,, is monstrous: the president had abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the 2020 election. He had had exploexploited Ukraine's dependence Ukraine extortortioningly and wanted to force it to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also be able in the now published trantranof the conversation with Selenkyi, although it does not reflect the full wording. However, the call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in the center center of Trump Trump above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public viewpoint in May 2019, when the New York reports of Rudy GiuliGiuli's's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected elected Selensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are thorcky. " We do not get ere in a choice, we interfere in an investigation, which we have the right, " he says to the newspaper. One might think that it is inappropriate, but " it is nothing illegal. " Giuliani wants wants investigations investigations investigations investigations be in Ukraine, for which there is hardly a basis - " because these information will be very, very helpful for my client and could prove to be helpful to my government. "
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump's counterval in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for the Russia investigation in the US. However this accusation never be taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that which Trump will so prominently on the phone with Selensky in July. GiuliGiuliGiuli's and the's version reads: The former former Vice president and currently promising spective candidate for the Democratic presidential nomacy, Joe Biden, had uras as Ukraine representative of the Obama Obama administration for the dismissal of the then Ukrainian Proutor General Viktor Schokin. In order to stop the investigation he him responsible the gas company in whose whose board board board his son Hunter Biden was active. Biden senior had blacktored Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine in in order to cover up the corrupt machinations of his family.
In fact, the process was slightly different. When Joe den demanded that the Ukrainian attorney General had to go, the investigation against the gas company had already already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Moreover Schokin was himself was accused of deeply corrupt conduct, the U.S. government was by no not the Western partner partner urged for dismissal. By cidentally, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation into the company.

Attention: smartphone NENever wirelessly
Practical, but but aging
Inductive technology via Qi-Standard is extremely practical, but should should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come on the market, which support wireless charging and and sell very well - above all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recrecall a study from the the beginning of July y.Although the wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature causes the battery battery
Researchers warn of wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of of the University of Warwick this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If charge charge a phone is charged by cable, the battery heats to 27 degrees within three hours. During wireless wireless charging, on the hand even with the alignment of the smartphone on the charging,, researchers always measured over 30 degrees. If the mobile phone is located slightly next to the coil, the temperature increases even higher. addition, the watattage of the charging pad increases increases, which in turn pusup up power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a decisive factor.. every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only loses on capacity, but it also not not last through so long long. So the the life is is lower. Therefore the researchers advise that always recharge the smartphone via cable. Since since a battery exchange is always associated with high high costs with modern smartphones, this probably be more helpful tip. Apple recently recently increased increased the costs of a battery exchange even again - - and that for all iPhones.
Practically
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a appropriate charging pad - these are are now already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels, and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable cable utter and tedidiplug plug melging. Since with Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) a worldwide standard is prevailed, which which exceptionally even Apple takes along, there are hardly restrictions..,, according to researchers the technology should be used only in exceptional cases.

The background is conflict conflict the international agreement to to an an Iranian nuclear bomb, which contained in return contained the promise to Tehran to normalize the economic relations. The US withwithfrom the agreement in 2018, in order to force Iran with " maximum pressure " to make a change course in the Middle East considered considered as Middle East policy.

" We have nothing to do with it, " Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
" Those who make such allegations must provide evidence of this, " Rouhanani. However, the European leaders have not done that in the talks with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they would have only reloked that the rebels in Yemen not carry out an attack like as one. Rohani had met in the days with with Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the depths of the universe. This was succeeded before. The comet can be conclusions about other solar systems.
What was initially just a gution is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was baptized after its explcoverto 2I / Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The widely travelled comet et was discovered on 30 by by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-made telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-up observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet but but showed that it did not not from our solar system.
2I / Borisov is after 1I /' Oumuamua from 2017, only the second interstellar object that which was seen during a flight through our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to gain insights into a foreign solar system from close before he disappears on never never again again. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries reported. " The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is at this distance significantly above the typical speeds of objects that orbit the sun, " reported for example Davide Farnocchia from the US space Agency Nasa in a message.
According to the analyses, the comet on a so-called hyperbel orbit that leads it from of our - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU).. It is also for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its explorer the interstellstelltail star, which had initially been under the the catalogue number C / 2019 Q4, received from it the ation 2I / Borisov, with the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: contrary to 1I /' Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been ted in approach approach Thus Thus the researchers have many months for investigations. " The object object reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and and then still be seen until April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes, " explained Farnocchia ia " " that that, it will only only be observed with larger, professional, professional telescopes. "
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. Thus a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had led the characterization of 1I /' Oumuamua, in a first investigation the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Images ordings of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers of the astrophysical Institute of the Canary aries (IAC) have already a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. " The spectrum of this object ressimilar to those of comets of our solar system, and this points out that its composition must be similar similar, " reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests suggests that comets in other solar solar systems could form formed similar similar to those those that in in ours, by de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within only two years,, to the the IAU, that these objects could open a new way to exploring certain processes in other solar systems. However, how how often such visits are are is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly cept a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency wants to station it on a waiting position at 1.5 million kilometers away Earth 2028 the the three-part space probe " Comet Interceptor " (comet intercepeptors. According to Esa science director Günther HasHasinger she should llk on a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or an interstellar visitor like 1I /' Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-airport Daxing
Just on time before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic has it time: the new new ega airport in the south of the Chinese capital a first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 45, about million passengers are will be handled at the new airport by 2022, by 2025 it is is already be be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China's most tige project in China is also called called " starfish " because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will be be expanded to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new new subway transports passengers passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had announced several times that Berlin can learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital capital airport in under 2006 - and much smaller - - under construction since 2006 has so so been been poned so again In Beijing, other hand, a first passenger plane landed in already after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: From London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of dreams the British space agency UK Space Agency. It is to to make this possible, aimed for the 202030s in the 2030s a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company develops Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US TV cCNN ququoted the agency. " This is the technology that could definitely accompliit this, " said agency Graham Turnock to the transmitter. " We are talking the 202030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced. "
To promote the project, the British space Agency wants to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from from 1976 until its its operation in 2003 and took took three to three and a half hours. In 2000 there was an accident during the takoff of a Concorde at the Charles de GauGaulle in,, in which all 109 occupants were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced announced announced plans, together with the US space agency NASA Nasa to develop a supersonic aircraft, the " X-Plane. Virgin Virgin Galactic also such such developments in program.
" Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport, " writes Reaction Engines, among others, on his homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside outside Earth's atmosphere, thus enabling the " next generation of truly reusable frame travel equipment. "
Riot in Washington: Trump wants to find anonymous tipiers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about possible possible abuse of power by US President, Donald Trump wants to detect possible leaky in the White House.
" I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information, " Trump said on Thursday to employees of the US embassy to the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost " a spy " and with such had handled " a bit different " in the past it is today.
This was interpreted as an attempt intimidation against tysters. The event was not actually public. However,, several US media distributed audio cuts of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted ougnged to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced preparations for an impeachachment suit against Tuesday. Their allegations are based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who raises serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. Following great public pressure, the accounts of the sistler had made published on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower will have received information from several government workers, that the US president " uses the power of his office " to ensure that another country interfere in the US election in his favor.
The center of the allegations is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to conduct investigations that could harm his political rival Joe Biden, dealing the previous business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and and ed efforts to protect his his offfrom the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is in the race to for the Democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower accused the White House with a view of the Ukraine telephone call of the cover-up: Leading government employees had tried to to keep the exact ding ding of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been made. However had was after after the on the instruction of lawyers from the White House House but was removed from a usually intended database and instead stored in a particularly protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistle is not publicly known. The " New York Times " reported that it should be an employee of the CIA foreign secret service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote among other things that the " so-called whistleblowers " had spread second-information that had turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, there may be no tipiers or spies.
As Trump spoke in New York about those alleporpordly information to the whistleblower, but caused ougnge. President of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, reacted worried and complained that Trump's statement once again underthe government's integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations been been under various Trump against Trump and his committees for months. In view of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pusforward an investigations with new force to start a possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
" The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation, " the head of the Intelligence Service Committee in the House of Representatives Adam Adam Schiff Trump attacked sharply, accused him of a misrepresentation of things and once again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly curults ship and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US officials from the security and foreign policy sphere, who worked mostly under democratic but also Republican presidents, backin a statement released published on Friday behind the investigation initiated by Democrats Democrats a possible impeachment proceedings. If the accallegations were true, it would be " " unrupululabuse of power " by Trump, it said.
There is no exact schedule able for further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives the Democrats could apply a so-called impeachment procedure, but the decision on actual impeachment would made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. the prospects prospects of success of such a procedure are low. So far, no US president has been reliefrom from office by an impeachment procedure.
VW works council: Workplaces are reduced " crecreously "
The plans of the brand to further reduce reduce costs in production could could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is is hes the works council of the car maker. The brand to reduce its its annual factory costs ten billion euros by by two billion euros by 2023. Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved already this year.
One key to this is personnel costs. The " future pact " negotiated between companies company the works council 2016 until 2020 already foresfor the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone. The principle the rule applies: a job can only be reduced by the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security applies until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production, which were not not at disposition, are reduced " creslowly " by another way - so passing the official course.. Thus, freant regular positions are often not refilled.
The works council has no possibility in these cases to force the reoccupation.. Meanwhile, personnel are missing in many places, the work action fication increasing, the concerns about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle works would be greater. Thus, there also the fear that the vehicle production could gradually be be withted from Germany and Europe, because it is more cheaper in other parts of the world. Of this only said said said said: " An adjustment of employment employment takes place as as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve. "
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more worldwide and control new projects centrally. This is is also to reduce costs and also to accelerate ated - - behind it is the goal of increasing productivity and thus the competitiveness. Chief Production Production Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: " Particin unceruncertain times from Brexit to the pending pending trade war between the and and China, we are well advised to make ourselves firm of the crisis. "
There are already successes in this way: For example, this year for the first time since 2013 the production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Before to, Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, which will be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 by 1.1 hours. VW does not provide any exact figures on production production,, according to to our newspaper, it is around Golf 7.
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant Wolfsplant is the only factory in which vehicles are produced. The The plants Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the's of internal b rule of thumb that 800,000 cars have to be built there each year so that the plant is satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, the utiliutiliin Wolfsburg was only only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining diesel demand and the problems with the the switch to the new consumption and exhaust gas test method WLTP.
As production Director Tostmann already announced last year, however " million cars " " " specspectively " " to roll off the assembly line in Wolfsburg. This is to make the bundling of the golf production in the main plant possible - because the Zwickau plant handthe golf production through the conversion to the location for e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have decdeclined. Therefore, expectations are now rest on the Gulf 8. Despite spite of all efforts to build the e-mobility, it is for first remain the bread-and-butter car of the Wolfsburg.

Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, non-alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, the World Conservation of of Nature CN reported in Brussels on Friday. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of which do do not occur on any other continent. Of these 26265 are are are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of endangerand and thus before extinction.
The IUCN classides angered species into six categories: from " potentially threatened " to " " threatened, " " highly angered, " " threatened extinction tion and and extextincincin " in nature " to " extinct. "
rowan and wild horse chestnut in threat
In Germany, mainly rowan (Sorbus) are threatened, one one of the authors, David Allen said to the German Press Agency. " Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway, or to the transformation or weakening of their habitats. "
It also looks bad for the wild horse chchestnuts. They are considered considered " anger" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The greatest threat threat is the Balkan miner motte next to a mushroom. It has spread since since the 1980s-east Europe Europe Europe across entire continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnut nuts Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 specimens. Not included in this assessment consideration are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Shrb species and mosses also in danger
The IUCN scientists simultaneously created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than one-of the molluscs and and mosses and almost half of all species of bhes are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to destruction of the wilderness, of species introduced species, agricultural practices, and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in recycling recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
" This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet, " said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office.

USA warn federal government of Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trutrust Chinese Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great, " Pai told the " Handelsblatt " with a view to setting up the new 5G mobile network.
China has a " national security law " that obliges each company " under Chinese jurisdiction " to follow instructions from the security bodies.
Appliccurrent law also prohibits companies to inform third parties about such inquiries, " said the FCC CEO. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a " declaration of trustthinness " from suppliers.
Berlin wanted wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the " Handelsblatt blatt " relreference on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions lines of program code that change over time, " said Pai.
It was " very difficult to imagine " that a government agency, " no matter where, would would be able to review each individual update in real time to detect security risks, " the FCC chief continues.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque. The employee company, which allesedly owns the company, is not necessarily independent of the government, " Pai told the " Handelsblatt. "
The USA is had findings according to which government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to promote the position of the USA.

Access to the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork they do not have despite the long-term rental ases. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by specially founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for for which parent parent company only only within narrow limits.

New global climate protests of Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people again want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metses such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests ǀ Who are are Thunberg's backers?
sense of justice and courage are high virtues, also in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm up the climate. All the more astonishing that that a 16-year-old girl holds the mirror in the nose of the power people of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses motion and makes young people to rise for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win a a collection of children and young people ents. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt himself was chosen to stand up for a more er world. At that time, he was able able to win a crowd of young people for his own and and persuade them to cross the sea to get to the Promised Land, similar as Greta Thunberg recently recently off on the trip to America with a sailboat.
But is there a dark side in this? Why Why it need a share called " We don't have time " to save the world? Furthermore, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. At the the way, her mother has published a book, has sold far-reaching, thanks to the daughter standing in the spotlight. Even-proven followers of Greta Thunberg were also a little indignant about the last PR show, or the the trip by boat was probably also too ly ly up on some successors. This This is not unfounded, because the action was very very very in in the the worldwide and a lot of money money thanks to the imposing action.
Here the spirits are separated: Is it morally right to finanrich financially in in saving saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people people work together with stock market brokers during the world rescue action? No matter which position is ultimately taken to this, critical and reflreflected viewpoint is increasingly more important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make make to cricritically tically also ous ous pious projects by certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A foreign comet is crossing our solar system at the moment.
The astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: A foreign comet is crossing our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star crosting another star in our solar system. It was baptized after its discoverer 2I / Borisov and is currently employying astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in the Crimea. He looked towards the sky with a-made telescope and further follow follow-ups confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet, which does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind, which was sighted during flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get insights into a foreign solar system from close. Apparently, the Comet is emto those of our own system, as the Astastrophysical Institute of the aries Islands. The comet, to the International Astronomical Union (IAC)) is clearly interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-hyperhyperorbit that leads it out of our system.
Comet was already spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it is ready, the astronomers can observe him in detail. Unlike unlike its predecessor,, 2I / Borisov has already sighted in his approach, which means that it can be be examined from Earth for many months. " The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then still be seen by April 2020-medium telesces until April 2020, " explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa. " After that that, it will only only be observed with larger, professional, estelesuntil 2020. "
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 " Oumuamua. "
First findings on comet 2I / Borisov arawaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time the celestial body appears to similar to our comets - because as the Iresearcher Julia de León expresit it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets could form themselves other solar systems other similar systems that in in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years, possibly allow a new way of exploration of certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again asteroids are loy the researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid raced past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
