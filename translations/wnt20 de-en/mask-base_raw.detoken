Oil tanker " Stena Impero " left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British tanker, " Stena Impero " left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas this Friday. As ship-observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. The destination port was specified as Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said that they wanted to wait for an official decision from outside Tehran.
The " Stena Impero " had been raised on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the sea street of Hormuz on charges of having violated security regulations. However, it was suspected that that Iran reacted to the controversial, temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tker before the Great Britain, belonging to Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important seal roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in the past months. Merchant shipping was been drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There were several incidents with tankers and drones.

Musk strives for a delivery record
Tesla's quarter may hold a record. Despite the delivery boom, there were recent losses at the electric car group.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given a strong boost on the stock market to his electric car group with the prospect of new record numbers. " We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, " Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek. "
The demand was strong so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customers. Therefore, Tesla had to use as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares were out from trading with an increase of more than six percent. This is not the price has not increased so strongly for almost four months. Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous record value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 it wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400,000 cars. This must be six digit figures in the current and coming quarter-year. Above all the most favourable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were recent losses.
Riddle solved: Therefore we cannot tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from being able to tick themselves. Scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found this out with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress was also made on the question of why children fight so ehemently against tickling, then only to ask for more.
After all, it was also shown why the approaching of a tickling hand alone, triggers laughter even before the touch. This is due to a low-lying layer in the cerebrum, which already triggered laughter with the expectation of tickling.
According to the information, earlier research showed that rats react with " smile " in the ultrasound area when they are tickled by humans. This " laughter " is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-contact
So far, it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-contact and contact by others - and that is why humans cannot tickle themselves. However, in the experiments on the rats, the Berlin researchers discovered that the laughter and the activity of the respective area of the cerebral cortex were suppressed during a self-contact. This was also the case when living beings clean themselves. However, during the foreign contact and tickling by the scientists, the physical activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh had been increased.
But if the self-touch and the touch by others at the same time, the laughter was also suppressed. This indicates to the fact that the the brain of rat rat could not differentiate between the self-touch and the touch by others. The new findings suggested that the people cannot tickle themselves because the self self-touch activated a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Thus, they broke off this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showed escape behavior or frightening ness. This ambiivalence like the behavior of of children. The ambivalence of tickling was a behavioral reaction that is equal in rats and humans.

Iran releases British tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one problem less. The British oil tanker " Stena Impero, " detained in Iran,, could get back to sea. It could be a puzzle in Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero, " which has been detained in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities the ship is on her way to Dubai, according to the shipping company Stena Bulk.
" Stena Impero " left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical checks, among other things, said shipping chief Erik Hånell. At noon the ship left the Iranian waters. " It's nice that it is over, " he told the Swedish television station SVT.
The Foreign Ministry in London described the fixing of the ship as illegal. " This is part of a pattern of attempts to underair the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law, " it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had fixed the vessel on 19 July on the charge of having disthe rules of sea law in the the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well according to the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaacted professionally in view of the difficult and exhaueling situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working on reconnecting them together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British of Gibraltar behind the fixing of the " Stena Impero ": in beginning of July a super tanker ker with oil from Iran, which was have been intended for Syria, was laid to the chain. According According to the authorities the delivery violated EU EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The British received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of " piracy " and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the " Adrian Darya-1 " was finally released. Conjectures that it was a barter deal to free the " Stena Impero, " London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important seaside roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is shipped through the strait. The tensions in the region had intensified immensely in the past months. Merchant shipping was was drawn into the conflict between the United States and Iran. There were several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute of the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US went unilaterally abandof the international nuclear agreement, which to prevent Iran Iran Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then the US government has put pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a stricter agreement that has been extended to other areas. Iran has ts pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the " Stena Impero " and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for a military protection of merchant ships in the region.
At the UN General Assembly in New York he presented the Iranian President Hasan Ruhani a plan for the security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz. With the " Coalition of Hope " for the PerPersian Gulf, Iran wanted together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protards to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
India would actually be destined as a " war profiteeer. " In view of the punitive tariffs that America's President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic consider themselves to to rearrange.. Financial heads of Asian companies companies, who consider transferating their from from China another another in a UBS, call India as one of the preferred alternatives. However, this has not only to do with the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems perfectly suited to play a more important global role in the extensive global production chain.
But now India itself has come into Trump's focus. Djoratively by the wardog in the White House as the " Kingdom of tariffs, " America has withthe 2000 from the market early early June the trade benefits for of products. USA accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits,,,, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the friction with India, of course only a sidespoint. In addition, America considers the world's s largest democracy also through the security-policy glasses. Delhi and Washington connect the concern about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background a volve of American punitive tariffs seems unlikely to be against India. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just begun a second five-year term, should therefore sway in safety.
The problem, however, lies in another place: The empirically confirmed thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult stand in the socialist reof of. Even under Modi. His zeal for reform is mainly centred the the ratic insan, which stistiated for too long time for too long any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state. Companies now now receive faster construction permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and an insolvency and bankruptcy, more griy law creates conditions for the liquidation of emingly dead companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured and measured in the relevant rankings. In the first five years of operation, a lot of economic optics has turned for the better in India. But this is not true in trade policy. The national-conservative government even established new new barriers, which by this motivated to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, Modi hangs the braus of the energetic reformer who radically renew his country. This impression is due not least least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows too well the good vocvocvocarabulary of Western managers. However, basically, however, the " India First " lawyer has never moved away from a protectionist economic policy which prevents Indian companies from being forced to rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for the global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the foreclosing of their industries, belong to the main voters of Modi nationalist Bharatiatia Janata Party and gossip these short-considered policies.

Tore the competitors to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The world of the world was long already in the line when heart-warming scenes took place in the down of the Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men of over 5000 meters Jonathan Busby started from Aruba ba dangerously swaying. He could hardly hold on his feet feet a good meters meters from the finish, ran in an unhealthy bended position, when Mr. Braima Suncar Dabo, coming from the west-African country Guinea-Bissau, suddenly dragged under him and supported him the last half-round into the finish. However, the forces of the two were enough to stop the the wristwatch running after the run-through, as if the scene had not been curiious enough.
" I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing, " Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely drew the attention from the attention of the assembled journalists. Shy, he first to the his,, he didn not want to talk about it at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best at all, and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway he would only be proud of it to represent his country, which had been invited by the federation for the World Cup. Under normal circumstances he would not have started started. " That's why I'm proud to be running here for my country, " he said.
He did this in the evening with emphasis - and much more intensive than he would have thought of. Because this heroic act will remain in memory. Especially since Dabo even gave his rival Busby the lead in the finish and voluntarily took over the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this race. In the end, it had nothing used, because BusBusby, came to the finish with a lot of help was precisely disqualified at the end of the World Light Athletics Association.
Dabo, who is living in Portugal and studying there in Lisbon, was competing to set a personal personal best at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this succeeded with 18: 10.87 minutes, but he himself was still disappointed: " I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. I was under 18 18 minutes. " However, only in practice, the best times do not count.
Millionmash: Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible anti-government protests. There was an increased police presence in the in of Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were blocked.
In recent days, the police had increased their street checks and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians in part for news and photos in connection with the protests. Hundreds reds had already been arrested, according to two NGOs.
Opponents of Al Sisi
Last weekend, hundreds of participants in protests had place in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. They were directed against the government of President Abddel Fattah al-@-@ Sisi, the critic accuse of corruption and mismanagement. There such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt had for years. The Egyptian contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, living in the country in Spanish exile, who brought the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook rolling, has called today for a " million march at central places in the country. This Friday. Ali demands a " popular revolution revolution. " For most young tians, the man is not a ", " because he worked as a subcontractor for the army millions but his es are coming.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests increased further according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) as well as Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. At the ingly, these figures could not be confirmed confirmed. Also, the government government did not confirm or comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were " arbitrrarily arrested, " only because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, " as HRW said, citing lawyers. According to their lawyers, the allegations against those who ainainees range from the " spread of misinformation, " to the of membership in a " terrorist association. " According to HRW, in Cairo, Alexandria, and other cities, arbitrarily quesed and searched security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services in order to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Mail retailers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns land on the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products rather than destroy them.
Companies could not be able to exempt from the sales tax on donations in kind, explained the ministry to a question of the Greens federal parliamentary group, on which the newspapers of the Funk Media Group reported on Friday. However, the retailers could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would not have to pay any or only little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens send back every sixth parcel when ordering goods online. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - then ended up in the trash. According to current legal, donating would cost the companies an additional money, because the tax authorities evaluate donations in kind a sales, which is subject to sales tax.
Greens group leader Katrin-Göring-Eckardt called on the Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies cannot evaluate the products for sale accordingly and donate free of charge to non-of organizations. Companies themselves should be able to rely on not to be penished for donations. This would apply not only for online trade, but also for other businesses from fashion stores to the hardware market.
Banksy art at auction: There has never been a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-star Banksy, " Devolved Parliament, " is soon to be auctioned off.
For Branczik, Banksy's work " highlights " the regression of the oldest-oldest parliamentary democracy in the world to the basic attitude shaped by animals and tribes. " " From Saturday, the painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated to be 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol of Bristol in the southwest of Great Britain where where Banksy lives. This year the artist had exhibited the painting again at the time of the original Brexit on March 29. Later, the work, formerly known as the " Question Time, was renamed " Devolved Parliament. "
The picture could change hands for a million.
Most recently, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson had a tough deal with the opposition on Wednesday at the first session of Commons after the repeal of a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to complete the Brexit already postpostponed on October 31, if necessary, without an agreement with the EU.
This is not the first time that Banksy whose identity is still unknown has ever interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in south-eastern England, he painted a picture depicting a man who with a chisel breaking a star of the European flag. The work is seen by thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day as they enter the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a " walk in the park "
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fierce verbattacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not think his top adviser does not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a " walk in the park, " said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book launch. " " We enjoy it. We will quit (from the EU) and we will win. "
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in parliament hard in recent days and accused them, among other things, " betrayal " among the people. Accusations that he could bring the MPs in danger, because they could become the target of death threats, he " Humbug " disabmissed.
Cummings said that the only way to let back peace was if the MPs would finally respect the decision taken by the British to leave the EU. It is not surprising that the people would be upset, that Britain still had not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called ed for restraint on Friday. " We should speak to each other with respect, " said a statement. " And we should listen. "
Pakistan Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
In his first appearance before the UN General Assembly, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan made an emotional appeal calling on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said at the UN general debate in New York on Friday. " If this goes wrong, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst. " The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashashmir. " You should have prevented that. "
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of which are around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate part of Kashmir, while another part belongs to China. In the beginning of August, India had withdrawn autonomy status of the Indian Kashmir and abruptly the tensions in relations with Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the fall of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government's protests in Egypt are reacting with a hard hand. It lets firfirfirwith live ammunition at the population, over a 2000 detained in the prisons join the 60,000 political prisoners already prisoned there. Protesting has never been unless in Egypt. But since since since takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi Sisi in 2013, the state apparis doing all its utmost to avoid a scenario in the times of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, the lack of, and the feeling of being stifled by the own government, have driving millions to the streets. And this is a problem that even the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control, no matter how hard it procegoing against adversaries. The situation has even worsened.
Today every third person in Egypt is living below the poverty-line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is at ten percent. Who wants to buy buying a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who to finance: Nestlé, Coca-de-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression, but also the biggest economic participtor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. This was already the case before el-Sisi. The Egyptian people has much experience with authoritarian regimregimes, the dilemlemma in the supermarket is old. It always becomes critical when large sections of the population have difficulties to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv-Tests in the Terminal: BER-Chef: No more " Showstoppers " for Hauptstadtairport
Two months were tested to see whether the complex plant braid for BER fire protection works together. The operators are satisfied with the course. But the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, " said chairman of the supervisory board Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control panel.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there are still defects to work in the terminal. " We have many detail topics, but we do not have a real showstopper. " He assured that the schedule up to commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The indication of construction works is now to be submitted to the building office during the first quarter of 2020, as was planned for the beginning of the year this autumn.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables have to be corrected; the Tüv wants to examine these by February. " In order to create the conditions here for the start of the flight, the work continue to be intensively on processing with the deficiencies, " said a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no approval for all dowels on which the cable lines are hanging. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
Moreover, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not work satisfactorily. The problems had led the project into another crisis already three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons, which shut in a fire like a screen so that the smoke does not spread. They go down too far. Therefore. 36 engines have to be replaced. Then, there should be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was supposed to go operational in 2011. Since the start of construction in 2006 costs have increased from two billion to approximately EUR 6.5 billion for the opening next year.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the people responsible are planning to expand the airport. This is why the is going to happen in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial chief Heike Fölster will join Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, and HR manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She had put the finances on firm feet.

In the midst of the price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA " takes over the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna, " confirmed a Austrian Airlines spokesperson to APA on Friday. Previously, " AviationNetOnline " reported on this.
The Viennese base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will be dissolved de facto. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft will remain in Vienna. From A 2020, the January 2020 in the " Wetlease ase', including Eurowings personnel. In future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, explained the spokesperson. The flight times will be coordinated to connecting flights. The aim is on the one hand, to strengthen the hub Vienna and on the other hand to expand decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a " production company " for the company's sister AUA. For, Barcelona and Rome would be served with the AUA flight number, but primarily with the Eurowings device. The on-board flight product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, Eurowings ings flights starting as the AUA flight number will no longer be handled in Terminal 1, but like the AUA in Terminal 3.
A price war broke out at Vienna Airport after the Niki bankruptcy. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced only Thursday Thursday that the the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer increase. Therefore, the Irish low cost carrier sends four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called " wet lease, " which the union criticised as a bypass of the collective agreement.
The statement made by Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, was answered by AUA CEO Andreas Otto on Friday: " We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years. "

Study on Causes of Heart Disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what is really trigcause a heart failure or infarction? Hamburg researchers want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
By analyzing the genome of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to investigate more detail into the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of its kind in German-speaking countries, as the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. The Switzerland-based mountain Clinic Davos, owned by the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the most uncontrollable risk factors for cardiovascular. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, it was said that the interplay between genes and external influences is not sufficiently well known. Now Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Cardiovascular Center at the UKE.
According to the clinic, more than 4000 possible disease-causing DNA - called mutations - are currently known in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes. Every year about 200 are added and added.
According to the initiators, the five-year project aims to develop new options for the prevention, detection,, and treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure, and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in researching other diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New insights into the interaction between the heart and brain, the heart and kidney as well as as cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82 82), also stressed that there is a firm will to use the data for research into other diseases. So far, the clinic clinic in Davos is mainly concerned with allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to arise on the medical incampus and a proforship for biobioinformatics is be created To explain his commitment the logistics entrepreneur from the residency in Switzerland said that he had an open heart surgery in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The organic samples of the healthy participants come from the Hamburg residents, who also participate in the " Hamburg City Health Study. " With 45,000 test,, according to the hospital, this is the largest local health study in the world. When the coding of genetic genetic attention is strictly paid to the protection of the anonymous data, assured the scientists. It is about one petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the genome of a person can now be decoded within just 24 hours. The pure material costs would be to 1300 euros. The first gene gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, still cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to start on October 1, all 9000 samples are to be analyzed by the end of 2020 and first results are expected for results next year.
Nigerian police rescue hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to hints from local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some victims, who are still minminor, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo reported. " The victims were abused. some of them said they had been raped by their teachers, " Sabo said.
The boys had been detained under the pretext of being taught and " correcded " in the Koran. Indeed, the protégés had been held by their teachers in " most degrading and inhuman conditions, " said Sabo. About a hundred students, among them were children at the age of nine, had been chained in a small room.
According to information, the Koran school had been for about ten years. ResResidents had drawn attention to the authorities of repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents had been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had not had any idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the mainly Muslim north of Nigeria there are plenty of private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to data from the UN Refugee Aid Agency, in the past ten months more than 40,000 people have fled across the border from Niger to the neighbouring Niger.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police frees 400 children out of school
Police officers have released nearly 400 400 students from horrific backgrounds in a school in northern Nigeria. " Many of them were chained, and some have had visible injuries that ating torture, " said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children had been discovered on Thursday after a hint in an Islam@-@ oulded school. The conditions there were " " inhumane. " The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held like slaves at their school and put on chains. Some of them were sexually abused. Television images showed emaciated and injured students in noticeably poor health.
World Soccer Election: Further accusations after Messis and Klopps Freestyle
Football " signature not valid "
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Association awards the best player, the best female player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, this is the sixth honour for Messi.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations from other countries are coming to Fifa. Egypt was not assessed at all - with a curious reason.
Much of the FIFA has proven to be unutable in recent years: the World Cup awards, bibibidious plans GiGiGiGiantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. So far, however, the FIFA fa World Football Election has not been suspected of running irless - - one, apart from the fact that the voting national coach and national captains of the member associations often vote for sympathy rather than objectively.
But after Nicaragua's captain had complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly downloviewable voting overview.
Fifa apologizes to the fact that " the signatures on the election forms were written in capital letters and were therefore not valid. " The Egyptian federation was contacted several times in order to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan's coach also puzzled
There is also an outcry from Sudan with regard to be the election. While the situation is understandable in the case of Egypt, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the way it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi on place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio ManMané on three. According to Fifa the vote was received the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also raised accusations: " I did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All the information on my vote are wrong, thank you, " he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Federation simply voted on his behalf.
The message of the federation came on Friday now: True, but of course was no intention. The completed election documents were " mistroneously provided with the name and the signature of Juan Barr, the captain of the the Nicaraguan selection, it said in a message of the feder. but,,,, by the second captain Manuel Rosas. " We take the responsibility for the administrative error, " it said in the statement. Both Rosas as and the team trainer Henry DuDuarte voted for " Messi, " as it says in the official list of FIFA. "
The other cases has now the Finow in an investigation, but emphasizes, that the election process was supervised supervised by the consulting company PriceWatououseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans speak out in favour of official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly advocated an official investigation against US president and party affili, Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, " said Republican Governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. " Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are established. " He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the discontinuation of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has observed Biden " for years. "
The Republicans have so far kept criticised Trump over the whistleblower affair, but few have been uncomfortable about it. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia has already repeatedly opposed Trump's policies repeatedly, such as the easing of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also called for the investigation. " It's a deeply disturbing situation, " Mr. Baker said. " The right approach and responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it. "
As governor of states, Scott and Baker do not formally have formal say in the proceedings against Trump, which are decided in the gressional; their statements are, therefore, all, symbosymboally important. Nevertheless, the first Republican sensencans also voiced critical of the situation. Mitt Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was " extremely disturbing, profoundly disturbing. " US media also report that there were first internal cks rioccurring among the Republicans.
The affair could result in an impeachment case against Trump, and the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation accusing him of abusing power to exercise foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for impeachment. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could demand an impeachment, but the decision on an impeachment would fall to the Senate, where Trump's Republicans hold the majority. So the prospects for such a success are low. So far no US president has been dismissed by an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board Racketes Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily; they are said to have been raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had unlawfully set off to the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship " Sea Watch 3 " and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After strong protests and international criticism - also from Austria's President Federal President, Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted again after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now, new serious accations against Rete are raised. For Thus, three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have arrived in Italy with the " Sea-Watch 3. " The suspects have been arrested in a reception centre in Messina, Sicily ily, after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. " We cannot rule out this, but we have no secured information about it, " said Sea-Watch spokesman, Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
In mid-September, the police reported that the suspected suspects had raped, tortured and even murdered in the North African country. The were was Mohammed C., 27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians, A. Hameda, 26 and Mahmoud A, 24. " The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence, " it reported at the time.
NGO and aid organizations now point out that they don't know exactly who comes on the ships. " We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports, " said Neugebauer. " Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. Therefore, it is quite likely that there rators are also on the ships. " It is therefore very important that this is investigated. "
Italy's right-wing ex-interior minister, Matteo Salvini, immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, against who is still being investigated in Italy for assisting in illegal immigration.
Musk aims to set delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, " Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek. "
The demand was strong so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customers. Therefore, Tesla had to use as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares came from trading with an plus of more than six per cent. The price has not been up that much for almost four months now. Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous record value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This must be six-figure figures in the current and coming quarter. Above all, the most affordable Tesla 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were recent losses.
US Budget Controversy: Again, Only a Bridge Financing
The new financial year will begin in the US on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has approved a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the expenditure limits for financial years of 2020 and 2021, the United States are again before the new fiscal year, beginning on October October, once again without spending plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and adopted a continuing resolution (CR) until November 21. Without such a decision there would have been a shutdown on Monday at midnight, a closure of the federal administration. Still President Trump has to put the decision into force.
Shutdown
For the time being, the federal administration is now financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019 ended on Monday. This because Congress could not agree on the 12 the 12 spending laws, which allocate locate funds to the various departments and authorities in time. Therefore, the federal administration cannot benefit from the currently extended spending framework for the new financial year from $trillion to $1.4 trillion.
The Democrats have completed ten of twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the US-dominated Republican Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less willing not to hold a majority.
The minds are divided mainly on the issue of the allocation resources for the domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of President Trump's major priorities. The Democrats disrupt the wall plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the wall had already calated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
Ghosts Divide at the Construction of the Wall
It is currently unclear how the parties want to get closer on this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension beyond of the transitional financing beyond the 21 November. Also a shutdown is then not excluded.
Against the background of Congress's inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated danger of shutdowning, ideas for automate the process of popularity. Submission p. 1877 on the idance of shutdowns, the financing of the federal administration would each each continue at the previous year's level, stopping the travel of parliamentarians and holding back their wages until new annual spending plans were made.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination is to be open also to women and lesbians who live alone: The Paris National Assembly voted with a large majority in favour of a government bill according to which all women can claim for in in-vitro fertilization. Thus the demand for anonymous sperm donations should increase significantly.
The proposal still requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that in the future numerous " children without a father " could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Health Minister Agnès-BuBun defended as an " opportunity " for society. It represents the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her notion, the costs of artificial inseminations for all women should be borne by social security.
Fertilization with sperm of dead husband further outlawed
By a narrow majority, the National Assembly, however, has rejected an amendment that should give widows for artificial insemination access to the sperm of her husband. In Belgium, Spain, and Britain, artificial insemination is allowed " post mormortem. " In Germany, there have been cases in which women in vain ain ain complained about the release of the sperm of a deceased. The opponents of the push in Paris argued that such a child genchild child then bear a " particularly difficult fate. "
Many members of the ruling party of La République en Marche (The Republic in motion, REM) of President Emmanuel M. Macron and the members of the opposition spoke out in favour of artificial insemination with the sperm the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow is imposed " " double grief " if if due of her death her wish to have children remains unfulfilled.
The initiators of the amendment, which has now failed, consider it unfair that in future a widow may be able to be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed heterosexual couples who cannot have children. They must be married or live together for at least the next two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would still be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - nonetheless, it is often difficult for single individuals or lesbian couples.
Compensation payment for climate: calls for flight charges for universities are getting louder
There is a lot being flown at the universities. That's why the country wants to have a climate tax also there there in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internal pressure.
The universities, too, should restrict themselves to flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion about a climate tax on flights from universities and colleges postponed before the summer break is getting ating again. After the Rectors' Conference responded skepeptically to an initiative from the country's green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students from six universities in Baden-Württemberg and a pedagogical university plead for a compensation for service flights. This is an " urgent necessary as a first step, " at the time there must be a debate debate the avoidability of flights flights flights, in their statement. The proposed cabinet decision, originally planned in July, is still further on ice, but because the CDU has still not yet for the presentation of the Greens.
Russia once again arrests on North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB FSB, the detainees are said to have illegally fished in Russian waters. Ten days earlier 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Back, there was an exchange of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. This time there were no casualties, they said.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. Accordingly, the North Korean fishermen were in Russian territorial waters. There, according to their own information, the Russian Coast Guard is patrolling to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 octopus seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 clefish on the boats had been discovered and seized. In addition, the data were seized after three fishing boats and two seized and brought to Nachnodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's fishing authority had also not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, due to the lawlawfiled by local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have according to media, been temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Primorsky Far-Eastern region, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained about high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close knit synthetic nets forbidden in Russia. With these would also small creatures were taken out from the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed in the sea where they would need 200 years to decompose.
In the future only 18,000: USA to lower asylum upper limit
The " most generous nation in history ": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officers in the White House.
The richest country in the world is closing itself off from those seeking protection: as the State Ministry confirms in Washington, the ceiling for the legal influx of refugees will be further reduced. In the future, endangered believers and Iraqis will be given asylum.
The US government wants to again lower the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as explained by the US State Department. In the now-ended marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump's administration has drastically reduced the receptivity of asylum seekers from around the world over the past few years, with far higher reception limits in applied under the previous administration of Barack Obama.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was introduced in 1980, but the State Department still described the US as the " " most merciful and generous nation " in history, " a phrase that strongly recisthe the language of the the US president.
A " responsible handling " of refugees aims to enable the refugees to return to their home countries in order to help with the reconstruction there, explained Trump. For his hard course in migration policy, he receives a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to close off. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency. It is unclear whether there is a time link between the current measure and the current domestic developments in the US capital. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selensky affair and a possible threat of imimachment proceedings.
According to the Foreign Office, the US government wants to concentrate on the admission of two future refugee groups: people who are to be persecuted because of their beliefs and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as the statement the the Department State Department. However, a maximum of 1,500 refugees are to be received from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The USA wants to ensure that especially people from this " northern triangle " of Central America apply for asylum in other countries.Against this background, the United States only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also also with El Salvador and Honduras, in order to contain immigration on the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
A female orangutan has been transferred from the former Argentine justice to a reception station in the USA at the request of the zoo of Buenos Aires. To the " Sandra " born in 1986 in the Zoo in Rostock, the rights were granted to a " nonhuman person, " which is why their release is obligmandatory. The animal was brought by direct flight to Dallas on Thursday evening - not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold, as attlawyer Andrés Gil Domínguguez.
The the 53 kilogram heavy human key is unable to adapt to the life in the wild, it is to live in the outdoor enclosures of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There already 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees are located, among them " Bubbles, " a former pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving to Florida in Florida, " " Sandra " must go through a 40-day quarantantantantine at Seddgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.
After her birth " Sandra " spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsensenkirchen in Rostock, before was moved to the Buenos Aires in 1995. The " Sandra's " rights rights rights rights rights, initiated by animal rights in 2014, has contributed to the transformation of Buenos Aires Buenos Aires into an ecopark park. By 2023, a research and educational center will be built for the preservation of biodiversity.

Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The US sportsgoods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profits regardless of the trade conflict with China. Net profit rose in the past quarter to $1.4 billion (just under 1.3 billion euros), which is 25 percent more than the same period of the previous year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. The main reason for this is the new marketing strategy " Nike Direct, " with which the Adidas competitor turns online directly to its customers.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the period of the month to the end of August. Nike sales sales rose most strongly with an increase of 22 percent in percent. Thus, the group from Beaverton in Oregon, USA, also benefbenefited in the People's Republic from its approach to address itself directly to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
CFO Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the " digital transformation " of the sporting goods manufacturer with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors reacted with ily to the quarterly financial figures - the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer rose by more than five percent.
Lifelong ban on the stadium for racism in Italy
Because of racist comments on soccer player Juan Jesus from AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a life-long ban on a fan. Jesus, defender, originally from Brazil, had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. " @ officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. # NoTo@-@ Racism. Proud to be who I am, " wrote the 28-year-old, who has played at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded on late Thursday. He reported the account of the fan on Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma supporters should never visit a game of the club, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant out racist insults against black players of rival teams. " We can't have any racism in society or in sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. One must identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums, " said Fifa Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The reason for the statement were racist chants at the first league match between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florenz last Sunday.
But there had also been discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rimping fans of record champions Juventus from the stadium. Four of them may no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police announced. Therefore, prohibitions of four to seven years apply to the rest.
The fans are in contact with ongoing investigations against twelve leading ultra-fan groups in the vicinity of Juventus. The twelve are accused, among others, of severe extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had set the investigation rolling with an advertisement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders are supposed to be behind the black trade of tickets. They had " militarily controlled the ticket trade for the fan curve and to have blackmailed Juventus employees in order to get more affordable tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - entire vintages are treated with caty names. To take a closer look, the awards are full of contradictions. How well do these labels describe the way of life of young people?
" The Crabs are coming! " With this call, the Crab Catch at Gucheng's Lake Gaochun officially started September 21, usheralding the opening ceremony of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Art Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.

Conflict between Iran and the US: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
On his return from the General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan-Ruhani spoke of an alleged offer by the US to lift all sanctions. The United States had promised to aged an end to all sanctions in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani stated on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: " Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no. "
Ruhani describes the events in this way: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron have been present in New York and insisted that a meeting should take place. " And America says that I will lift the sanctions, " added Ruhani. The nature of the unialties that were to be have have been in the debate. " And they clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions. "
However, this advance did not take place in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticised. In view of the current punitive measures and " the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure, " no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning, Angela Merkel and Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The hope of the Europeans was that to save the nuclear agreement with Iran Iran, negotiated with Russia and China, intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President, Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel on the fringes of the UN General Assembly, expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - almost 200 aftershocks
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of a catastrophe grows 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the previous earthquake, there had been almost 200 aftershocks, the Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday, said. This is the concern about a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the metropolis of millions. Now the government wants to establish a commission better to prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, announced Oktay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential buildings are collapin - among other things, worn down by the many smaller earthquakes, that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces that have been registered as refuges in the center, have long been built. It was only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcüük earthquake, in August, the Istanbul Engineering Chamber of Istanbul warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the earthquake on Thursday was in the Sea of Marmara in front of the district Silivri and in about seven kilometers depth, as reported civil disaster Protection authority Afad. A smaller after-shock caused a few minutes later for even greater panic on the streets.
The mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that those injured or damage were not reported at the beginning. The state radio station TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Pupils were brought from the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some students cried, as could be seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered as particularly earthquake earthquake to earthquake. Under the Marmarmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly in 1999 was the earthquake near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 might threaten. But when it comes to the earthquake is unclear. In the earthquake on Thursday it again hit the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design contingency plans, private people have finished so-called go-bags with all the necessities packed next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wobbles. When the next big quake comes, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered suffered minor damage. The Mayor of Istanbul Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the " Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre " (Akom). According to his reports, two minarets of mosques in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts collapsed.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On social networks, many users report panic. Buildings were obbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It had been more violent than Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent moon, Kerem Klinik, warned about aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from the buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The date of the earthquake ake is officially at 13: 59 (local time). A few minutes after the first earthquake, according to CNN Turkey there was an aftershock indicated with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt felt as far as Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Sea of Marmara west of the million-million metropolis, the disaster protection authority Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there may be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually undischarge - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a preliminary warning. It has become more likely as a result, he told CNN Türk. " These could be the signs of a bigger earthquake, " said Erersoy to the sender. " Sooner or later the big quake will come. "
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the earthquake also triggered great concerns in Istanbul. In addition, there had also been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 people injured. Earth had been shaking at Lake Constance also this year.

There is only one single answer to this: write. " McEwan's novel " Machines like Me " on Artificial Intelligence was only appeared published in the spring.

Stalling Brexit negotiations: The risk of a no-deal remains acute
In fact Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly agreed: With him will certainly not be guaranteed a third delay of the Brexit negotiations on the Brexit period. But what statements are of a lasting duration already with the polarizing British. The most recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Great Britain hoats like a sword of Damocles over the head of Blondles. His suspension of Parliament in order to be able to carry out his Brexit course until the date of withdrawal, was annulled beginning of this week. And a law passed by Parliament requires Johnson to effect an extension of the bilateral talks with the EU in the event of failed negotiations until October 31. However, Johnson and Johnson had categorically ically ruled ruled out of this.
Boris Johnson considers deal still possible
But the pressure does not seem to be noticeable to Johnson. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he made hints that in the event of non-agreement, he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we will follow the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And preferably with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is gradually running off the Brexit-negotiators in Brussels. The EU and British-negotiators-negotiators have about six weeks to come to prevent a withdrawal from Britain the European Union without agreements. But even again the latest talks have achieved no break@-@ through. An agreement until the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at moment. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further postponing the withdrawal date is in force. The opposition does not trust in the words of of Prime Minister. It fears that Johnson could somehow manage to secure the Brexit in the case of a no-deal.

The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar explorer. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak up. It had known for decades that the Earth was warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
" What happens in the sea often takes place under exclusion from the public, " said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the pollution of the oceans. Among other things during the expedition, Greenland glglacier ice was measured with a drone and fished for micro-plastics with nets, " they said.

Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: That seemed too much to two Japanese tourists. Including the bill with 80 euros in tip was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
" Such cases damage the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to look up the question of whether this is a fraud, " demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
Prompt came the reaction of owners of the restaurant. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. Also a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, said the innkeeper.
A call in Ukraine Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually be faced with impeachment proceedings after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to examine with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk about weeks until a decision is made.
The scandal is allegedly at the beginning of the telephone call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr, Zelensky. The charge of the German whistlebslower, who finally brought the conversation to the public out of concern for national security and democracy of the USA with his complaint, is monstrous:: The president had abused the power of his office in order to exploit the government of another country for an influence on the 2020 election. He had said that had had exexexmail zed use of dency of Ukraine and thus wanted to force them to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also evident in the meanwhile published transcript of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not reflect the full wording. However, the call on July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, whose center beside Trump Trump above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story starts from the public perspective in May 2019, when when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giulianani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet meet with the newly elected president, Selenskyi, and the lawyer lawyer knows very well that his intentions are delicate. " We do not get involved in an election process, we interfere in an investigation, what we have the right to do, " says the newspaper. " One might think that it is inappropriate, but " nothing is illegal is illegal. " Giuliani wants an investigation to be prosecuted in Ukraine for which there is hardly any basis - - " because this information will be very, very much helpful to my client and could prove to be helpful to my government. "
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracies fantasies focused on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in the Ukraine, critics said at the time to create grounds for Russia's investigation in America. However, this charge could never be taken seriously.
It is about the investigation about which Trump will speak so prominently on the phone with Selenskyi in July. The version of Giuliani and the president is this: The former vice president and currently promising applicant for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as the Ukraine representative of the Obama administration, pushed for the dismissal sal sal of the then Ukrainian attorney general Viktor Choin. In, to stop responsible investigation of the gas company, in whose supervisory board his son Hunter, BiBiBiden Biden senior had financially extorted Ukraine, in order to cover up the corrupt machinations of his family.
In fact the process was somewhat different. When Joe-Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General must go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Moreover, Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt behavior, the US government was far from the only Western partner who pushed for his dismissal. Incidentally, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigations against the company.

Attention: charging smartphone NIE wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come on the market that support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - most of all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature battery
Researchers will warn against wireless charging of smart phones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees three hours. In the wireless charging, the researchers, even with perfect alignment, of the smartphone on the charging pad always measured above 30 degrees. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the watt of the charging pad increases, which in turn increases the power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only penalized in capacity, but it does not last so long as a whole. Thus, the the fespan is lower. Therefore, the researchers therefore therefore, to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery replacement of modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, and this should be a helpful tip. Apple has at last increased the cost of a battery replacement even again - and for all iPhones.

The technology is extremely convenient: Just put the device on a appropriate charging pad - these are now even already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without any annoying cable salad and and tedious plug dle milling. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy energy transfer) a worldwide prevestablished standard, in which Apple even participates exceptionally, there are few restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should be used only in exceptional cases.
Everest traffic jam photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber according to his own has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within only six months. Nirmal-Purja (36) had reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project " Mission Possible. " He has made international headlines: He has taken a viral photo in the spring of climbers standing on the queue in Everest.
The picture of the mass range triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848 meter high mountain and the highest peak on earth. In May, eleven climbers died during the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Currently, Chinese authorities block the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is among among is bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China to enable him to ascend.
Four dead elephants in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. " We suspect that the elephants were poisoned. "
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited former rock rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the beanimals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
Almost 200 elephants are killed every year in Sri Lanka. The perpetrators are often farmers, on whose land the animals had previously kept themselves harmharmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants annually. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. theoretically, their killing is the death penalty.

" Apparently, we are dealing with a bad example of management greed. "
Experts say genes are overestimated in colon cancer risk
The role of genes play in familially increased colorectal cancer risk has been overestimated. So, this is what researchers of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg conclude in a recent study. Other risk factors, such as family eating habits, are probably more important than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of individual colorectal cancer, emphasizes the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog " Electrek. " The demand was strong so that Tesla could book 110 000 orders, it was continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the customers quickly. To this end, Tesla has to use as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares came from trading with a plus of over six per cent. The price has not been up so strongly for almost four months. Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, it wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This will require six-figure figures in the current and coming quarter. Above all, the cheapest Teséla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low. Despite of recent boom, there have been losses.
Does British government want to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is disried about whether he is looking for ways of circumventing the law against an unregulated Brexit, which had the last passed by parliament. In responding to a question on Friday he told journalists merely that his government would comply with applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a postponement of the exit date if no agreement has been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a " surrender law, " which makes the negotiations with EU difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suspected on Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to bypass it. Johnson could use a procedural trick to delay the entry into force of the law to the time after leaving the EU.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October and the best way is to reach an agreement. "
Iran apparently drives up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European contractors in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. " Unfortunately, the European states show incompetence or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions, " Rohani said on Thursday at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. In case they did not stand to their promises, he foresaged " further steps, " away from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement on the prevention of a nuclear bomb, which contained in return the promise to Tehran to normalize the economic relations there. In 2018, the US singled out of the agreement alone to force Iran to " maximum pressure " to a change in in the considered aggressive Middle East policy " President Donald Trump's administration is trying to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and now now applies tough sanctions against Tehran again. Iran reresponded to this with a rep-up of the uranium enrichment limited in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or at least prepared for the use of the uranium centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to bear their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rohani susped. However, there will still be further talks that would hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani denies Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the batch has changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi-Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and Great Britain followed Monday's US-assessment that Teheran is responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iran-supported Houthi rebels in Yemen had committed themselves to the attack, but this was interpreted by the US as a false commitment. " We have nothing to do with it, " Rohani reconfirmed his position on Wednesday.
" Those who make such accusations must present evidence of this, " said Rohani. " However, European leaders could not have done it in the talks with him during the UN General debate. Instead, they had only claimed that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rohani in the past days days had met Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration had to be first lifted, demanded RoRouhanani. He urged the government in Washington to switch to a policy of " dialogue and reason. "

Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the depths of space. This was first achieved before. the comet allows us to draw conclusions about other solar systems.
What was initially only a gution has now been confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. According to its discoverer, the comet from the depth of space was baptias 2I / Borisov and aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The widely traveled comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory on the Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters diameter. Follow observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not come from our solar system.
Only 2I / Borisov, after 1I /' Oumuamua from 2017, is the second interstellar object to be seen during a a fly through of our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get insights into a foreign solar system from close up, before it disto see see again. First observations show that the inter- stellar comet resembles that of our own system, as is reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. " The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is, at distance, well above the typical speeds of objects biting the Sun, " reported Davide Farnocchia from the US Space space authority Nasa in a statement.
According to the analyses, the comet travels on a so-called " hyperblic " orbit that takes it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially named under the catalogue number C / 2019, Q4, received the name 2I / Borisov, and the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellstellar object that was discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: contrary to 1I /' Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been seen on the approach. This, the researchers have many months for investigations. " The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020, " explained Farnocchia. " After that, it will only be visible with larger professional telescopes until October 2020. "
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. Thus, a research team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I /' Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Surveys of the Gemini observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers of the astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have obtained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. " The spectrum of this object is similar to those of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar, " reported IAC researcher Julia de de León. " This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form by similar processes as in in our compladded de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar space visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new path for the exploration of processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such stp visits are. However, a planned satellite mission by the European Space Agency Esa could possibly intercept one of the next interstellar visitors.
According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, the agency intends to station the three-part spacecraft Comet Interceptor " at a waiting-waiting position at a distance of 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028. It will either lurk for a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system or for an interstellar visitor such as 1I /' Oumuamua.
First landing at Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just in time before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, the time has come: the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital has landed a first passenger plane of China United Airlines, a special honor for the captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are to be handled at the new airport every year, with a number of 72 million in 2025.China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. " China's recent prestige project is also called the " starfish " because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four runways, which are later to be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway system transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had announced several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been much smaller and under construction since 2006, has been postponed postponed. On the other hand, a first passenger plane already landed Beijing after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: from London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Agency in only four and a half hours - what the UK UK Space Agency Agency Agency dreams of. It is to make to make this flight, targeted for the 2030s, a special personic speed engine (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine), developed by Sabre, by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US broadccaster CNN. " This is the technology, which could definitely be it, " said agency director Graham. Turnock said. " We are talking about the 2030s for the commissioning, and the work is already very advanced. "
In order to drive the project forward, the British space Agency wants to work more closely with the Australian agency. A flight flight the British capital to the metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport, Concorde had the the New York-Paris route from 1976 1976 1976 the until ceof its operation in 2003 2003 and and took three to three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident took place at a Concorde at the Charles de de Gaulle airport in Paris, in which all 109 passengers died killed were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin plans plans plans to develop a personic aircraft together with the a US space agency, the " " X PlanPlane. " Virgin Galactic " also has such a program.
" Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport, " writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre re engine could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the earth's atmosphere, thus enabling the " next generation of truly reusable frame frame equipment. "
Uprising in Washington: Trump wants to find anonymous tipsters in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about the possible abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
" I want to know who gave the whistleblower with the information, " Trump said on Thursday to employees of the US embassy to the United Nations in New York. The person in question is almost " a spy " and with such people have been handled in the past " a little different " than today.
This was considered an attempt of intimidation against tiplers. Actually, the event was not to the public. However, several US media circulated audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats responded outraged at the president's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced preparations for an impeachment against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations rely mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer, who raises serious charges against Trump and his government headquarters. Due to great public pressure, the whistleb's accounts were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work the whistlebblower claims to have received information from several government officials, that the US president is " using the power of his office " to get another country to interfere in the US election in 2020.
At the center of the accusations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This deals about past business of Biden's son Hunter in the Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is ahead in the race for the democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower accused the White House of a cover-up with regard to the current Ukraine call: Leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been drawn. However, this was removed from a database usually database after the conversation on the instructions of lawyers from outside the House, and instead stored in a specially-protected system. So far only a rough protocol of conversation has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was about an employee of the foreign secret service, the CIA.
Trump once again challenged the source's credibility on Friday. In a series of tweets focusing on the subject, the president wrote that the so-called " whistleblower " had spread second-hand information that had turned out to be inaccurate. Therefore, there might be no ppsters or spies.
How Trump spoke in New York about those who are said to have leaked information to the whistleblower, trigoked outrage. US House of Representatives Leader Nancy PelPelosi responded with ingly, complaining that Trump's statement once again reduced the government's integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations have been running for months in various committees against Trump and his environment. In light of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pusforward investigations with new force to start a possible impeachment of Trump.
" The whistleblower has given a roadmap for our investigation, " said House Intelligence Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Schiff. Trump sharply attacked Schiff, accused of him of misrepresentation of things, and once again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump is scolding Schiff regularly and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US security and foreign-policy officials, who of the majority were working under Democratic but also Republican presidents, backed the Democrats " investigation for a possible impeachment ment case in a statement published on Friday. If the allegations come true, this would be an " unscrupulous abuse of power, " he said.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could implement a so-called impeachment procedure. But the decision on actual impeachment would fall in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are low. So far no US president has been stripped from office by an impeachment procedure.
VW Works Council: Jobs are dismantled " insidiously "
The plans of the VW brand, in which production to further reduce costs, could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is ts the works council of the carmaker. The brand wants to reduce its annual costs of ten billion euros by two billion by 2023 euros Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved already this year.
The " Future Pact of the Future P, " negotiated in 2016 between the company and the works council, provides until 2020 for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany, alone. In principle, a job can only be dismaned by the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer longer necessary. Moreover, an employment protection applies until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production, which were not actually at the disposal, are cut down " " creeping " in another way - so past the official course. Thus, becoming regular posts would often not be filled.
In these cases, the works council had no possibility to enforce the reoccupation. Meanwhile, there is a lack in many places, the work compression is increasing, the worries about a gradual hemorbleeding of the vehicle works would increase. Thus, the fear was also growing that the vehicle production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more affordable in other parts of the world. From VW, was only said: " An adjustment of the employment volume takes place, as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve. "
The VW brand wants to standardize global production even more and steer new projects centrally centrally. This is also intended to reduce costs and also accelerate decisions - the goal is driven by the aim to increase productivity and thus to to competitive competitiveness. Head of Production, Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: " Especially in uncertain times, from Brexit to the impending trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to help ourselves overcome the crisis. "
In this way there are already successes: For example, this year, for the first time since 2013, production costs per per vehicle would decrease compared to the previous year. Journalists, said Tostmann, the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on October 24 in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on the production time do not specify VW, according to information to our newspaper, it is around in the Golf 7.
20 Hours.
In our region, the main plant Wolfsburg is the only factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the internal rule of thumb applies is that that 800,000 cars have to be built every, so that the plant is satisfactorily profitable. However,,, capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling demand for diesel and the problems with the changeover to the new consumption and exhaust test method WLTP.
However, as Chief Production Officer Tostmann has already announced last year, one million new cars are rolling off the production line in the Wolfsburg " in perspective. " This is to make the bundling of golf production at the headquarters possible - because the Zwickau plant gives the golf production through the conversion to the location for e-car production.
Furthermore, the new SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are in Wolfsburg produced. However, the sales of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations are now based on the Golf f 8. Despite all the efforts to build the e-mobility, it should initially remain the bread-and-butter car of the Wolfsburg.
Forced to prostitution with Voodoo: traffickers sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been charged with oaths, conveyed to the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six alleged traffickers have to go to prison.
Six alleged traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and prison terms of up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The defendants had leiced young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced them to go prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian women willing to leave had had to make a ritoat home in home before a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean in inflatable boats with the help of Libyan smugglers. However, the dream dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed among different brothels in order to pay the the alleged smugglcosts of an average of 25 ,000 euros. Therefore wages were therefore completely taken off.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the injection and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels in the trial. " The work was physically physically and mentally ologically difficult for the women, " said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. " Some were really disgusted. "
The judgments are on commercial and commercial trafficking of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn the long-term dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the UFO flight attendant union has once again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will " inform about the industrial action in the LH Group on 14 October, " as UUfo Executive member of of Tariff Board informed Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary EuEurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with the Ufo for months. This also concerns the question of whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
In this point, Ufo now sees itself " strengthened following a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. " Lufthansa wanted to establish that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The The rejected the applications.. The company confirmed the decision and tried to bring an appeal against it. " I believe that a second court sees the matter a completely different way is unlikely, " said the Ufo CEO, Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Regional Labour Court in Frankfurt to have the status of the UFO as a union reviewed in court. The company argues that the union has not set up a board Board as a representative for months and is thus unable to fulfil its role as a gaining partner.
This was preceded by a violent leadership dispute in the division trade union, during which numerous members of the executive board and the advisory board resigned, including the long time trade union leader Nicoley Baublies. Due to doubts about its leadership, the Ufo had suspended an already started vote on cabin staff strikes at Eurowings at the end of July.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet. However, this is now about to change. The country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists with a new visa system in the future. The payers of the international and domestic visitors be increased to 100 million visitors a year by 2030, according to the tourism commission.
" The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is an historic moment for our country, " said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is so far hardly accessible for tourists. Visas are usually only awarded for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch conservative kingdom hopes to receive more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones hit two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the largest oil-refinery in the Abkaik and the Churai oil field. In this consequence, national oil production fell dramatically,, oil oil price gges soup. It should take several weeks before the kingdom's oil production returned to its old level.

Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also the causes of the threat, the IUCN International Confor Conservation reported in Brussels in Friday. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species that are known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265 species, 58 per cent are endangered. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories: from " potentially endangered, " to " endangered " " endangered, " " endangered, " " " and " incincin nature, " to " extinct. " Overall, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species as endangered worldwide.
rowan and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, especially rowans (sorbus) are threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. " Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by transforming or weakening their habitats. "
It also looks bad for the wild, common horse chestestnuts. They have been regarded as " endangered " since 2017, level two on the IUCN scale. The greatest threat threat is be the Balkan miner motte besides a a fungus. Since the 1980s, it has spread from from-eastern Europe all across the Europe and hardly has any natural enemies. The IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum in Europe) to less than 10,000 specimens. This assessment does not look at the trees that to the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Shrub species and mosses also in danger
The IUCN scientists have also compilup new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of the molluscs and mosses and almost half of all species of shrubs are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
" This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, which form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet, " said Mr. Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europe OffOffice. " We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority. "
Earthquake in front of Istanbul: 34 injured reported
34 people were injured in the most recent earthquake in Turkey. According to the data, there were no deaths. Dozens of people should have left their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the earthquake the day previous there had been almost 200 aftershocks. The earthquake of magnititude 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region in Istanbul and triggered panic in the million metropolis.
Now the government wants to establish a commission, to prepare the country better for earthquakes in future, announced Oktay. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly earthquake risk to earthquake. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate.
One of the most severe quakes was one of a magnitude of 7.ude near Istanbul in 1999. The epicenter was located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
On Tuesday, an earthquake with a magnitude 4.6 shook the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the residents to stay away from damaged buildings.

Fight against declining spectators
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you have dropped audience numbers: in February February the spectacle in the USA attracted the least viewers in more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
For the half time show of the last eding Super Bowl there had been rimotion: In the dispute about handling quarterback Colin Kaepernick, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and CarCardi B would not appear last February. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 was leading the half time show - the reviews were still not friendly.
Kaepernick, then the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had fallen to his knees in the 2016 / 17 season before the NFL games at the national Anthem in protest against the police violence and racism. His protest caused Kaick Kaepernick a move, numerous players took the gesture. This caused a great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African-American football stars strongly. Kaepernick himself is not-united since March 2017 and has no longer tested an NNFL game. He accuses the clubs not to want to hire him for political reasons.
Cook bankruptcy: hotels get money from the insurance company
According to a press release, some banks will cost cost the bankruptcy of travel provider Thomas Cook. There are be high write-offs on outstanding bonds and loans. This will also affect Credit Suisse, writes the " Financial Times " in Friday's issue.
According to the report, banks as Morgan Stanley, Barclays UniCredit and Credit Suisse would have to make a total of a total depreciation of up to £1.8 billion (around €2 billion) on their books, according to estimates by the consulting firm AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept depreciation of 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the lenders between £550 and 825 million. The amounts actually to be written off are likely to rather be at the upper end of the bandwidths, an expert told the paper.
How big the losses of the two creditors will actually be will show after the expend of insolvency proceedings. A person close to this procedure did not radiude too much hope. In Britain, for example, Thomas Cook's approx. 40 aircraft are " old " and many of the properties are in bad locations. It is likely that the most money is most money with the sale of the airport of the Thomas Cook slots and the Thomas Cook.
Rackete has brought alleged murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed in Libya. " We cannot rule out this, but we have no reliable information about it, " said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators have been arrested in the reception centre in Messina, in Italy. Neugebauer emphasized that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. " They come without passports. "

USA warn federal government of Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great, " Pai told to " Handelsblatt " with a view to the development of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a " national security law " that obliges every company " under Chinese jurisprudence " to obey the instructions of the security agencies.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, " said the FCC CEO, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal government agreed meanwhile to demand from suppliers a " declaration of trustworthiness. "
Berlin initially wanted to try to control the risks, for example by means of technical solutions, reports the " Handelsblatt, " citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
Especially the software is important for keeping the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, " Pai said.
It would be " very difficult to imagine " that a government agency, " no matter where, would be able to check each individual update in real time in order to track down security risks, " said the FCC chief.
He accuses the Chinese concern Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership conditions are opaque. The employee company, which allegedly owns the company, is not necessarily independent of the government, " Pai told the " Handelsblatt. "
The US was presented with findings according to which government employees were placed within the company. Pai recently recently held talks in Berlin to promote the US position.
Chemical Factory in the North of France Burns: Schools Closed
During the night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic wall of fire illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and crèches in the region will remain closed.
The responsible prefecture announced that the institutions would not open on a precon Friday, the preprefecture said. The Interior Ministry had asked the citizens, to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to smoke. There were no injured. Farmers and farmers were called upon to bring their animals inside, to protect their food, and stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire could be extinguished on Thursday evening, according to the Prefecture. There was still a risk of odor spreading after the cancellation, according to the Prefecture on Twitter. According to the Prefecture, 240 firefighters as well as 90 police and gendarmes were deployed on the fire.
A gigantic black smoke column had ascended from the chemical factory before. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of Lubrizol, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, there was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BBFMTV that it was initially no " high toxicity " in detected in samples.. a pollution ination of the Seine could not be ruled out. dams had been built in the river against the pollution, explained the prefecture.

French Finance Minister: " Germany must invest now "
The French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany has to invest now, the sooner the better, " said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The eurozone economy is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation gets worse to make the necessary decisions. "
Those states that have budgetary scope for more investment will have to act, said Le Maire, among other things with regard to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the minister added, pointing to the high public debt of his country. This is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French public debt must be " stabilized " and " lowered, " said Le Maire.
In recent years, there have been repeated appeals from France to Germany to make more public investment to reviulate the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to cope with its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is reacting, among other things, to the protests led by the Yellow Vest movement. New borrowing is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to the expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson avoids question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticises the " Law on Capitulation " passed by Parliament.
The parliament is back, a law prescribes the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics fear however, that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Asked for this possibility, but the Tory politician evids.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is scried about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the most law recently passed by parliament, which is supposed to prevent that. To answer a question, Johnson has told journalists that only his government abide by current law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a " surrender law, " which makes the negotiations with EU difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suspected on Thursday, that Johnson could try to employ " political assassment to bypass the law. The prime minister could employ a procedural trick that would delay the law's entry into force to the time after leaving the EU. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. " We are optimistic to leave the EU on 31 October and and the best way is to proceed with an agreement. "
Johnson's chief adviser Dominic told Cummings meanwhile that he felt the political conflicts over the Brexit a " walk in the park, " and he himself confident that the desired ed to leave the EU will still come about: " We enjoy that, we will win, we will leave (ed: exit from the EU), don't worry, " said Cummings told the British newspaper TelTelegraph at a book presentation.

The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera Linda McCartarney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't have to be the great glamour. The photo book " The Polaroid Diaries " (bags) immerves deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the photo book " The Polaroid Diaries " in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Other illustrious guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison, and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: " # ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary pre-Instagram family, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film. "
The camera was always with Linda McMcCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found her way in photography. She has made thousands of Polaroids, a few hundred of them are now being published in The Polararoid Diaries.
There are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s up to the late 90s. " She wanted real moments, " writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course, one always always stands in the center: her husband Paul - as you have never seen him before.
He dances with his little daughter Mary on the shoulder, telephoning in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wearing misshapen Moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but led beyond the spotlight light on her farm in southern England or in Scotland also led a very normal life. So Mary McCartney ney according to the BBC, that she had slept in a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And with the McCartneys it has not always been titidy.
The Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment like hardly any other medium. Linda McCartney's pictures are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to shoot it at exactly the right moment, " said McCartney. " If you shoot it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo. " And Linda would have had the ability to capture exactly the right moment. " She just knew she had it, " said Paul in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the picture section and the colors are right there, which makes " The Polaroid Diaries " not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but is, besides all the anecdotals, also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes sometimes sometimes look like abstract paintings. The perfect complement to the just newly released Beatles album " Abbey Road " which was released exactly 50 years ago.
" We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran "
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from its neighboring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop the import of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, " said Erdogan in New York, where he had part in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems in importing Iranian petroleum, as some companies had " withdrawn because of the US threats. "
Nevertheless, Turkey will " continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues, " said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its abanditation from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of " maximum pressure " on the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran is secretly following a nuclear program and is not obto the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to a slump in Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. Tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably in recent months.
US government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically limit the intake of refugees. The US State Department declared on Thursday that the annual limit of a refugee resettlement program should be reduced from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, with a cut rate of 40 percent.
The State Department declared that although the US is still committed to supporting refugees. However,, the most important task is to protect and serve serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is burdened.
The US government wants to focus on hosting two groups of refugees: people who are being persecuted because of their beliefs and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as to by the declaration of the State Department. contrast, they want to accept a maximum of 1,500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The program, established in 1980, will select refugees from UN camps around the world and be resettled in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the budget-year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. The current limit of 30,000 is a basest value. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was almost 85,000.
Aid agencies were appalled by the recently announced reduction of the ceiling. " This is a very sad day for the US, " said the head of the International Rescue Committee David MiliMiliband who would further damage the US leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to restrict immigration to the US - both legally and illegally. According to its data, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - " Coming close to a spy "
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers in the whistleblower affair of espionage; whoever has given corresponding evidence to the informant who accuses him of an abuse of power " comes close to a spy, " Trump said according to a record of a private event in Thursday in New York. Several US media have reported this this.
According to this Trump spoke to employees of the UN mission. When he asked the person who informed the whistlebleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied: " That comes close to a spy. " Then Trump added: " You know what we were doing in ancient times when when when we were clever? Correctly. The spies and betrayal we used to deal with it a little differently than we are doing now. "
The Democrats sharply criticized Trump's statements, and accused him of intimidating witnesses, including an attempt to hinder a congressional investigation into possible impeachment against him, wrote the chairmen of the External Affairs, Secret Intelligence and Supervisory committees in the House of Representatives.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a now published complaint of having abused his office to ask for interference of another country in the US election in 2020. Specifically, it is all about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selensky in the summer: In the conversation, Trump advised him to initiate investigations against his possible Democratic challenger Joe-BiBiden and his son Hunter in the Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower himself and its informants are. " However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst of the CIA.

Rental suddenly discontinued: WeWork makes real estate tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from a small startup to a driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords must fear for billions in revenue.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to break the balance balance down in the world's biggest real estate markets company. A few days ago, company company had founder Adam Neumann as as boss, postponed the planned public IPO, and with the sale of subsidiaries and values like the private private jet for executive managers in order to gain financial scope for the coming weeks and months. In, among other things, British " Financial Times " reports that WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect. Suis suddenly the the market, the largest tenant of office space in New York and London.
WeWork leases large office space in the long-term and rents them at short notice in some small units to members. This can be individual freelancers, small starstartups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork burns with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year the company made a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs through the rental of new large areas should have risen to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars increased. To narrow down the loss, the new management is now have pulled the emergency brakes and stopped the renting of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with maturities of up to 15 years, creating commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could be a problem not only for the company and its investors, but for entire property markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhatten, one of the most expensive property markets in the world, has rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space space in the past 24 months. WeWorks alone alone, new contracts have that the demand for New York offices in the larger than the new space at that time. Without Without expansion, the office vacancies in the US metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in the " Business Insider. " The same is the case in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in the best locations.
In the British capital, too, the balance in the property market could be felt without a further expansion of the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is main tenant in the center of the financial capital in an office building bought last year by the savings bank provider Deka, for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties with high investments for the requirements of WeWork. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable very soon, the real estate owners would probably have to write off a part of the hoped-for billionons ons WeWork. They do not have access to the anyway - reserves anyway - reserves despite the long-term rental contracts contracts Because the leasing of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by-founded subsidiaries, so called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only within tight limits.
Russia once again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen

New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people once again want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again plans actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. The start is due to the time difference in New Zealand and in Australia before the protests spread across Europe to North America, where climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
It is relatively unclear how great the worldwide response will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week. Thunberg himself was good things. " Last Friday, over four million people on strike for the climate. This Friday, we will do it again! " she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been some 6383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
Especially in Germany the infludance was very large last Friday. A very good third of all worldwide demonstrators - about 1.4 million - participated, according to estimates of Fridays for Future in 575 German cities. According to a list of the movement, rallies in 65 cities are at least being planned. Among them in metropolitan cities like Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities like Jüchen in North North Rhine Rhine WestWestWestWestWestWestWestWestWesterland Sylt people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the time, 15 years old, Thunberg sat down to the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of their country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. From this, the days for the future movement emerged within a short, short time. The climate protests are mainly attended by students and students, but increasingly also by scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more politicians politicians more ambition in the fight against global heating and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, the level of global warming must be reduced to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived in New York almost a month ago after a two-week transatlantic-cruise with a high-sea racing yacht. There, she last participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave emotional a speech at the UN in which she spoke ently ently to the leaders and government of the world. In her own home country, Stockholm, she was awarded the Nobel Prize Alternative Prize of the Right Livelood Foundation on Wednesday for more climate livelihood.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. which provides for a change in fire protection. " This also applies to smoking, " said a spokesspokesman for the Ministry of Emergency in Moscow on Thursday agency Tass. The ban is due to come into force on 1 October.
Who smokes nevertheless, must therefore have a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros) expect. If the cigarette should ignite a fire, then the penalty is higher.. Under the ban, also also burning candles, according to the Ministry. Also, to grill meat skewers on the balcony is no longer permitted.
Blow against cybercriminals - Investigators lift out servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time identified a large server provider for illegal transactions in the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted as operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-the Trarbach on the Moselle numerous websites about which internationally active criminals conducted their machinations.
This was announced by the Attorney General's office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a major action, the Darknet a shielded part of the Internet.
The suspected suspects customers are said to have been the operators of the world's the second largest Darknet marketplace for drugs, " Wall Street Market " - investigators had destroyed it in the spring. According to the Attorney's office at the end of November 2016, the attack on 1.25 million telecom-routers was also controlled via a server in the cyber bunker.
Such a hoster had been excavated in Germany for the first time, it was said. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access action with the support of special forces like the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people once again want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-WestphalWestWestor Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist, Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada.
Who are Thunberg's backers actually?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more astonishing that a 16-16-old girl of all things holds the nose of the mirror of the the power man of this time. But what is it behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand GreGreThunberg berg sets the masses in motion and causes young people to up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win over a collection of children and young people for himself. As early as in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt he was chosen to work for a more er world. At that time he could also win over a crowd of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea in order to get into the promised land, similar as Greta Thunberg has recently made on a journey to America with a sailboat.
But is there a dark side in this regard? Why does it need a share " We don't have time " to save the world? In addition, the Greta-Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. Incidentally, she has published a book which has sold far-reaching, thanks to the daughter standing in the spotlight. Also the well-tried followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant at the last PR show, or rather the trip with the boat was probably too much ly some on some some. This is also not unfounded, because the action came very well in the media around the world and there is a great deal of money thanks to the imposing action.
Here the spirits are now divided: Is it morally correct to enrich yourself financially while saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of persons work together with stock brobrokers during the world rescue campaign? Regardless of which position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected view is ever more important in a democratically shaped society, because the democracy still lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can also make sense to critically question seemingly pious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A foreign comet is crossing our solar system at the moment.
The astronomers' conjectures are confirmed: At the moment, a foreign comet is crosthrough our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - The researchers have long suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet coming by another star crosthrough our solar system at the moment. It was nicknamed after its discoverer 2I / Borisov and currently employs astronomers around the world.
2I / Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow in Crimea. He looked towards the sky with a self-built telescope and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to was seen during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get from-close glimpses into a foreign solar system. Apparently, it is similar to those of our own system, as the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands reports. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbic orbit that takes it out of our system.
Comet was sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it comes so time, the astronomers can observe it in detail because, unlike its predecessor, 2I / BorBorisov has already been seen in its approach, which means that it can be examined from the Earth for months. " " The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and can then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020, " explains Davide Davide Farnocchia from US space agency Nasa. " After October 2020, it will then only be observed with larger professional telescopes and copes. "
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 " Oumuamua. "
First findings on comet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to our comet. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could be themselves by similar processes as in our, added de Leóns colleague Javier Licandro.
The observation goes beyond individual knowledge, however. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within a mere two years, may allows a new way to the investigation of certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again, asteroids are occupying the researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid raced past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
" Absolutely reprehensible ": Rachel Johnson horrified by brother
Around Boris Johnson it becomes more lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister is chascourating with clear words the prime minister's warlike language as " tasteless. " It is not the only brother she knows.
" Capitulation, " " Frauyal, " Treaty ": Prime Minister Boris is Johnson under pressure pressure and keeps to ming up - at least verbally speaking. At Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday this faced massive outrage from the opposition, and now other critics have given their voices: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother was using words like capitulation, as if opponents of an EU exit should be " hanged, drawn out, quarged, quartered, paved and feended. " She thinks this is extremely reectionsible. She does not recognize her brother's version, said Rachel Johnsons, who had run to the EU Parliament for " Change UK, " anti-Brexit party.
She especially stumbled upon the fact that Jo Cox mentioned her brother Jo Cox, a pro-EU member of MP who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi just a few days before the 2016 referendum in. Their memory could be the best best in memory by going through the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House. " It is very tasteless to refer himself to an MEP who was killed by someone who shouted' Britain first', " criticized Johnson's son. He ently, he he, the prit to had come from the far-right camp who felt " bolstered by this kind of language. " He said it was very tasteless for all those who mourned her.
The Cox widow ard also strongly criticized the Prime Minister. " It makes me sick when Jo's name is used in this way, " he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to you paspassionand resolively advocup for what you believe in in no matter what view you take., But one should never " demonize the other side. " He also complained that an atmosphere had been created in which attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Bori's younger brother Jo had resigned office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MEate. " In recent months, I have been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest - it is an insoluble tension, " said Jo Johnson justified the move.
Johnson's language was also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As reported by the Times Times, the 118 bishops ops ops ops ops ops of the Church of England criticize language that is " not worthy of this country. In a joint statement, they stated: " In the days, both the language, both in debates and and of parliament, has been unacceptable. We should speak to each other with respect. "

Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a Super Bowl appearance - including Rihanna, and Pink. Many people ultimately criticized the performance of the rock group Maroon-5.
An actor and Youtuber is Egypt's ruler: however, for the time being, Mohamed Ali preferred to stay abroad.
The two men who influence on whether blood is flowing again on the streets of Egypt, have spent the two last week abroad. One both of them floated again at the Cairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-SSisi returned from the United Nations General Assembly-General, who who removed the Muslim Brother Mohamed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, in the year 2013, spent a pleasant time spent in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's political action against Islam, and no sysyllllables about human rights violations in to the Nile in a week in which Egyptian security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president. " He " no reason, " said Sisi at the airport, to watch the TV television one of the state's micromicrophone. " The Egyptians do not let themselves in the aken. "
According to the president, this is the attempt of the other man, who currently determines the happening on the streets. " Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he withaway from the grip of the security forces, who would arrest him immediately when he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weekweeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor by a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafes, the living rooms and tea rooms: With his YouTube channel, " Mohamed's secrets, " " Ali calls his countrymen to stand up against Sisi.
He approaches the head of state directly and in a very very rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president wallow in luxury and allow himself to build magnificent new palaces, it is said: " The army of the, on which Sisi bases his rule, is accused of corruption and enrichment. Because in his second profession as a developer made business with exactly these gentlemen for 15 years, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of so many Egyptitians, as the almost exploding numbers of click show.
After last week for the first time since Sisi's grip on power, the thousands had demonstrated against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a " millions of march " for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would really venture are the streets. However, there were some smaller protests, for example, in Giza near Cairo and Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests, whose participants accused of corruption Al-Sisi and demanded his departure. In the occasion of these tests, the police also put tear-gas and rubber bullets. These videos could not first be verified independently verified. From security circles said that the police had finished the prosters.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters last week would tear banners with the portrait of the president were reported on Friday, massive police presence.

If the provider promises too much
If the Internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
Anyone conclusigns an Internet contract does not need to blindly trust the speed specifications of the provider. In case of abnormalities, customers can check themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
After all, the previously promised transmission rates are part of the contract and should therefore be achieved, explains the consumer association Bayern.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing possibilities. Thus the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
" The tests of the offerers take place however according to offeror specific requirements and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated, " says the consumer center Bavaria to consider on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable time limit of usually 14 days to produce the promised service. Affected persons do best in writing by en@-@ ment letter.
If this does nothing even after several requests, customers can terminate and possibly also claim damages. However, with lack of success, only the action will help.

Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Allegedly Jaqueline Ng had been promised an upgrade from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked at the check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.

On the return flight, the employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although she had had an email in which Cathay Pacific allegedly promised an upgrade. She is claiming the influencer to have received the letter from an airline marketing employee. However, the airline accuses Jaéqueline of forging the mail.
On the return flight Jaququeline again tried to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time the woman is supposed to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were sceptical: they hooked at the headquarters. And, in, the employee, from whom the mail allegedly originated, is supposed to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was confirmed by the mail system in which the messages did not appear.

Moreover, the conditions of the airline state that she does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline will not be satisfied with it - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices decline after report on ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar in Friday in a very short time. Most recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea type Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price of a barrel of the American type of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.

The sense and the prospects of such a meeting are questionable due to lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday according to the agency KCNA.
The US has so far done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit in last year, said the adviser of the North Korean State Department Department.

British pounds under pressure
With interest rates lowering in the near future, the pound is losing its value against the euro.
Frankfurt Speculation on an early interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) is putting the pound sterling. The British currency disdown on Friday Friday by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269.
The sales were triggered by remarks by the central banker Michael Saunders. This brought a interest rate cut into the conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted because the uncertainty will affect the British economy in the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, since Saunders considered as an advocate of a restrictive monetary policy said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the brokage house ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy from the Brexit hickack without directly signaling a interest rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country from the EU on 31 October, if necessary without a divorce agreement.

Doping: Further Russian manipulations proven
Material from the Moscow analytical laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and current head of integrity of the World Athletics Federation.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details on the doping scandal in Russia come to light - and they destroy the little in credibility that the Russian sport had regained and and only only only in the, at the beginning of the year. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-German Doping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they had been fake.
In December 2014, systematic systematic fraud in Russian sports had revealed. Thereupon the Wada had blocked the Russian Anti-doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After individual examination in 2016 the International Olympic Committee at the Olympic Rio Olympic International Olympic Committee let about 270 athletes of the country compete under a neutral flag, at the Winter Games in February 2018 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were also present at the World Cups in the various sports, in the summer the sooccer World Cup took place with the host as a participant.
Positive findings are absent
The following September the Wadada lifted the Rusada-ban again, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data were supposed to give some information about the extent of the cover-up of doping cases during state doping. They were supposed to help to punish athletes men and women afterwards. They were finally delivered three months later.
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity-Commission (AIU) of the International World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analytical laboratory have been manipulated. " Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task-Force received the correct data, " said David Howman in an interview with the " Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung " on Friday. " We have found a lot of discrepancy between the data that the Wada from a whistlebleblower and and those it received from the RussiRusin January. " " Many positive findings were missing, which were mentioned in the McLaren report.
World Cup
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organization to stick to the spell of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes Russian athletes under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week the Wada had already put manipulations in space and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the renewed suspension of the Rusada and, in the worst case, also the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
