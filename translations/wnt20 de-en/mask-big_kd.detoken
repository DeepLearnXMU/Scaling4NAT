Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, considered particularly dangerous is extinguished, according to the Normandy Prefecture on Friday. The fire broke out on the night after Thursday. Nobody was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in action with around 200 fire engines.
The fire stopped
Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work in the plant. The chemical factory already made headlines in the past - for example, when the gas of methanthiol escaped through a leak in 2013 and the environment smelled widely of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system after an industrial accident.
Woman quits her job to look for her missing bitch for 57 days
For two months a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and quit her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had run out of the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. Any trace of the bitch was missing for 57 days - but Carole King did not give up.
" It was terrible. I got sick, " Carole King told the " Daily Inter Lake. " She and her husband had left female Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. Afterwards, when they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but to no avail.
Thunder panicked dog
Hoping that Katie could still be somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. " The employee says, " She left about four or four and a half hours ago, " " Carole King realls " Daily Inter Lake. " When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie immediately immediately. Presumably, a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But days turned into weeks. " I've never given up. I've never lost hope, " Carole King told Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal clerk to continue her search for Katie.
" The tears flowed "
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a phone call: a man came forward and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King got there, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch was standing under a tree. " I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go, " King recalled loudly " Daily Inter Lake. " " The tears flowed. People stopped in her vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her. "
Bundeswehr's losses: machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday September 27th, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the whereabouts are unclear. The opposition speaks of a " frightening " extent.
Weapons and ammunition are repeatedly disappearing in the Bundeswehr - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is the result of a classified list classified by the Federal Ministry of Defence, on which the editorial network Germany reports.
According to the paper from the office of Defense Secretary of State Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, a weapon part and 3,474 rounds of ammunition have reappeared. The still missing weapons and weapon parts include six MG3 machine guns, eleven G3 rifles, four G36 rifles, six signal guns and two P8 pistols. In addition, 30 tubes for MG3 machine guns are missing.
The extent of arms and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr is " frightening, " said Martina Renner, a member of the left-wing Bundestag. This is all the more true because hardly anything has been found in the course of investigations. Left politician's politician spoke of a " poor balance sheet. " Renner criticized that the list did not show whether there was the one among the missing ammunition that had been found in connection with the investigation of the terror-suspected federal defense officer Franco A. A. " And this even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of possessing this ammunition, " said Renner.
Stena Impero oil tanker left Iranian port
More than two months after its arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas this Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set off and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates was indicated as the destination port.
The tanker had actually already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but at first it remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said that they wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
The " Stena Impero " had been caught on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on charges of having violated safety regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran reacted to the controversial, temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar belonging to Great Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil export is shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to the Courage of the People in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel paid tribute to the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, of the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. " State Security was deprived of its horror, " she said.
Musk seeks record
Tesla's quarter may hold a record. Despite the delivery boom, the electric car group has recently suffered losses.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. " We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, " Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek. "
The demand was strong, so Tesla could place 110,000 orders, Musk's newsletter continued. The challenge was to bring the cars to customers quickly. To do this, Tesla had to raise as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares left trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not risen so strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 9,5,000 cars and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 4000,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures are needed in the current and next quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were recent losses.
Solved puzzles: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from being able to tickle themselves. Scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress had also been made on the question of why children defend themselves so strongly against tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it was also shown why the approach of a tickling hand alone triggers laughter before the touch. This is due to a deep layer in the cerebrum, which already causes laughter in the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with " laughter " in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans. This " laughter " is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during contact
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and contact by others - which is why humans cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out in the experiments on the rats that laughter as well as the activity of the respective area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during self-contact. This is also so when living beings clean themselves. However, during the foreign contact and tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh were intensified.
However, if self-contact and contact by others occur at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the rat's brain cannot distinguish between self-contact and touch by others. The new findings suggested that humans cannot tickle themselves because self-contact activates a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Accordingly, they sometimes broke off this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showed escape behaviour or rigidity. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioural reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Catastrophe averted: French chemical plant extinguished fire extinguished
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished, as Normandy Prefecture told the AFP news agency on Friday, which broke out on the night of Thursday.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances leaked. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. Noone was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was used with around 200 fire engines.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to Lubrizole by US billionaire Warren Buffett
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizl by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements. Around 400 people work in the plant.
The chemical factory already made headlines in the past - for example, when the gas methanthiol escaped through a leak in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system after an industrial accident.
Brexit: Johnson criticised by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session in Parliament after the lifting of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU on 31 October without an agreement if Brussels does not get involved in his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, how he intends to achieve this is unclear.
About Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: " The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and reunite this country would be to leave the EU. " Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Memorial to Oslo and Utöya attacks is unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honour of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument " Jernrosene " (German: the iron roses) consists of around 1,000 iron rose replicas. They commemorate the roses that thousands of people had laid arded in front of the cathedral in Oslo in the days and weeks following the attacks.
The project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be unveiled at the same location - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit, among others, are expected to attend the opening.
On 22 July 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first detonated a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and subsequently shot dozens of participants in a summer camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party on the island of Utöya. A total of 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tanker
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one problem problem. The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " detained in Iran was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero, " trapped in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since the middle of July, is back in international waters. After approval by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The " Stena Impero " has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, explained shipping company manager Erik Hånell. Around noon the ship had left the Iranian waters. " Nice that it is over, " he told the Swedish TV station SVT.
The State Department in London described the ship's fixing as illegal. " This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the oceans. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law, " a statement said on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker on 19 July on charges of violviolthe regulations of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. Hånell said that the remaining 16 crew members were doing well in accordance with the circumstances. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and exhaueling situation over the past ten weeks. The shipping company was now working to reunite them with their families as quickly as possible.
The British government suspected behind the arrest of " Stena Impero " a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: at the beginning of July a super tanker with oil from Iran, which was allegedly destined for Syria, was put on the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of " piracy " and threatened consequences. In mid-August, the " Adrian Darya-1 " was finally released. London vehemently rejected assumptions that it was a barter to free the " Stena Impero. "
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil export are shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US single-handedly left the international nuclear deal, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb while ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to enforce a stricter agreement extended to other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Due to the Stena Impero dispute, and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf, and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
At the UN General Assembly in New York, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz. With the " Coalition of Hope " for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protpowers, wanted to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India's protectionist economic policies are building a better future.
India would be predestined to become a " war profiteer. " Given the punitive tariffs imposed by America's President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are compelled to rearrange. Asian firms " financial chtives considering moving their production from China to another country cite India as one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. But this has not only to do to the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war. With a huge pool of young labor and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be made to play a more significant role in the vast global production chain.
But now India itself has come into Trump's focus. Dejoratively dubbed by the White House as the " Kingdom of Tariffs, " America withdrew trade benefits for 2,000 products from the emerging economy in early June, with the US accusing India of prohibitively high tariffs and demanding better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, of course, friction with India is merely a sideshow. Moreover, America also views the world's largest democracy through security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington are linked by concerns about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a volley of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra-Modi, who has just started a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh himself.
The problem, however, lies in another place: the empirically corroborated thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development has a difficult time in the socialist Republic of India. Even under modes. Its zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies now receive building permits for buildings faster. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more tanchy insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for liquidating apparently dead companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has changed for the better in India in the first five modes years. However, this does not apply in trade policy. Inspired by protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign providers, the national conservative government even erected new barriers.
In the West, Modi is the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country economically, and this impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows very well what vocabulary Western managers like. Essentially, however, the " India First " lawyer never moved away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the isolation of their industries are among the regular voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.

The competitors finish: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The top of the world had long been at the finish when heartwarming scenes took place in the cooled down Khalifa International Stadium. Jonathan-Busby from Aruba began to sway dangerously in the first preliminaries of the men over 5000 meters. He could hardly stay on his feet a good 300 meters from the finish, ran in an unhealthy bent ure, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly hooked him him and dragged him supporting the last half stadium round to the finish. However, the forces of both were still enough to stop the wristwatch after the finish line. As if the scene had not been curious enough.
" I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same, " Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. Shy he dodged, did not want to talk about his exploit at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he should not even have started. " That's why I'm proud to run here for my country, " he said.
He did so emphevening ously that evening - and much more intensively than he would have thought. Because this heroic feat will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even let his competitor Busby take the finish and voluntarily took over the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this preliminaries. In the end, it was useless, because Busby, who had only crossed the finish line with a lot of help, was disqualified by the World Light Athletics Association in the end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, competed to set a personal best at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this succeeded with 18: 10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: " I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes. " However, only in training, best times do not count.
Millions of mash: Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, the security measures have been strengthened in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. An increased police presence could be observed in the center of Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, the police had already stepped up their road checks and partly searched pedestrians' mobile phones for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend there were protests with hundreds of participants participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whom critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. There had not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. Egyptian contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who lived in exile in Spain and who started the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a " march of the millions " in central places in the country Friday Friday Ali calls for a " people's revolution. " For most young Egyptians, the man is not a " good man because he raised millions as a subcontractor for the army, but his messages arrive.
According to two observer groups, the number of arrests in connection with the protests increased. By Friday, the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests, and the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures could not be confirmed independently at N, the government confirmed or commented on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were " arbitrarily arrested " " just because they were' in the wrong place at the wrong time', " HRW said, citing lawyers of those arrested. According to their lawyers, the charges against the detainees range from " dissemination of misinformation " to membership in a " terrorist association. " In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, also arbitrarily interviewed and searched by passers-by according to HRW.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services in order to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: mail-order retailers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the waste. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way that they can donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies cannot be exempted from VAT on donations in kind, the ministry explained on a question of the Green parliamentary group, about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, the retailers could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they had to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens send back every sixth package when placing orders on the Internet. Subsequently, around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - ended up in the waste. According to the current legal situation, it would cost companies money to donate them, because the tax authorities assess donations in kind, such as a turnover, which would then incur VAT.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies cannot evaluate products available for sale accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies should be able to rely on them not to be punished for donations. This applies not only to online trade, but also to other businesses from fashion damage to the hardware store.
Banksy art auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, " Devolved Parliament, " is to be auctioned off soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines " the regression of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic attitude shaped by animals and tribes. " From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned off on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in the south-west of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had exhibited the painting again - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work, formerly called " Question Time, " was renamed " Devolved Parliament. "
The picture could change hands for a million amount.
Most recently, at the first meeting of the House of Commons on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had engaged in a tough blows with the opposition opposition following the Supreme Court's lifting of a forced break imposed by Johnson. Johnson wants to carry out Brexit, which has already been postponed, on 31 October without an agreement with the EU if necessary.
This is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture of a man breaking a European flag star with a chisel. Thousands of truck drivers and other visitors see the work every day when entering the UK.
Brexit debate is like " walking in the park "
According to his top advisor, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fierce verbal attacks on opponents of Brexit in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a " walk in the park, " Dominic Cummings said at a book launch on Friday. " We enjoy it. We will leave (the EU) and we will win. "
Johnson had harshly attacked opponents of Brexit in parliament in recent days, accusing them, among other things, of " betraying " the people. He dismissed accusations that he could put MPs at risk because they could become the target of death threats as a " humbug. "
Cummings said the only way to calm calm is for MEPs to finally respect the British decision to leave the EU. Not surprisingly, people are upset that Britain still hadn't left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. " We should talk to each other with respect, " it said in a statement. " And we should also listen. "
Pakistani Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, during his first appearance before the UN General Assembly, once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN general debate in New York. " If that goes badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst. " The United Nations has a responsibility for Kashmir. " You should have prevented that. "
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate one part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn the Indian Kashmir region's status of autonomy and thus abruptly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of Egyptian President Sisi.
The government is reacting to the current protests in Egypt with a hard hand. It uses live ammunition to shoot at the population, and than 2,000 detainees join the 60,000 political prisoners in prisons who are already imprisoned there. Protesting has never been harmless in Egypt. However, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything it can to avoid a scenario like in the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by their own government drove millions onto the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get a grip on, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who it finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the biggest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was even before el-Sisi. The Egyptian people have a lot of experience with authoritarian regimes, and the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It becomes critical whenever large parts of the population have difficulties to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv checks in the terminal: BER boss: No more " show stoppers " for capital airport
It was checked for two months whether the complicated mesh of plants works in conjunction with BER fire protection. Operators are satisfied with the course of events. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Chairman of the Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed examination, but also said that there are still shortcomings to be addressed in the terminal. " We have many detailed topics, but we do not have a real showstopper. " He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve is no longer likely to be too large. The construction notice is now to be submitted to the building authority in the course of the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables still need to be remedied; the Tüv intends to examine them by February. " In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work must continue to be done to deal with the deficiencies, " said a written notice.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about the lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all dowels on which the cable routes hang. The airport manager expects that this will be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time, it is about smoke aprons, which shut down like a screen in a fire so that the smoke does not spread. They run down. Therefore, 36 engines have to be replaced. Then, there will be new tests with hot gas fluumes at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Since construction began in 2006, the costs have risen from two billion to around 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. This is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October will be about, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. CFO Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR Director Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put airport finances on a firm footing.
Chemnitz: Vending machines for drugs blown up - police arresting man
He needed money for drugs - and blew up several machines in the city of Chemnitz! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
In the past two years, the number of blown up cigarette and parking ticket vending machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply.
After two detonations at the end of May, the police grabbed a 33-year-old German on Bu ¼ rgerstraße and on Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: " In the course of the investigation into causing explosive explosions in a unit with a particularly serious case of theft, which was conducted by the Chemnitz Criminal Police, not only this suspicion 33-year-old was confirmed. "
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: " With the booty he apparently financed his narcotic dependence. " The bomber had blown up parking ticket machines on Bu � rgerstraße four times alone between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60 000 euros!
The vending machine bomber is now in custody. Police investigations against him continue.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further blasting in Chemnitz and neighbouring counties.
AUA Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is turning its strategy upside down for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over " the commercial management of all Eurowings flights from Vienna, " a press spokesman for Austrian Airlines confirmed APA on Friday. " AviationNetOnline " had previously reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will thus be de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. From January 2020, AUA will take over in the " Wetlease, " i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, explained the spokesperson. Flight times are to be tailored to connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and on the other hand to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a " production company " for the company's sister AUA. Barcelona and Rome, for example, would be operated with an AUA flight number, but primarily with a Eurowings device. Although the on-board product is to be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights departing under AUA flight number are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but like the EQCH in Terminal 3.
A price war has broken out at Vienna Airport after the Niki bankruptcy. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that it would increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost aircraft is sending four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called " Wetlease, " which the union criticized as a bypass construction to the collective agreement.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's announcement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years was answered on Friday by AUA CEO Andreas Otto: " We will remain the number one at the site, in five, six or ten years. "
Queen Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four is getting married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: During the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have asked for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31), as the palace announced on Thursday.
" We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so excited to start this adventure together and can't wait to actually be married, " the couple, who have been together since October 2018, according to UK media reports, said in the official announcement.
And " We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years full of love and happiness. "
Sister Eugenie took pictures
Her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), took the official engagement photos - and also published them on her Instagram account.
Ein royales Fest
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information on the date, place and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
It is certain, however, that the marriage of the number nine of the succession to the British throne and the real estate mogul will be a similar celebration as the wedding of Eugenie with Jack Brooksbank (33) on 12 October 2018.
Study on Causes of Heart Disease
Smoking, obesity, an unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really causes heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9000 healthy and sick people.
By analysing the genetic material of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the High Mountain Hospital Davos, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the main influable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors help determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Cardiovascular Center at the UKE.
According to the hospital, possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - are currently known in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes. Every year, about 200 are added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. According to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Cardiovascular Center, the data could also be used in researinto other common diseases. New findings on the interaction between the heart and brain, the heart and kidney as well as on cancer are possible.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there is a firm will to use the data to investigate other diseases. So far, the Foundation's clinic in Davos has primarily dealt with allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be established on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics should be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics-based Switzerland entrepreneur said that he had undergone open heart surgery in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The organic samples from the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also take part in the " Hamburg City Health Study. " According to the hospital, this is the largest local health study in the world with 45,000 test persons. The scientists assured that strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymisized data in the decoding of genetic material. It is about one petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the genetic material of a human can be deciphered within 24 hours today. The pure material costs for this would amount to 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, still cost several hundred million euros. The study is to begin on 1 October, all 9,000 samples are expected to be analyzed by the end of 2020. Initial results are expected in the following year.
Nigerian police rescue hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Qur'school school. According to local residents, security forces searched the school in the Nigerian city of Qaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were still minors, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo reported. " The victims were abused, some of whom claimed to have been raped by their teachers, " Sabo said.
The boys were detained under the pretext of being taught and " repaired " in the Koran. In fact, the protégés were held by their teachers under " most degrading and inhumane conditions, " Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children at the age of nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran school had existed for about ten years. Residents had drawn the attention of the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. Parents were shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. According to the police, the operator and six employees were arrested.
In the predominantly Muslim schools of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighboring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria police free 400 children from school
Police officers freed nearly 400 students from appalling backgrounds in a school in northern Nigeria. " Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that ating torture, " said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
There, the children had been discovered on Thursday after a hint in an Islamic school. There, the conditions had been " inhumane. " The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, had been held at their school like slaves and chained, some of whom had been sexually abused. Television images showed emaciated and injured students in noticeably poor health.
World football election: Further accusations after Messis and Klopps freestyle
Football " Signature not valid "
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Association FIFA honors the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations come to FIFA from other countries. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious justification.
Much of FIFA has proven to be disreputable in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA world football election has so far not been suspected of going unclean - apart from the fact that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote according to sympathy, rather than to objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting schedule.
FIFA apologizes that " the signatures on the election forms were given in capital letters and therefore not valid. " The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan's coach also astonished
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio van Mané in third. According to FIFA, however, the vote was just as well, with signatures and the official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also made accusations: " I did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my vote is wrong, thank you, " he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
The association received the message on Friday: That's right, but of course was no intention. The completed election documents were " erroneously " provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was said in a message of the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas elected. " We take responsibility for the administrative error, " it said in the communication. However, both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte voted for Messi, " just as it says in the official list of FIFA. "
Fifa now has the other cases examined in an investigation, but stresses that the electoral process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world footballer election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans speak out for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly spoken out in favor of an official investigation against US President and colleague Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, " said Republican Governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. " Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that can be established. " He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. Impeachment proceedings can lead to the dismissal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the activities of Democratic President and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been observing Biden " for years. "
Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump for the whistleblower affair, and few have shown uncomfort about it. Scott's remarks are now a first sign of this in Trump's party, and the moderate governor of Virginia had already repeatedly Trump Trump's policies, such as easing ing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Another senior Republican was Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker who supported the investigation. " It's a deeply disturbing situation, " Baker said. " The right course of action and responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it. "
Scott and Baker, as governors of US states, have no formal say in the proceedings against Trump, which are decided in Congress. Therefore, their statements are primarily symbolically important. Nevertheless, first Republican senators have also been critical of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the Second Chamber of Representatives, said the case was " extremely disdisturbing, deeply disturbing. " US media also report that initial cracks are opening up among Republicans internally.
The affair could result to the opening of impeachment proceedings against Trump; the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, accusing him of abusing power for foreign interference for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could initia so-called impeachment. However, the decision on actual impeachment would fall in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have a majority. Thus, the chances of success of such a procedure are slim. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board Racketes " Sea Watch "?
Three men were arrested in Sicily and allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had illegally headed for the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship " Sea Watch 3 " and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After strong protests and international criticism - also from Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations are being made against Rackete. For example, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the " Sea-Watch 3. " The suspects were caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. " We cannot rule this out, but we have no reliable information on it ourselves, " said " Sea Watch " spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). " The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence, " the statement said at the time.
NGOs and aid organisations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. " We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports, " said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. " It is therefore very important that this is investigated. "
Italy's right-wing former Interior Minister, Matteo Salvini, immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
Musk strives for delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures.
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, " Musk wrote to Tesla employees in an email published by the industry blog " Electrek. "
Demand was strong, so that Tesla could place 110,000 orders, according to Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars to customers quickly. To do this, Tesla had to raise as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not risen so strongly for almost four months. Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit figures are needed in the current and next quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were recent losses.
US budget dispute: Again only bridge financing
In the United States, the new fiscal year will begin October 1 without a decent budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided to provide transitional funding by November 21.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again facing the new fiscal year beginning on October 1 without spending plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and passed a Continuing Resolution (CR) by November 21. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have occurred at midnight on Monday, a federal of the partially administration. President Trump has yet to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration is now being financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019, which will end on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 expenditure laws, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot benefit for the time being from the expenditure framework for the new financial year from $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has more or less willing ten of the twelve spending plans that are barely capable of a majority.
The ghosts differ mainly on it comes to the allocation of resources for insecurity security and security. In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the Wall, one of President Trump's major priorities. The Democrats are bothered by the Wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the construction of the Wall the ghosts part
At present, it is unclear how the parties intend to get closer on this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November. Again, a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the backdrop of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Submission p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the financing of the federal administration would automatically continue at the previous year's level, prevent the travel of parliamentarians and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill allowing all women to benefit from in vitro insemination, which is likely to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The proposal still requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future numerous " children without a father " could grow up. Also, the French Bishops' Conference is against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an " opportunity " for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the costs of artificial insemination for all women are to be borne by the social security.
Fertilization with sperm of dead husband continues to be prohibited
By a narrow majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to their dead husband's sperm for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is permitted " post-mortem. " In Germany, there have been cases in which women sued in vain for the release of the sperm of a deceased. Opponents of the advance in Paris argued that such a conceived child would then bear a " particularly difficult fate. "
Numerous deputies of President Emmanuel Macron's ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic in Motion, LREMacron) and members of the opposition had spoken out in favour of artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be subjected to " double mourning " if the death of her husband left her wish to have children unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow should in future be able to fertilise with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed heterosexual couples who cannot have children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would continue to be banned.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for the climate: Calls for flights for universities become louder
There is a lot of flown at the universities, which is why the country wants to have a climate levy paid there in the future. The rectors say that they have no money for it. But now they are also coming under pressure internally.
Universities should also fly. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion about a climate levy on flights from universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is gaining momentum again. After the State Rectors' Conference had reacted sceptically to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university plead for a compensation of business flights. This one is " urgently needed " as a first step, at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, according to their statement. Meanwhile, the cabinet decision originally planned in July is still on hold, because the CDU has still not approved the submission of the Greens.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the secret service FSB, the detainees fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was an exchange of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. However, this time there were no casualties, it was said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, and North Korean fishermen have been in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard claims to be patrolling to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 cuttlefish seized
During the new checks, 30,000 squid were discovered and confiscated on the boats. Moreover, according to three fishing and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Nakodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily arrested there this year, according to the media.
The head Martynov Russian Fisheries Association in the Far Eastern Primorsky Krai, Georgi Martynov, recently complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These were also used to get small creatures out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where it would take them 200 years to be decomposed.
Only 18,000 in the future: US lowers asylum ceiling
The " most generous nation in history ": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police in the White House.
The richest country in the world is closing itself off from those seeking protection: as the State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be further lowered. In the future, threatened believers and Iraqis in particular will be granted asylum.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the US State Department explained. In the now almost past marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump's administration has drastically reduced the willingness to accept people seeking protection from around the world in recent years, with far higher reception limits under Barack Obama's previous government.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee program in 1980. Nevertheless, the State Department called the US " the most merciful and generous nation in history, " a phrase that is reminiscent of the incumbent US president's parlance.
A " responsible approach " to refugees aims to ensure that the refugees return to their home countries in order to help rebuild, Trump explained. He receives a lot of support from supporters for his hard course in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to close. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had declared the national emergency. Whether there is a time connection between the current measure and the current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selensky affair and a possibly impending impeachment procedure.
According to the State Office, the US government wants to focus on the reception of two refugee groups in the future: people who are being persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as the statement of the State Department shows. However, a maximum of 1,500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to be taken in.
The US wants people from this " northern triangle " of Central America in particular to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has first concluded migration agreements with Guatemala, and now also El Salvador and Honduras, in order to curb immigration on the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from Zoo
At the request of the Argentine judiciary, a female orangutan has been transferred from the former zoo of Buenos Aires to a sanctuary for great apes in the USA. Born in Rostock Rostock zoZoo in 1986, " Sandra " was granted the rights of a " non-human person, " so her release is mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas directly to Dallas on Thursday evening - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human monkey is unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, she is to live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, including " Bubbles, " former pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, " Sandra " has to go through a 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, " Sandra " spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The " Sandras " fundamental rights trial, as initiated by animal rights activists in 2014, has contributed to the transformation of the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and educational institution for the conservation of biodiversity will be established there.
Record for Swiss climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussar ride on the almost 3000-meter-high Großer Pinnacle in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double bottom or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550-metre-high north face of the Great Pinnacle in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute vertigo, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus, he undercut the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in free solo speed on four of the six most important European north faces.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sporting goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profits. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars (just under 1.3 billion euros) in the past quarter, 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy " Nike Direct, " with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
Sales rose to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period to the end of August. Nike sales increased most sharply with an increase of 22 percent in China. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the US state of Oregon thus benefited also in the People's Republic from its approach of addressing consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
CFO Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the " digital transformation " of the sporting goods manufacturer with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors reacted happily to the quarterly figures - the sporting goods manufacturer's shares rose by more than five percent.
Lifelong ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus from AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. Brazilian-born defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and called on his club to take action. " @ officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. # NoToRacism. Proud of be who I am, " wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing for AS Rom since 2016.
The club reacted late Thursday. He reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. Moreover, Roma supporters are never allowed to attend a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist abuse against black players of rival teams. " We cannot have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums, " Fifa President Gianni Infantino said last weekend. The reason for the statement was racist songs at the first division match between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florenz last Sunday.
But there had also been recent discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. Italian authorities have now occupied 38 rioting fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police announced. Accordingly, bans of four to seven years apply to the rest.
The fans are connected with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups in the vicinity of Juventus. The twelve are accused, among other things, of severe extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club started the investigation with an advertisement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders are behind the black trade in tickets. They have " militarily controlled " the ticket trade for the fan curve and are said to have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - entire years are given catchy names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective attitude to life of young people?
" The crabs are coming! " With this call, crab fishing at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun officially un on September 21st, heralding the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international " Slow City " in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international " Slow City " movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of " 30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields. " The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun started breeding crabs back in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that generated high incomes and became an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively sought large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding, as well as technology-based crab breeding, and the city has taken care of promoting greater efficiency in agriculture and farmers' incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform of " distributing power, optimizing administration and government services " and has carefully built the service network for " approvals under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network of services, a platform for lending, " fully optimizing the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local advantages of connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, taking full advantage of the development zone and its position as an international " Slow City " as a flagship tool to locate intelligent high-end production facilities, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors, as well as organic farming companies, which are leaders in the " 3 + 2 " sector. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the establishment of a national tourism zone covering all areas and tourist resorts of national importance. Here, the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape have been integrated, the condition of the buildings for civil services and the public sector has been comprehensively, the areas of tourism tourism tourism tourism tourism tourism and have been vigorously developed and development of cultural tourism has been high quality has been promoted. It is worth looking looking forward to the future of Gaun.
Conflict between Iran and US: Ruhani speaks of ending sanctions - Trump contradicts
After his return from the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions. In exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States had envisaged an end to all sanctions, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump disagreed with his Iranian counterpart via Twitter: " Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on it so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no. "
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting take place. " And America says I am lifting the sanctions, " Ruhani added. The kind of penalties that should be ended has been debated. " And they clearly said we are lifting all sanctions. "
However, this move was not made in an acceptable way, criticized Ruhani. In view of the current punitive measures and " the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure, " no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York, where Europeans hoped to save the nuclear deal with Iran, negotiated with Russia and China, was to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of a catastrophe is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the day before there had been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This increases the concern of a catastrophe.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. On Thursday, the earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 shook the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions. Now, the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential buildings collapse among other things, crusdown by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which were registered as refuges in the center, have long since been built up. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük quake August, the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of Thursday's quake was in the Sea of Marmara in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometres, as reported by the Civil Protection Agency Afad. A few minutes later, a smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that no injuries or damage were been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some students cried, as could be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable-prone. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian earth plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. The earthquake on Thursday hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency schedules, private individuals have so-called go-bags packed with everything they need to stand next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wobbles. When the next big quake will come is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people had been injured and some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques collapsed in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
Many users report panic on social networks. Buildings were wobbling. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than Tuesday's, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned of aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official figures, the time of the quake is given as 13: 59 (local time). According to CNN Turkey, just a few minutes after the first quake, there was an aftershock that with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Just on Tuesday, an earthquake with a magnitude of 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt as far as Istanbul. Its epicenter was also in the Sea of Marmara west of the metropolis of millions, the civil protection authority of Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan, too, was hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. This made it more likely, he told CNN Türk. " These could be the signs of a major earthquake, " Ersoy told the station. " Sooner or later the great quake will come. "
There had already been an incident a few weeks ago - the earthquake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania, there had also been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. The earth had also shaken at Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to possible impeachment proceedings, the US Democrats are encouraged: the complaint about Trump filed by an anonymous whistleblower and his controversial telephone call with the Ukrainian president provide important evidence of investigations against the president. Trump once again sees himself as the victim of a " witch hunt. " Moreover, he doubted the whistleblower's lebbility.
USA: United Airlines passengers locked in toilet - plane diverted
Because a passenger was locked up in the board toilet, a flight was diverted by United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline reported according to US media.
During an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin. She had been locked up in it for about an hour, US US wrote, citing other passengers. For the onward flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change planes.
In a video distributed on the Internet, which according to the US media is supposed to be from flight 1554, can see how several people are trying to free the woman. " We are currently working on opening the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay? " says one man. The airline apologized to all the passengers. First, it was open whether the woman would receive compensation.
The Cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan Writes Brexit Novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story " The Metamorphosis, " British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel " The Cockroach " (original: " The Cockroach ") will be published in German on 27 November Diogenes announced. It is about the transformation of a man named " Jim Sams, " who was ignored or hated in his former life, but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into practice and is wildly determined to let nothing and nobody stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying, " When parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers shamelessly lie like the Soviet leaders once did, when Brexiteers in high positions almost implore the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to this: write. " McEwan's novel " Machines Like Me " about artificial intelligence was only published in the spring.
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself " transformed into a tremendous vermin, " is gradually excluded from family and society and finally perishes. " Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands upside down, " it was said by Diogenes Verlag.

Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31st
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all trips up to and including 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travel could not be " due to insolvency reasons, " the company announced on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or paid in full. The company left open how to travel start from 1 November 2019. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure would be examined, it was said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the wake of the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money to hotels
By contrast, this Friday, however, hotels abroad that currently still host Thomas Cook holidaymakers will receive money from Zurich Insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked to make extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman for the German Press Agency said. " This applies immediately and under the condition that Thomas Cook travellers are not asked or otherwise forced to pay hotel bills individually by these hotels, " spokesman Bernd Engelien continued.
The insurance company reacted to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own statements, had been forced to pay for their own accommodation. Accordingly, some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be agreed with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance spokesman. According to data from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook Thomas holidaymakers were still on the road from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured the holiday and return journey of the Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are currently still on the road. It looks bad for Thomas Cook customers who still want to fly on holiday. Late on Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips up to and including 31 October would be cancelled. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
The company left open how about travel with a start from 1 November 2019. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it was said. In principle, the insurance company Zurich is also responsible for these cases. Sales of new trips are stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys mine in Angola
Prince Harry has been continuing the commitment of Lady Diana for a long time. In Africa, he is now walking directly in the footsteps of his mother.
Dressed in a blue splinter vest, the British Prince Harry has detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Dirico, he created the ignition circuit on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded in the savanna landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same explosive master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to travel the path she took. The pictures on which Princess Diana walked through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She, too, had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Stalling Brexit Negotiations: The Risk of No-Deal Remains Acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made it clear that there is guaranteed not to be a third postponement of the Brexit-negotiations, but what statements are everlasting for the polarizing British British. The's recent Supreme Court ruling hoverhovers like a sword of Damocles over the blond head. His suspension of Parliament in order to be able to stubbornly carry out his Brexit course by the date of withdrawal was annulled earlier this week, and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to effect an extension of bilateral talks by October 31, in the event of failed negotiations with the EU. However, Johnson had categorically repeatedly ruled out this.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal is possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass ore Johnson either. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he hinted that in the event of a disagreement, he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we will abide by the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And preferably with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is gradually running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have around six weeks to prevent the UK from leaving the European Union without an agreement. However, even the recent talks have not achieved a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October seems difficult to imagine at the moment. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further postponement of the withdrawal date will be in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words. It fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US agency: E-cigarette deaths
The number of deaths in connection with the use of e-cigarettes in the USA has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, the US CDC. According to a study in the " New England Journal of Medicine, " there have already been more than 900 affected, about 500 of whom have been confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unclear. No similar increase in lung damage has been reported in Europe. Complaints seem to be limited to users in the USA.
Fear of New Protests in Egypt is Growing
Mohammed Ali's videos have been shared millions of times on online networks, where the contractor and actor, who lives in Spain, calls for a " people's revolution. " Today, Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass rallies with one million participants in central places in the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. An increased police presence was already observed in the center of Cairo. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in recent days, the police had strengthened their road checks and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians partly for news and photos in connection with the protests.
On September 20, demonstrators gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there had been protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted hard. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them were arbitrarily arrested - just because they were " in the wrong place at the wrong time, " HRW said, citing lawyers of those arrested.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing the democratically elected Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially convicted in recent years.
" Ocean Change ": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. Upon his arrival at the Port of Hamburg, he was greeted by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the racing yacht " Malizia. "
In recent months, Fuchs and a team of scientists have investigated and documenting the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship " Dagmar Aaen " on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar explorer. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak. It has been known for decades that the Earth is warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a Planet B.
" What happens at sea often takes place in secret, " said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the litter of the oceans. Among other things, Greenlandic glacier ice had been measured with a drone and fished for microplastics with nets, they said.
For his " fight for sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans, " the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the " Seadevcon Maritime Award " during the Hamburg Climate Week. " For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model, " said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. " He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades. "
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: That seemed too much to two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euros tip included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
" Such cases damage the image of Rome. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud, " demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant came promptly. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to inferred from the bill. Also, a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, said the innkeeper.
A phone call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could indeed be confronted with impeachment after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats now want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - we are talking about weeks until a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The whistleblower's accusation, who ultimately brought the conversation to the public with his complaint out of concern for national security and democracy, is monstrous: the president has abused the power of his office in order to instrumentalize the government of another country for influencing the 2020 election. He has blackmailed Ukraine's dependence in doing process and thus wanted to force it to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be seen in the meanwhile published transcript of the conversation with Zelensky, although it does not reproduce the full wording. However, the telephone call of July 25 is only one episode of a much larger story, in the center of Trump alongside Trump is his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From a public point of view, the story begins in May 2019, when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected President Zelensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are tricky. " We do not interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation of what we have the right to do, " he tells the newspaper. One might think it is inappropriate, but " there is nothing illegal about it. " Giuliani wants investigations to be prosecuted in Ukraine for which there is hardly any basis - " because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could turn out to be helpful to my government. "
The lawyer and former mayor of New York seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, said critics, to construct an occasion for Russia's investigation in the US. However, this accusation could never be taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump Trump will so prominently talk about with Zelensky on the ky in July. Giuliani and the president's version reads: Former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy, Joe Biden, as the Obama administration's Ukraine representative, has pushed for the dismissal of then-Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Schokin, in order to stop his responsible investigation into the gas company on whose board of directors his son Hunter Biden served. Biden senior has financially blackmailed Ukraine to cover up his family's corrupt machinations.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General leave, the investigation against the gas company was already been, and Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Moreover, Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt behavior, the US government was far from the only Western partner who pushed for his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, Germany, Great Britain and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allestörungen.de users report that Facebook has not been loading again and again since about 15.30. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disruption, although not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. often affected by disturbances
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And, as in previous cases, users mainly use Twitter to vent their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in the Antarctic
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the ice of Antarctica by the Chilean Air Force. They were traveling a rubber dinghy and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the misfortune - it took the Chilean rescue helicopter less than an hour to salvage.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean air brigade:
" At 9: 30 a.m. we received the news, shortly before ten o'clock we started, and a good 20 minutes later we were over the rubber dinghy. "
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, and 19 scientists are working there. Frozen researchers have been safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: NEVER charge smartphone wirelessly
Practical
Inductive technology via qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently been launched on the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - above all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Although wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, not necessarily recommendable.
Higher temperature increases
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat generation. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. During wireless charging, however, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees even if the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is a little next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad also increases, which in turn drives the power consumption.
Capacity
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role here. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses its capacity, but also does not last so long overall. Thus, the service life is lower. Therefore, the researchers advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery replacement is always associated with high costs in modern smartphones, this should also be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the cost of battery replacement even again - for all iPhones.

The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging bike - these are now even already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable clutter and tedious plug-pping. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) is a worldwide standard, in which exceptionally even Apple participates, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest traffic jam photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within only six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition operator said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project " Mission Possible. " He has already made international headlines: he took a photo of climbers standing up on Mount Everest that went viral in the spring.
The image of the mass rush triggered a debate about stronger safety measures on the 8,848-meter-high mountain and highest peak on earth. In May, eleven climbers had died during the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason given, among other things, bad weather. At the beginning of the week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China in order to enable it to ascend.
Four Dead Elephants Discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman told Friday. " We suspect the elephants were poisoned. "
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous former rock fortress Sigiriya, visited by many tourists. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously kept themselves. At the same time, about 50 people are killed annually by elephants. This usually happens when the animals migrate through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants still live in Sri Lanka. Theoretically, they are punishable by death.
British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after being was ment by Iran. Bandar Abbas announced this, according to the news agency IRNA. On 19 July 2011, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the British-flag tanker on charges of violating the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
critical management by Thomas Cook
The responsible economic committee of the House of Commons wants to investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook comprehensively. This is about the salary packages of the board as well as the question of why the British government did not contribute financially to the company struggling for survival. " Our interest is in supervision in the company as well as control by external accountants, " said committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. " Apparently we are dealing with a bad example of management greed. "
According to experts, genes are overestimated at colorectal cancer risk
The role of genes in the famili@-@ elevincreased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. This is the conclusion reached by researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits therefore probably weigh more heavily than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colorectal cancer, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
Musk wrote this in an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog " Electrek. " Demand is strong, so that Tesla could place 110,000 orders, Musk's newsletter continued.
The challenge was to bring the cars to the customers quickly. Tesla had to mobilize as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not risen so strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360' 000 to 400' 000 cars. For this, six-digit figures are needed in the current and next quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here, the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were recent losses.
Will British government circumvent Brexit law? Johnson restrained
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping quiet about whether he is looking for ways to circumvent Parliament's recent law against an unregulated Brexit. On a question, he merely told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a " surrender law " that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that postponed the entry into force of the law until after leaving the EU.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is to reach an agreement. "
Iran apparently increases uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased the pressure on the European parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal. " Unfortunately, European states are showing incompetence or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions, " Rouhani said on Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. If they did not stand by their promises, he held out the prospect of " further steps " away from the agreements of the laboriously negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background to this is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained a commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the US unilaterdedly withdrew from the agreement to force Iran to change course with " maximum pressure " in the Middle East policy, which was considered aggressive. President Donald Trump's administration wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now relying on harsh sanctions against Tehran. Iran has recently responded by restarting the uranium enrichment limited by the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now using the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium or at least prepared them for use. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not willing to bear their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rouhani suspected. However, there would still be further talks that would hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the mixed gregation has changed following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had committed responsibility to the attack, but this was seen by the US as a false commitment. " We have nothing to do with it, " Rouhani reiterated his position on Wednesday.
" Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this, " said Rouhani. However, European leaders would not have been able to do that in the talks with him during the UN general debate. Instead Instead, they would only claimed that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration must first be lifted, Rouhani demanded. He called on the government in Washington to switch to a policy of " dialogue and reason. "
Comet crossed by another star
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This has been achieved for the time being. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was christened 2I / Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The well-travelled comet was discovered on 30 August by the amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-made telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter. Follow-up observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not originate from our solar system.
After 1I /' Oumuamua 2017, 2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be sighted during a flight through our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to gain close-up insights into a foreign solar system before it disappears in goodbye. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar bles those of our own system, as reported the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. " The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which at this distance is well above the typical velocities of objects orbiting the Sun, " Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa reported in a statement.
According to the analyses, the comet is on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which initially initially under catalog number C / 2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I / Borisov, the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I /' Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in approach. Thus, the researchers have many months to investigate. " The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020, " explained Farnocchia. " After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020. "
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. Thus, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I /' Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object over 2 to 16 kilometers in a first investigation. Images from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. " The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar, " reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years indicates that these objects could open up a new way to exploring certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent such visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission of the European space agency Esa.
The agency intends to station the three-part " Comet Interceptor " spacecraft in a waiting position at a distance of 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it will either lurk for an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor such as 1I /' Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega Airport Daxing
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People's Republic of China, a first China United Airlines passenger aircraft has landed at the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for the captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are to be handled annually at the new airport, and by 2025 it is expected to reach 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion project. China's most recent prestigious project is also called " starfish " because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new new subway will orts passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
During the construction, the Chinese had already announced several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the - and much smaller - capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, has so far been postponed. On the other hand, a first passenger plane landed in Beijing after only four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly from London to Sydney in 2030 in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - this is what the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams of doing. The US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency, which is a special Synergetic (Air-Breathing Rocket Engine (Sabre) for the 2030s and developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, which is targeted at a supersonic speed for the 2030s. " This is the technology technology could definitely accomplish this, " agency manager Graham Turnock told the station. " We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced. "
In order to drive the project forward, the British Space Agency wants to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to date, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until the closure of its operations in 2003 and took three to three and a half hours. In 2000, there was an accident during the launch of a Concorde at Paris Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, in which all 109 occupants died. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US Space Agency Nasa, the " X-Plane. " Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
" Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport, " writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the " next generation of truly reusable cream devices. "
Uproar in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
" I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information, " Trump told employees of the US embassy to the United Nations in New York on Thursday. The person concerned was almost " a spy " and they had been dealt with " a little differently " than they are today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate the tippers. Actually, the event was not public. However, several US media disseminated audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced preparations for impeachment proceedings against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who is making serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. Due to great public pressure, the whistleblower's accounts were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received information from several government officials that the US president " uses the power of his office " to ensure that another country interfere in the 2020 US election in his favor.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate what could harm his political rival Joe Biden, previous business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is ahead in the democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukraine telephone call: Leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the blanket. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been drawn up. However, this had been removed from a commonly provided database after the conversation on the instructions of White House lawyers and instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known, and the New York Times reported that he was an employee of the CIA.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the " so-called whistleblower " had spread information from second-hand that turned out to be incorrect, so there might be no tippers or spies at all.
However, how Trump spoke in New York about those who allegedly leaked information to the whistleblower caused outrage. US House chairman Nancy Pelosi reacted with concern, complaining that Trump's statement once again undermined the administration's integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations have been going on in various committees against Trump and his surroundings for months. In view of Ukraine's allegations, the Democrats are now pushing forward investigations with renewed force in order to initiate a possible impeachment procedure against Trump.
" The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation, " said the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff sharTrump,, attacked Schiff, accused him of a misrepresentation of things and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insults Schiff and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
In a statement published on Friday, more than 300 former security and foreign-policy officials, most of whom worked under Democratic and Republican presidents, backed the Democrats " investigation into a possible impeachment process. If the allegations came true, it would be " an unscrupulous abuse of power " by Trump, it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could initiate a so-called impeachment procedure, but the decision on actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have a majority. Thus, the chances of success of such a process are slim. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
VW Works Council: Jobs are being cut " creeping "
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023, of which 500 million euros are to be saved as early this year.
One key to this is personnel costs. The " Future Pact " negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be cut at the carmaker if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security applies until 2029.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from works council circles, jobs in production, which are actually not at disposal, are " stealthily " in a different way - that is, past the official course. Thus, vacant regular positions would often not be filled again.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility of forcing the reinoccupation. Meanwhile, there is a lack of personnel in many places, the densification of work is increasing, the concerns about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would increase. Thus, the fear that the vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is favorable in other parts of the world. From VW it was only said: " As agreed, an adjustment of the employment volume is socially compatible along the demographic curve. "
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more worldwide and centrally manage new projects. This, too, is intended to reduce costs and also accelerate decisions - behind this is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitivity.Chief Production Officer Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: " Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof. "
In this way, there are already successes: this year, for example, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. VW does not give exact figures on the production time, according to information from our newspaper, it amounts to the Golf 7 around
.
In our region, the main plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb applies within VW applies that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year for the plant to be satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, capacity utilization in Wolfsburg plant was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to declining diesel demand and the problems of switching to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust test method.
However, as Chief Production Officer Tostmann announced last year, one million cars are to roll off the production line in Wolfsburg " in perspective. " This should make it possible to bundle golf production at the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is handing ish golf production by converting it into a site for e-car production.
In addition, the Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) SUVs are produced in Wolfsburg. However, sales of the Gulf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations now rest on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build e-mobility, it is to remain the bread-and-butter car of the Wolfsburgers for the time being.
Forced into prostitution with voodoo: traffickers sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected traffickers have been imprisoned for this.
Six suspected traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and prison terms of up to eight years and three months on Friday in Bochum. The accused had smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian women willing to leave the country had to take a ritual oath in their homeland in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean in inflatable boats with the help of Libyan smugglers. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. Once in Germany, they were distributed to different brothels in order to process the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25 000 euros. Therefore, the wages were completely taken away from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the infiltration and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothels at the trial. " The work made it physically and mentally difficult for women, " said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. " Some were really disgusted. "
The judgments are on commercial and band smuggling of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and serious forced prostitution.
Ufo negotiations with Lufthansa
QIn the long-term dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendant union Ufo has again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will " inform about the industrial action in the LH Group on 14 October, " said UFO collective bargaining director Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with the UFO for months, This well as whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
Following a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court, UFO is now strengthened on this point. Lufthansa wanted to be determined that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company upheld the decision and will appeal against it. " I think it is unlikely that a second court will see the matter completely differently, " said UFO board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Frankfurt Regional Labour Court to have the status of the UFO as a trade union reviewed in court. The company argues that the union has not set up a representative board for months and is therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the trade union, during which numerous members of the board as well as the advisory board resigned, including the long-time trade union leader Nicoley Baublies. Due to doubts about its leadership, the UFO had suspended an already begun mood about strikes by the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July.
Easy entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but that is about to change now. The Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, it wants to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the tourism commission announced.
" The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country, " said Ahmad Al-Khatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult for tourists to access. Visas are usually only awarded for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with members in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes for more income from the tourism business. According to Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones had hit two of the most important oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churai oil field. As a result, national oil production collapsed dramatically, oil price bullets soaring. It is likely to take several weeks for the Kingdom's oil production to return to its old levels.

Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic. On Friday, the wreck was discovered in a forest area near the town of Mecin (Metschin), the police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening, after the crew had given an emergency signal via GPS. During the search, a military helicopter was also in use. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also the causes of the threat, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on Friday in Brussels. It examined the populations of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of endangerment and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from " potentially endangered " to " endangered, " " endangered, " " endangered " and " extinct in nature " to " extinct. " In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
rowan and wild chestnut threatened
In Germany, rowans (Sorbus) are particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. " Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats. "
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered " endangered " since 2017, level two on the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan miner moth, alongside a mushroom. It has been spreading from southeastern over the the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 specimens. This does not include the trees in cities, parks and avenues in this assessment.
shrubs and mosses also in danger
The IUCN scientists simultaneously compilup new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of the molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
" This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet, " said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europa Office. " We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority. "
Earthquake off Istanbul: 34 casualties reported
34 people were injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey. According to the, there were no deaths. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, and 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. Since the earthquake the day before, there had been almost 200 aftershocks. On Thursday, the magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years Turkey was not sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian earth plates.
One of the heaviest quakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time the epicenter was located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday, a quake of magnitude 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the half-time show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl, as the singers announced on Twitter. " It won't get bigger, " Shakira wrote about a photo of herself and Lopez. She is incredibly excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. The time will come in Miami on February 2, 2020.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - when she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the half-time show. " Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years and I'll perform with another Latin. " She can't wait " to show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world. "
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to stand alongside another artist on one of the largest stages in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. " And then on my birthday! " The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two " queens " are on stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining spectator numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you have recently dropped the number of viewers: this February, the spectacle in the USA attracted very few viewers in more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
There had been a moil over the half-time show of the last Super Bowl: According to media reports, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear in the dispute over dealing with quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had fallen to his knees at the national anthem in the 2016 / 17 season before NFL games in protest against police violence and racism. Kaepernick had triggered a movement with his protest, numerous players over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump sharply attacked the mostly African-American football stars. Kaepernick himself has been unaffiliated since March 2017 and has no longer played an NFL game. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook bankruptcy: Hotels get money from the insurance
According to a press report, the bankruptcy of travel provider Thomas Cook is likely to cost some banks dearly. There is a risk of high depreciation of outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected, writes the Financial Times in its Friday issue.
According to the report, banks like Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Credit Credit, and Credit Suisse would probably have to total depreciation of up to £1.8 billion (around EUR 2 billion) on their books, as estimates by the consulting firm AlixPartners have shown.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept depreciation of £900 million to £1 billion and the lenders between £550 and £825 million. The amounts actually depreciated are more likely to be at the upper end of the bandwidths, an expert told the paper.
How great the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end will become apparent after the end of the insolvency proceedings. A person close to this procedure did not spread much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in Great Britain are " old " and many of the properties are in bad locations. The most money can probably be obtained with the sale of the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand, it was said.
Rackete allegedly brought alleged murderers to Italy
Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. " We cannot rule this out, but we do not have reliable information ourselves, " Ruben Neugebauer, spokesman for the Sea-Watch, told the news agency dpa.
Other migrants have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. " They come without passports. "
On 29 June, Carola Rackete illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa and rammed a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects are said to have arrived there. Investigations are underway against the captain for aid iding illegal immigration.
US warns against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the German government against trusting the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great, " Pai told Handelsblatt with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a " national security law " that obliges every company " under Chinese jurisdiction " to follow the instructions of the security organs.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such inquiries, " continued the head of the FCC. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to demand a " declaration of trustworthiness " from suppliers.
Initially, Berlin wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the " Handelsblatt, " citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
The software in particular is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, " said Pai.
It is " very hard to imagine " that a government agency, " no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to track down security risks, " the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of being in close contact with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership structure is opaque, and the employee company that allegedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government, " Pai told Handelsblatt.
The US has insights that government employees are placed within the company. Pai recently visited Berlin for talks to promote the position of the US.
Chemical Factory in Northern France Burns: Schools Closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic wall of fire illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleanup could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
As a precaution, the facilities would not open in twelve municipalities on Friday, the responsible prefecture announced. The Ministry of the Interior had called on the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to expose themselves to the smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals indoors, protect their food and stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still the risk that smell will spread after the extinction, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police and gendarmes were deployed at the fire.
A gigantic black column of smoke had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizl, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations, which are particularly monitored. A devastating chemical accident occurred in Seveso near Milan, Italy, in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that at first no " high toxicity " had been detected in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. Dams against the pollution had been built in the river, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at around 2: 40 a.m., the authorities reported. Initially, the cause remained unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister said: " Germany must invest now "
French Minister of Economy and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better, " said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for next year.
The eurozone economy is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens in order to make the necessary decisions. "
Those states that have room for manoeuvre for more investment must act, said Le Maire, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France does not have this room for manoeuvre, the minister added, pointing to his country's high level of public debt, which is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. French public debt must be " stabilised " and " reduced, " Le MaMasaid.
In recent years, France has repeatedly made appeals to Germany to make more public investments in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday envisages tax breaks of more than nine billion euros for households.
Among other things, the French government is reacting to the protests of the Yellow Vest movement. New debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to the expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson avoids Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the " surrender law " passed by Parliament.
The parliament is back, a law requires the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Asked about this possibility, however, the Tory politician evades.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covering about whether he wants to impose an unregulated Brexit - despite the law recently passed by Parliament, which exactly is supposed to prevent this. Johnson merely told journalists that his administration would abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a " surrender law " that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until after he left the EU. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is with an agreement. "
Meanwhile, Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings meanwhile explained that he saw the political disputes over Brexit as a " walk in the park " and was confident that the planned exit from the EU would still come place: " We enjoy this, we will win, we will leave the EU (editor's note), don't worry, " Cummings told the British newspaper " Telegraph " Telegraph. "
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign " Vote Leave " during the election campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as chief strategist in the British government of Downing Street. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policies that have led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book " The Polaroid Diaries " delves deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the illustrated book " The Polaroid Diaries " at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. illustrious guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders front woman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: " # ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse of the life of an extraordinary pre-Instagram family, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film. "
The camera was always there of Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography. She made thousands of Polaroids, a few hundred of which are now being published for the first time in " The Polaroid Diaries. "
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. " She wanted real moments, " the art critic Ekow shun writes in his preface. And of course, focus is always on focus: her husband Paul - as you might never have seen before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephones in a bathrobe with a bag his head or wears bulky moon boots. Sure course, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also led a completely normal life on their farm in southern England or in Scotland beyond the spotlight light. According to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And it has not always been tidy with the McCartneys.
Like no other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's shots are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to take it at exactly the right moment, " said Paul McCartney. " If you snap it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo. " And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing exactly the right moment. " She just knew she had, " Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the frame and the colors are right, which makes " The Polaroid Diaries " not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but is besides everything anecdotal also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes sometimes look like abstract paintings. The perfect complement to the newly released Beatles album " Abbey Road, " which was released exactly 50 years ago.
" We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran "
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our gas from there, " Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems with the import of Iranian oil, as some companies had " withdrawn because of the US threats. "
Nonetheless, Turkey will " continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues, " said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of " maximum pressure " on the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not abiding by the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. Tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably in recent months.
US government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the US State Department declared that the annual upper limit of a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which corresponds to an cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said that while the US remains committed to supporting refugees, the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overburdened.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on taking in two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as the State Department's statement shows. However, a maximum of 1,500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to be taken in.
Launched in 1980, the program selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the U.S. The cap of 18,000 refugees for 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. Even the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When US President Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was nearly 85,000.
Aid organizations were horrified to the announced lowering of the ceiling. " This is a very sad day for America, " said David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, and the US would further damage its leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US, both legally and illegally. According to the US government, he expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - " Join a spy "
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage in the whistleblower affair. Whoever has given information to the informant who accuses him of abuse of power " comes close to a spy, " Trump said according to a recording at a private event in New York on Thursday, as several US media agree.
When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, " That comes close to a spy. " Then Trump added, " Do you know what we did in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a bit differently than we do now. "
Observers considered the latter remark to be a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats strongly criticised Trump's statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a Congressional investigation into a possible impement ment case against him, the leaders of the House House Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight Committees.
In a recently published complaint, the whistleblower accuses the president of having abused his office to request another country to interference in the 2020 US election. Specifically, it concerns, among other things, his controversial telephone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selensky in the summer: In the conversation, Trump advised him to launch an investigation against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower himself and his informants are, but as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be a CIA analyst.
Refugee boat capsized: Baby and toddlers drown in the Aegean Sea
Again and again people try to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea. The often too small boats regularly capsize. Seven migrants - including five children - have now been killed when a rubber dinghy sank.
Seven migrants were killed off the Greek island of Chios in the sinking of a rubber dinghy, including a baby and four other children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men, were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is said to be a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small archipelago of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not yet known which countries the migrants come from. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey transfer to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in far too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who cancel concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end due to a disment by lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to perform. At the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: " I think I should leave it as long as it was still running. "
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey " really could not speak now. " Townsend promised the audience to get his money's worth at a reparation concert. However, a date is not yet fixed.
Performances planned for Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver cancelled The Who. They are to be made up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
WeWork has become the largest office tenant in New York.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from a small startup to a driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to disturrupt the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. A few days ago, the company had disposed founder Adam Neumann as CEO, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for the executives in order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British " Financial Times, " among others reports that WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect. Thus, the largest tenant of office space in New York and London, among others, is suddenly off the market.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and rents it out to members at short notice in partly small units. These can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork burns money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company recorded a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs are said to have risen to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars by renting ever new large space. In order to limit the loss, the new management is now said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped the lease of new space with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into leases with maturities of up to 15 years, resulting in liabilities of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork has rented ased almost 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, over the past 24 months. WeWorks new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the space that newly came onto the market at the time. Without WeWorks expansion, the office vacancy in the US metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in the " Business Insider. " The situation is similar in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in a prime location.
In the British capital, too, the balance in the real estate market could be noticeably pushed without a further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis bought last year by the Sparkassen fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the hoped-for billions in revenues. They do not have access to the - scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term lease contracts. The rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by specially founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within tight limits.
Russia once again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of another 262 poachers have been arrested who have fished illegally in the waters, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB informed, according to the Interfax agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot at and three of them injured. This time, there had been no casualties, it was said. Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian territorial waters. There, according to its own information, the Russian Coast Guard drives patrols to protect their marine biological resources. 30,000 squid were discovered during the new inspections. According to the data, three fishing and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Nakodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the Ria Novostostagency, the Coast Guard found a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
Even after complaints by local entrepreneurs, the Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea were already temporarily arrested there in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern Region of Primorsky Krai, Georgi Martynov, recently complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures from the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed. Also, the ships themselves would not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the arrests last week. According to the FSB, a wounded North Korean man also died later of his injuries. On September 17, Russian border guards first detained a North Korean boat and then a second after it had opened fire.
US imposes entry ban on former President Castro
The US has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, as the US State Department justified in a statement on Thursday with Castro's involvement in " gross human rights violations. " As head of the Caribbean Communist Party, he presides over a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. " The disregard for human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela, " American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted.
President Donald Trump issued entry bans on members of the Venezuelan government and military, among others, on Wednesday. A fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging in Venezuela for months. The US has imposed a series of sanctions on Maduro's government in order to bring him to his knees and help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of posted doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents of the government.
New Fridays for Future protests
One week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. Because of the time difference New Zealand and Australia Australia are likely to start before the protests spread across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How great the worldwide popularity will be this Friday after the record participation of last week is relatively unclear. Thunberg herself was in good spirits. " Last Friday, more than four million people went on strike for the climate. We'll do it again this Friday! " she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6,383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
The influx of last Friday was particularly high in Germany. According to estimates by Fridays for Future, a good third of all demonstrators worldwide - around 1.4 million - took part in the protests in 575 German cities. This time, according to the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg sat down in front of the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call on their country's politicians to step up their commitment to climate protection, which led to the emerging Fridays for Future movement within a short time. Pupils and students are taking part in the climate protests, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politicians in the fight against earth heating and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be reduced to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Almost a month ago, after a two-week transatlantic cruise, Thunberg arrived in New York on a deep-sea racing yacht, where she recently participated in United Nations climate protests and summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional spespeech at the UN in which she spoke to the conscience of the world's heads of state and government. In her home country of Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony, which provides for a change in fire protection. " This also applies to smoking, " said a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency, according to the Tass agency in Moscow on Thursday. The ban is due to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes nevertheless must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should light a fire, then the penalty will be higher. According to the ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Also grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Strike cybercriminals - investigators dig servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time dug out a large server provider for illegal business on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as the operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, through which internationally active criminals carried out their machinations.
This was announced by the Prosecutor General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a large-scale action. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world's second largest darknet marketplace for drugs, " Wall Street Market, " which was smashed by investigators in the spring. According to the Attorney General's Office, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyberbunker.
Such a hoster was excavated for the first time in Germany, it was said. A web host provides the infrastructure for a website.
During the access campaign with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigation. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New Fridays for Future climate protests
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests ǀ Who are Thunberg's backers?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm up the climate. All the more astonishing that a 16-year-old girl of all people holds the mirror in front of the nose of the power people of that time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and causes young people to stand up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person has managed to win over a collection of children and young people. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a fairjust world. At that time, he was able to win over a crowd of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea to get into the promised land, just like Greta Thunberg recently went on her trip to America with a sailboat.
But is there a dark side in this regard? Why is it a share called " We don't have time " to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. Quite incidentally, mother mother has published a book that has sold far extensively, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Well-tried followers of Greta Thunberg were also a little indignant about the PR PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably also too thick for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into its own in the media worldwide and there is a lot of money thanks to the impressive action.
Here the spirits now differ: Is it morally right to enrich oneself financially in saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together with stock market brokers during the world rescue action? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy thrives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question even seemingly pious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is crossing our solar system.
Astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed that a foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time, the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty that a comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. It was christened 2I / Borisov after its discoverer and is currently employying astronomers worldwide.
Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The aforementioned body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov in Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-made telescope and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to be sighted during transit.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain close insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, Comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before the time comes, astronomers can observe it in detail, because in contrast to its predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in its approach, which means that it can be examined from Earth for many months. " The object will reach its greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible with medium-sized telescopes by April 2020, " explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa. " After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020. "
New visitor's predecessor: 1I / 2017 U1 " Oumuamua. "
First comet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body appears to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual findings. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years may allow a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again asteroids keep the researchers busy. Only recently, a giant asteroid raced past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
" Absolutely reprehensible ": Rachel Johnson horrified by brother
Around Boris Johnson it becomes lonelier. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister castigates with clear words the warlike language of the prime minister as " tasteless. " It is not the brother she knows.
" Surrender, " " fraud, " treaty ": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to arm himself - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this met with massive outrage from the opposition, and now other critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation, as if opponents of leaving the EU should be " hanged, elongated, quartered, tarred and feathered. " She considered this to be extremely reprehensible. She does not recognize her brother's version, said Rachel Johnsons, who ran for the anti-Brexit party " Change UK " in the EU Parliament elections.
She particularly blashed with the fact that her brother mentioned Jo Cox, a pro-EU Member of Parliament, who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 exit referendum. Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons that they best be honoured by passing Brexit. " It is very tasteless to refer to a MP who was murdered by someone who shouted' Britain first', " criticized Johnson's sister. The perpetrator had obviously come from the far-right camp, which felt strengthened " by this kind of language. " For all who mourned her, it was very tasteless.
Cox's widower also sharply criticized the prime minister. " It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like that, " he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to stand passionately and resolutely for what you believe in - no matter what view you were. But you should never " demonize the other side. " He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory MP. " I've been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it's an indissoluble tension, " said Jo Johnson.
Johnson's language also met with harsh criticism in the Church. As reported by the Times, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is " not worthy of this country. " In a joint statement, they declared: " In recent days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside parliament. We should talk to each other with respect. "
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez Super Bowl
The NFL is sending a strong signal in the year of its 100th anniversary: the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl features two women with Latino roots, who promise " an explosion of fun and energy. "
Latina power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming final of the US Football League NFL, as the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
" I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, who has incredible strength in the US, " Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. Many people with Latin American roots live in the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida. Shakira (" Waka Waka ") comes from Colombia, Lopez (" On the Floor ") is of Puerto Rican origin.
" I love the fact that the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time - and two Latinas, " Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises " an explosion of fun and energy " for the show.
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed big hits with songs like " Waiting For Tonight " or " Let's Get Loud " and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in German cinemas in the drama " Hustlers " from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. Her worldwide breakthrough came in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single " Whenever, Whereever. "
The announcement of the mid-term guests in the US eagerly awaited every time. This year, many also see the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, well over 100 million television viewers watch the NFL final, it is now extremely popular in Germany.
Last year there was political controversy in advance. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise while playing the national anthem in protest against police violence against blacks and had been harshed ed by US President Donald Trump, among others. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a Super Bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that rock group Maroon 5 appeared was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber adds Egypt's ruler: For the time being, however, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have an influence on whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt both spent last week abroad. One of them was returned to Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general who deposed the Muslim Brotherhood Mohamed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's actions against political Islam and had lost no syllable about the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president. He had " no reason to worry, " Sisi said at the airport in the microphones of the state television. " The Egyptians will not be misled. "
According to the president, the other man who is currently determining events on the streets is trying to mislead this. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he escapes the grip of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to set foot on Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor to only a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafés, living rooms and tea rooms: with his YouTube channel, " Mohammed's Secrets, " Ali calls on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He approaches the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president is indulging in luxury and has magnificent new palaces built for him, it is said. Ali reaccuses the army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with these very gentlemen for 15 years in his second job as a building contractor, he seems to know pretty well what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding click numbers show.
After thousands of people had demonstrated against his rule for the first time since Sisi's grip on power and almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a " march of millions " for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would really venture into the streets. However, there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giza near Cairo and in the village of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests, whose participants accused Al-Sisi of causing corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos could not be verified at first. It was said from security circles that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile delta, where demonstrators tore banners with the portrait of the president to pieces last week, massive police was reported on Friday. Security forces established checkpoints in the city and on the arterial roads. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed for " maintenance work, " most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And in Rabaa Square, where supporters of the overthrew Muslim Brotherhood Morsi entrenched in 2013 until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was intended to prevent dissatisfied people from gathering: Sisi's Future Party wanted to hold a large rally for the president here.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: " Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square, " Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. " Let us not collide with police officers. " However, this is not to be understood as a retreat: " All of Egypt is Tahrir Square. "
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various verification options.
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not need to blindly trust the speeds of the providers. Customers can check themselves how much of it is actually achieved in case of abnormalities.
After all, the pre-promised transfer rates are a contractual component and should therefore also be achieved, explains the consumer association Bavaria.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options. For example, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
" However, the tests of the providers are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively, " the consumer association Bavaria points out on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised service. Those affected do this best in writing by insertion letter.
If this does not cause anything even after repeated requests, customers can terminate and under certain circumstances also claim damages. However, in the absence of success, only the course of action would help.
First Senior Republican for Investigation
As the first senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont has spoken out in favor of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are established, " Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken - an impeachment process can lead to the dismissal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly issued a phone call asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the interventions of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden " for years. "
Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump for the whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort about it. Scott's remarks are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already opposed Trump Trump's policies several times, such as relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: Another Marvel movie planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel would go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the " Avengers " universe. It was completely unclear how the films about Tom Holland would continue.
Now the surprise: After " Spider-Man: Homecoming " and " Spider-Man: Far From Home, " Spider-Man will receive another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), which is reported by several US media outlets. Accordingly, the theatrical release will already be announced: the film is scheduled to start in the USA on July 16, 2021.
In the magazine " Screenrant " Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: " I am pleased that Spidey's path will continue in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring. "
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel allegedly has made an offer. According to industry magazines, Disney, which also includes Marvel, would contribute 30 percent of the revenue from upcoming Spider-Man films. However, the news is not confirmed.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the " Suits " finale
After nine seasons, the series " Suits " has now reached the grand finale in the USA. In the last episode there were many happy ends and just as many cameo appearances. And the royal couple Prinz Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, were paid tribute in a charming way. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
First of all: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale for a last farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some reviews showed once again the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. Such as the moments of the failed and successful marriage with Mike or how she welcomes him after his prison sentence.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned casually in the " Suits " finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) just straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit. Whether he has actually thrown over a frock overcoat, the bewildered Harvey wants to know from the bridegroom then, only to snippingly note: " Louis, you are not the Prince of England. "
Aegean Sea: Baby and four other children drown in case of boat accident
One baby and four other children drowned while capsizing in the Aegean Sea. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently moving to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean Sea. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 174 people died on this route last year. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced his intention to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wanted to " find out what the refugee situation is like in Turkey, " said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards, he wanted to learn more about the " administrative problems of the Greeks " in Athens in order to be able to help cope with them.
A spokesperson for the EU Commission confirmed Seehofer's planned trip on Friday with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
Unusually large numbers of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive in Greece. On Tuesday alone, 654 people moved to the Greek islands, said the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increase in have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come to the Greek islands illegally via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take in a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
However, due to a shortage of personnel, the processing of asylum applications is difficult on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, almost 29,400 people are waiting for Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The situation on Lesbos is the worst: 5,200 migrants are currently housed in a camp with capacities for 650 people.
Never before since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 have there been so many, reported the state broadcaster.

Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo breakdown
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the mug manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green leader holds a reusable cup in her hand in a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa / Canada - It has gone unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held the reusable coffee cup with metal straw in her hand. On the party's website, she was seen on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and the cup was still a disdainful (cardboard) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Head of the Green Party must answer for photo breakdown
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and producing fake news to appear more credible credible on the subject of " environmental protection, " in the middle of a campaign for the House of Commons, in which Trudeau is increasingly struggling with a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked the discussion about fake news. A user shares a juxtaposition of the photos and writes: " The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their disposable cup. "
May was shocked and asserted on her blog that she had not known about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: She, in conversation with citizens, put a cup in her hand. However, however, she corrected correctly, was made of bamboo. She always had it with her. A spokeswoman for the party said that it was only about placing the party logo in the picture and not about covering something up. Only an excerpt of the photo can be seen on the website.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did that. " I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide, " she told the Guardian and at the same time asked for something from her over-committed team: " If they feel like working on a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face so that I look younger? "
The German Greens also got into Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not gefotoshoppt. So the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de * reported.
Influencer wants free upgrade: Cathay lifelong flight ban
Jaqueline Ng was allegedly promised an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific. However, when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Getting a Business Class upgrade spontaneously - many passengers dream of that. Sometimes they are lucky, and the check-in staff offer a change from Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: a self-proclaimed influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users on Instagram. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the outward flight, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, even though she had presented an e-mail in which Cathay Pacific allegedly promised her an upgrade. The influencer claims to have received the letter from a marketing employee of the airline. The airline, however, accuses Jaqueline of forging the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were sceptical: They checked the headquarters. And, indeed, the employee from whom the mail allegedly originated is said to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline staff at the airport cancelled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. She had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan for 1,400 US dollars (around 1,280 euros).
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests. Cathay had reimbursed her for the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: the influencer has committed fraud for Cathay, she remains closed for future flights. Furthermore, the airline's terms and conditions state that she does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now hires a lawyer.
Oil prices fall after ceasefire report in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar within a very short time on Friday afternoon. Most recently, a barrel (159 liters) of Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The slide was triggered by a Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of global oil production to a standstill in mid-September. Houthi rebels in the civil war country of Yemen, allied with Iran, had claimed the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices thus continue its downward movement of the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent almost $65.
Most recently, Bloomberg, citing insiders, reported that repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia is progressing faster than expected after the mid-September attack. Accordingly, production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back towards the original volume.
Most recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders who report on rapid progress made by the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some détente in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " is on its way to leave the port more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently granted release. Now, the crew is preparing for departure while the ship is still at anchor, shipping company boss Erik Hånell told the Swedish radio in a text message on Friday morning.
However, the US announced that it would transfer defensive missiles and soldiers to the Iranian arch-enemy in Saudi Arabia. Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and the UK had temporarily driven up oil prices in recent weeks.
Charges against Trump intensify
In the affair of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, cover-up allegations against the White House have been voiced. Several government officials have worked hard to prevent access to the wording of the conversation following a contentious phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in late July, as an anonymous whistleblower said. House Speaker Democrat Nancy Pelosi explicitly accused the White House of " cover-up. " Trump spoke of a " witch-hunt. "
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that the nuclear dispute will soon see a third summit of rulers Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The meaning and prospects of success of such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The US has so far done nothing to implement the summit's decisions last year, said the adviser to the North Korean State Department. He also criticized US sanctions and the joint military manoeuvres of the US and South Korea. However, he hoped that Trump would make " wise " and " courageous " decision to return to rapprochement.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he agrees to do so. Negotiations on disarm the North Korea's nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the talks, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers help clear mines

Pounds under pressure - Interest rate cut expected
British under pressure
With an early cut in interest rates, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculation about an early rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) is causing the pound sterling. The British currency fell by up to 0.4 percent on Friday to 1.2269 dollars.
Sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders, who brought an interest rate cut into discussion, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, as Saunders is considered an advocate of restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista from the brokerage house ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the Brexit hickhack burden on the economy without directly signalling an interest rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU on 31 October without a divorce agreement if necessary.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk. However, it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations have been proven
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Vada) and current head of integrity of the World Athletics Federation.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details on the doping scandal in Russia are coming to light - and they are destroying the little credibility that Russian sport had recovered at the beginning of the year and even to some extent. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were falsified.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports was unveiled. Thereupon, Wada banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banished from the world stage. After individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes from the country compete under a neutral flag, at the Winter Games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were also allowed to participate in the World Cups in the various sports, in the summer even the World Cup took place in Russia with the host as a participant.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban again, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information about the extent of the cover-up of doping cases during state doping. They should help to punish athletes retrospectively. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory has been manipulated. " Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the right data, " said David Howman in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. " We found numerous discrepancies between the data that the ada ada from a whistleblower and those that it received from the Russians in January. " Many positive findings mentioned in the McLaren report were missing.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Federation is the only organization that to the spell of Russia. At the World Championships in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put forward manipulations and called on Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening to ban the Rusada again and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
