Oil tanker " Stena Impero " left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas this Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker moved and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it remained in Iranian waters at first. The shipping company was said that they wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
The " Stena Impero " had been set on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Straroad of Hormuz on charges of having violated safety regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran reacted to the controversial, temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the Gibraltar belonging to Great Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil export is shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran.

Puzzles solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress had also been made on the question of why children defend themselves so strongly against tickling, only to demand more.
After all, it was became shown why the approach of a tickling hand alone triggers laughter even the touch, due to a deep-lying layer in the cerebrum, which caused laughter even at the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with " laughter " in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans. This " laughter " is medied by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-contact
So far, it has been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-contact and touch by others - that is, people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out in the experiments on the rats that laughter as well as the activity of the respective area of of cerebebral corare suppressed ressed during self-contact. This is also the case if living beings clean themselves. However, during the the foreign contact and tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh had been fied.
But if the self-contact and touch by others happens at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed This This indicates the brain of the the cannot distinguish between self-contact and touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves, because self-contact activates a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Thus, they sometimes broke off this initiation in the experiment prematurely, showed escape behavior or stighterror. This ambivalence is emto the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioural reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Catastrophe averted: major fire extinguished in French chemical plant

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister

The prime minister threatens to lead the country from the EU without an agreement on 31 31 if Brussels does not accept his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, how he intends to achieve this is unclear.
About Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the prime minister said: " The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and to reunthat country would be be to leave the EU. " Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum election campaign.
Memorial to Oslo and Utöya attacks unveiled

Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. British oil tanker " Stena Impero, " detained in Iran was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero, " which was been in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The " Stena Impero " had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, explained shipping manager Erik Hånell. Around noon, the ship had left the Iranian waters. " It's great that it's over, " he told the Swedish TV station SVT.
The State Department in London described the fixing of the ship as illegal. " This is part of a pattern of attempts to compromise maritime freedom. We are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law, " said a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on 19 July on charges of having violated regulations on the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well according to the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in view of the difficult and grueling situation over the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to reunthem with their families as quickly as possible.
The British government suspected behind the fixing of the " Stena Impero " a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar: At the beginning of July, a super tanker with oil from Iran, which is said to have been ined for Syria, was put on the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against the warring country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of " piracy " and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the " Adrian Darya-1 " was finally released. London vehemently rejected any icitions that it was a bardeal in order to free the " Stena Impero. "
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The US left from the international nuclear agreement in 2018, which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been putting the leadership in Tehrhrunder with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a stricter and extended to other areas. Iran has so far resisted pressure.
Because of the dispute over the " Stena Impero " and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz to the UN General Assembly in New York. With the " Coalition of Hope " initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the the of of shipping in the Persian, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protpowers.
India is forting a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined as a " war profiteer. " Given the punitive tariffs that America's President Donald Trump imposes on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to replan. Financial leaders of Asian firms who are relocmoving their production from China to another country, India cites as one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey, But this has not only have do with the uncertainties of of the Sino-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems incised to play a more significant role in the globally extensive production chain.
But now India itself has fallen into Trump's focus. Devjoratively the " Kingdom of tariffs " by the warHouse in the White House, America prived the emerging market of the trade benefits for 2000 products in early June. The US prohibitively accuses bibihigh tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, however, the friction with India is merely a sideshow. Moreover, America also views the world's largest democracy through security policy-glasses. Delhi and Washington share share concern about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a volvo of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just assumed a second five-year term, is therefore likely to lull into security.
The problem, however, lies in a different place: the empirically confirmed thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult time in the socialist Republic of India. Even under Modi. His zeal for reform mainly mainly at the bureaucratic madness that has stiocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies are now receiving building permits for buildings more quickly. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more tanchy insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for liquidating apparently dead companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic perspective, much has changed for the better in India in the first five of years. However, this does not apply to trade policy. Inspired ated to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign providers, the national conservative government even built new barriers.
In the West, Modi depends on the nimbus of the energetic reformer who radically renews his country economically, owing not least least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At its core, the " India First " lawyer never moved away from protectionist economic policies, preventing Indian Indian firms from being forced to get rid of anronronistic processes and thus fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the isolation of their industries are among the regular voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and auament this short-sighted policy.

Finving line: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The world top had long been at the finish, when heart-warming scenes took place in the coolcooldown Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to fluctuate dangerously. He could hardly hold on his legs a good 300 meters before the finish, ran in an unhealthy posture, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly hookhim him and dragged him the last half of the stadium to the finish. However, the forces of both were still enough to stop the running wristwatch after the finish run. As if the scene had not been curious enough.
" I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same, " said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpecexpectedly attracted the attention of the gathered journalists. Shyly he evdged first, did not want to talk about his exploit at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help one fellow suffererer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he should not even have started. " That's why I'm proud to run here for my country, " he said.
He did that emphatically that evening - and much more intensively than he would have thought. Because this heroic deed will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even let his competitor Busby even take lead at the finish and voluntarily took over the last place - by the way a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. It was nothing no use in the end, because the Busby, who only only the finish with a lot of help, was disqualified by the World Light tics tics Association ation at the end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had competed to set a personal best at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18: 10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: " I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. I've already been under 18 minutes. " However, only in training, best times do not count.
Millions mash: Egyptians prepare up for wild day of protest
In Egypt, the security measures have been intensified in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. An increased police presence was observed in the center of Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, the police had stepped up their road controls and partially searched pedestrians' mobile phones for news and photos in connection with the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Al-Sisi's Sopponents
Last weekend there were protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria Alexandria SuSuand and Mansura. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, accaccused critics of corruption and mismanagement. There had not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. Egyptian contraccontractor and actor Mohammed Ali, lives in exile in Spain, who launched the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a " millions-march " in central places in the country for this Friday. Ali calls for a " people's revolution. " The man is not a " good for most most young Egyptians because he raked millions as a subcontractor for the army, but his messages are arriving.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Regally, these figures could not be confirmed. The government also did government confirm or comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people had been " arbitrarily arrested " just because they were' in the wrong place at the wrong time', " HRW said, citing lawyers detainees. According to their lawyers, the charges against the detainees range from " disseminating misinformation " to membership in a " terrorist organization. " In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces interviewed and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothes, according to HRHRW arbitrarily passers-by.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: mail order companies should be able to donate returns easier
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be exempted from VAT on donations in kind, the ministry explained on a question the the Green parliamentary group, which the the newspapers of the Funke group reported on Friday. However, the traers could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they had to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens return every sixth parcel when orders on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - then ended up in the garbage. Donating them would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, the the authorities evaluate donations in kind as a turnover, which is then subject to VAT.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies can evaluate non-saleable products accordingly and donate them free of charge to non-profit organizations. Companies should be able to rely on not being punished for the donations. This applies not only to online trade, but also to other shops from the modeling shop to the Y store.
Banksy Art at the auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, " Devolved Parliament, " will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines " the regression of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude shaped by animals and strains. " From Saturday, the painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in south-west Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist exhibited the painting again - coinciding with the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work, formerly called " Question Time, " was renamed " Devolved Parliament. "
The picture could change hands for a million amount.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the first meeting of the House of Commons on Wednesday, after the lifting of a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court, a had a hard exchange with the opposition. Johnson wants to complete the Brexit, which already postponed twice on October 31, if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
This is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture depicting a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. Thousands of truck drivers and other visitors see the plant entering the UK every day.
Brexit debate is like a " walk in the park "
According to his top adviser, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fierfierce verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a " walk in the park, " Dominic Cummings said at a book launch on Friday. " We enjoy that. We will (leave the EU) and we will win. "
Johnson had harshattacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days, accusing them, among other things, of " betrayal " of the people. Accusations that he could put MPs in danger because they could become the target of death threats, he he dismissed as a " humbug. "
Cummings said that the only way to leave calm would be for MEPs would finally respected the British's decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were upset that the UK had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
Faced of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. " We should talk to each other with respect, " it statement statement said. " And we should also listen. "
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict during his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers Pakistan Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said at the UN general debate in New York on Friday. " If this goes badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst. " The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. " You should have prevented this. "
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India deprived the Indian Kashmir region of autonomy status and thus abruptly increased tensions in relations to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government reacts with a hard hand against the current protests in Egypt. It has live ammunition unition at at the population, more than 2,000 arrested ees join the prisons with the 60,000 political prisoners who are already there. Protesting has never been harmsafe in Egypt. However, since the rise to power of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario as in the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one's own government drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get a grip on, no matter how hard it is against adversaries. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, one in three in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces and much more. That was already the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people has a lot of experience, the dilemlemma the supermarket supermarket is an old one. It becomes critical whenever large parts of the population have difficulties to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv exams in the terminal: BER boss: No more " showstoppers " for capital airport
For two months, it was checked whether the complicated system network works together with BER fire protection. Operators are satisfied with the progress. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv audits in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the the opening in October next year. That's for certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory body.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed audit, but also said that there were still shortcomings to be processed in the terminal. " We have many detailed topics, but we do't have a real show stopper. " He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contained buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The completion notification is now to be submitted to the building authority during the first quarter of 2020, which this was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables still to be remedied; the Tüv intends to examine them by February. " In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work must still be continue to deal with the shortcomings, " said a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all dowels on which the cable routes hang. The airport manager expects that this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not yet work satisfactorily. The problems had led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time, it is about smoke aprons that shut down like a canvas in a fire so that the smoke does not spread. They drive down too far. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then, there should be new attempts with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and further construction defects as well as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. It was originally scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Since start of construction in 2006, costs have risen from two billion billion to around 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. This is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October will be, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. CFO Heike Fölster will join Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR Manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She had put the airport finances on firm feet.

The Viennese base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will thus de facto dissolved. Of the the seven seven Eurowings, four will remain in Vienna. AUA will take over over from January 2020 in the " Wetlease, " including Eurowings personnel. In future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which are to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Flights from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, explained the spokesman. Flight times are to be coordinated with connecting flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other, to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a " production company " for the Group sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be served with an AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings device. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but like the AUA in Terminal 3.
A price war broke out at Vienna Airport after the Niki bankruptcy. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced only on Thursday that it would increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airline is send four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called " wetlease, " which the union criticised as a bypass construct for the collective agreement.
The challenge of Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, AUA board Andreas Otto replied on Friday: " We will remain the number one at the site, in five, six or ten years. "

Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy eating - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers heart failure or infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
By analysing the genetic material of 9,000 people, people from Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to investigate the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davos High Mountain Hospital, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the main influable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors help determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known, it was said. Now, the scientists want to compare the complete genetic ome of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Cardiovascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - so-called - in 44000 of the 20,000 relevant human genes are known, according to the hospital. Every year, about 200 are added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options such such for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be used in the research of other widespread diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Cardiovascular Center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there is a firm will to use the data to research other diseases. So far, the foundation's clinic in Davos has primarily treated allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be created on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics should be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated open open surgery in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The organic samples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the " Hamburg City Health Study. " With 45,000 test persons, according to the hospital, this is the largest local health study in the world. According to the hospital, genetic attention is is paid to the protection of anonmised data, the scientists assured. It is about one petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, a human's genetic material can now be dephded within 24 hours hours The The material costs for this would be 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is to begin on 1 October, and all 9,000 samples are to be analyzed sed the end of 2020. Initial results are expected in the following year.
Nigerian police liberes hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to hinations from residents, security forces searched the school in the Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the partly still age victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. " The victims were mistreated, some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers, " Sabo said.
The boys were detained under the pretext of being taught and " improved " in the Koran. In fact, the protégés were detained by their teachers in " the most degrading and inhumane conditions, " Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the, the Koran school had existed for about ten years. Residents had drawn the attention of the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. Parparents were shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. According to the police, the operator and six employees were arrested.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have therefore across the border to the neighboring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chaained and Tortured: Nigeria's Police Rescut 400 Children from School
Police officers have freed nearly 400 students from appalling backgrounds in a school in northern Nigeria. " Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture, " said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
There the children had been discovered on Thursday after a hint in an Islamic school. The conditions there were " inhumane. " Officiofficials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held like slaves at their school and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television pictures showed emaciated and injured students in a noticeably poor health.
World Football Choice: Further accusations after Messis and Klopp's freestyle
Football " Signature not valid "
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Federation honhonFIFA the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations to FIFA come from other countries. Egypt was not evaluated at all - on a curious reason.
Much of FIFA has proved to be disreputable in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt functionaries. However, the FIFA footfootballer election has so far been suspected of running unclean - if one one from from the fact that voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote more on sympathy than on objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies now emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
FIFA apologizes in the extent that " the signatures on the election forms were given in capital letters and were therefore not valid. " The Egyptian association was contacted several times to clarify the situation - without a answer.
Sudan's coach also amazed
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three. According to FIFA, however, the vote was received the same, with signatures and official stamps of the Sudanese Association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also raised accusations: " Did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my vote is wrong, thank you, " he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on its behalf.
The news came from the association on Friday: True, but of course there was no intention. The completed election documents were " erronenly ously " with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was said in a message from the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had actually. " We take responsibility for the administrative error, " " the message said. However, both Rosand team coach Henry Henry arte arte voted for Messi, " just as it is in the official list of FIFA. "
FIFA has now having the other cases examined in an investigation, but stresses that the election process was externally supervised by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long long, Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world footballer election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: Senior RepubliRepublicans call for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly spoken out for an official investigation against US President and party colleague Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, " said Vermont Republican mont Governor Phil Scott. " Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are established. " He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking is taken. An pepement process can lead to the deremoval of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been observing Biden " for years. "
Republicans have so far refrained from criticising Trump for the whistleblower affair, few have shown unease about it. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party, with the moderate Virginia governor having already opposed Trump's policies several times, such as the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Another senior Republican was Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker called ated for the investigation. " It's a deeply disturbing situation, " Baker said. " The right approach and responsibility for Congress is is to investigate the and get to the bottom of it. "
As governors of US states, Scott and Baker have no formal say in the case against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore particularly symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first Republican senators have also been critical of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the Second Chamber of Parliament, said the case was " extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing. " US media also report that there were the first ricks among Republicans internally.
The affair could result in the opening of impeachment proceedings against Trump, and the House Democrats have announced an investigation, accusing him of abuse of power for foreign interference for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for impeachment. With their majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats could initian so-called impeachment, but the decision on actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. so the prospects of success of such a process are slim. far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment process.
Were torturers on board Rackete's " Sea Watch "?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily and raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had unailed for the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship " Sea Watch 3 " and 53 Libyrefugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations are being made against Rackete. Three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the " Sea-Watch 3. " The suspects were caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. " We cannot rule out this, but we have no reliable information themselves, " said " Sea Watch " spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). " The migrants were systematically harassed subjected subjected atatrocities through repeated and constant physical violence, " the statement said at the time.
NGO and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. " We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports, " said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. " It is therefore very important that this is investigated. "
Italy's right-wing former Interior minister Matteo Salvini immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
Musk aims for tradition record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record figures.
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, " Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek. "
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could record 110,000 orders, continued to Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customers quickly. To do this, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares left trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased so strongly for almost four months. Tesla had had delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures are needed in the current and next quarter of a year. Above, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but above the the profit profit margins are low.
US budget dispute: Again only one bridge financing
The new fiscal year will begin in the US on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided to provide transitional financing until November 21.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without without spending plans before the new fiscal year beginning on October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and adopted a Contining Resolution (CR) by November 21. Without such a decision, there would have been a shutdown on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration President Trump still has to put the decision into decision.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration is now being financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019 that ending on Monday. This because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, for the federal being for the time being being benefit from the expanded expenditure framework from 1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion for the new financial year.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are barely majority.
The ghosts differ mainly on the issue of resource allocation for the area of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the Wall, one of President Trump's major priorities. The Democrats are bothered by the construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the construction of the Wall the ghosts part
It is currently unclear how the parties intend to get closer to this issue. More probable than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November. Even a shutdown is also not excluded.
Against the background of the continuing inability of Congress to agree in time on the twelve spending laws, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automautomof the process are gaining popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the financing of the federal administration would automatically continue at the previous year's level, prevent the travel activities of parliamentarians and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill according to all all women use in vitro fertilisation. Thus, the demand for anonymous sperm donations is likely to increase significantly.
The proposal still still to the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that in future future " children without a father " could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also opposed to the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an " opportunity " for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the costs of artificial insemination for all women are to be borne by social security.
Fertilization with sperm of dead husband further forbidden
By a narrow majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great United Kingdom, insememination " post-mortem " is allowed. In Germany, there have been cases in the past where women complained in vain for the release of the sperm of a deceased person. Opponents of the advance in Paris argued that such a conceived child then had a " particularly difficult fate. "
Numerous deputies of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on the ve, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and deputies of the opposition had spoken out in favour of artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They emphasized that a widow would be subjected a " double grief " if the death of her husband would left her desire to have children unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair for a widow to be able to be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown person in the future, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for climate: calls for flight tax for universities get louder
There is a lot of flown at universities, which is why the country wants to have a climate tax there in the future. The rectors say that they have no money for it. But now they are also coming under internal pressure.
Universities should also limit strict flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion postponed before the summer break about a climate tax on flights from universities and colleges is gaining momentum again. After the state Rectors' Conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical ical university ad for a compensation for business flights. This is " urgently necessary " as a first step " at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, says statement states. Meanwhile, the cabinet decision originally planned in July is still on hold, because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia arrested North Korean fishermen again
According to the secret service FSB, the detainees fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had already been arrested. At that time, there was an exchange of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were were injured, the fisherman man later succumbed to his serious injuries.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, which means why North Korean fishermen were travelled in Russian territorial waters, where, according to their own statements, the Russian Coast Guard patrolling to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squid confiscated
During the new checks, 30,000 squid were discovered and confiscated on the boats. Moreover, according to the data, three fishing and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Nhoodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Even after lawsuits by local entrepreneurs, Russia's fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to North Koreans this year. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high damage damage by North Korean fishermen They fished with narrow-knmessynthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also also used to small organisms organisms of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed.
Only 18,000 in 18future: USA lolower asylum ceiling
The " most generous nation in history ": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country on earth is closing itself off from those seeking protection: as the State Department confirms Washington Washington, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be further lowered. In the future, threatened believers and qqis in particular will receive asylum.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees again. In the 2020 financial year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the US State Department explained. In the almost past fiscal year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump's administration has drastically lowered the readtivity of those seeking protection from around the world in recent years. Under Barack Obama's previous administration, far higher reception limits had applied.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee program in 1980. Nevertheless, the State Department described the US as " most most pitiful and generous nation in history, " a formulation that strongly reminiscent of the incumbent US president's language.
A " responsible approach " of refugees aims to enable the refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump explained. He receives a lot of support from supporters for his hard course in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal off. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a time connection between the current measure and the current domestic policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selensky affair and a possible impending impeachment procedure.
According to the Foreign Office, the US government wants to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees future people who who are persecpersecbecause of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus been at danger, as the statement of the State Department. On the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken in from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The US wants people from this " northern triangle " of Central America in particular particular to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has first concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration on the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
At the request of the Argentine judiciary, an orangutan female has been transferred from the former Zoo of Buenos Aires to a sanctuary for great apes in the USA. Born in 1986 in Rostock Zoo, the " Sandra " was granted the rights of a " non-human person, " so her release was mandatory. The animal was brought by direct by to Dallas on Thursday evening - not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human girl is unable to adapt to life in the wild, she is supposed to live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. There are already house 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them " Bubbles, " former pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida Florida, however, " Sandra " has to endthrough a 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, " Sandra " spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The trial for " Sandras " fundamental rights, initiated by animal rights activists in 2014, has contributed to the transformation of the Buenos Aires Zoo into an ec@-@ park. By 2023, a research and educational institution for the preservation of biodiversity is to be built there.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussar ride on the almost 3000-metre-high Great Pinnacle in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double ground or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550-metre-high north face of the Großer Pinnacle in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, t-shirt and only supported by absolute vertigo, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus he undercut the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder in free solo speed on four of the six most important European north faces.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sporting goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profits. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars in the quarter under review (just under 1.3 billion euros), 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy " Nike Direct, " with which the Adidas competitor addresses its customers online online.
Sales rose to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period to the end of August. Nike sales figures rose sharpstrongly in China with an increase of 22 percent. Thus, the group from Beaverton in the US state of Oregon also benefited in the People's Republic of its approach of targeting consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
CFO Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the " digital transformation " of the sporting goods manufacturer with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors responded with ily to the quarterly figures - the sporting goods manufacturer's shares increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban due to racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about professional pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. Brazil-born defender ender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. " @ officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. # NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am, " wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing for AS Rom since 2016.
The club reacted late Thursday. He had reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma supporter was never allowed to attend a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. " We cannot have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums, " FIFA President Gianni Infantino said at the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist chants at the first division match between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florenz last Sunday.
But there had also been recent discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rioting fans of record champion JuventJuventus Turin. Four of them are no longer likely to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. Accordingly, bans of four to seven years apply to the rest.
The fans are in contact with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups in the around Juventarea. The twelve are accused of severe extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club launched the investigation with an advertisement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are behind the black market with tickets. They would have " militarily controlled " the ticket trade for the fan curve and are said to have blackmailed Juventus employees in order to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - entire vinare ages are given names. If you take a more look, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective attitude to life of young people?

Conflict between Iran and the US: Ruhani talks of end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
On his return from the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions. The United States had promised an end to all sanctions in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump disagreed with the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: " Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there be a meeting. I said, of course, no. "
Ruhani describes the events as follows: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted on a meeting to take place. " And America says I am lifting the sanctions, " added Ruhani. The nature of the punitive measures that should be ended have up under discussion. " And they have clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions. "
However, this move was not made in an acceptable way, criticized Ruhani. In view of the current punitive measures and " the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure, " no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York, The background was Europeans' hope to save the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated with Russia and China, which should prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday, This concerns of a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged damaged The earthquake magnmagnitude 5.of on had shook the Marmara region off Istanbul and triggered panic in the metropolis of millions. Now, the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built houses collapcollapse - among other things, worn down by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which were registered registered the center center as refuge, have long since been added. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük quake in August, the Chamber of Civil Engineering of Istanbul had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of Thursday's quake was located in the Sea of Marmara in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometres, as the civil protection authority Afad reported. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu announced on Twitter that injured or damage had not been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some students cried, as can be seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the quake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake with a magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. The earthquake on Thursday again hit the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private individuals have packed so-called go bags with everything they need to stand next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wobbles. When the next big quake will come is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people had been injured and Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul's Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques collapsed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On social networks, many users report panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than Tuesday's, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official figures, the time of the quis given as 1.: 59 (local time). Only a few minutes after the first earthquake, according to CNN Turkey, there was an aftershock, which was given with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday, an earthquake with a magnitude of 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was until Istanbul.. epicicwas also located in the Sea of Marmara west of the metropolis of millions, the civil protection authority Afad announced already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It has made more likely, he told CNN Türk. " These could be the signs of a major earthquake, " Ersoy said to the transmitter. " Sooner or later the big quake will also come. "
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake also caused great concerns in Istanbul. In Albania, addition, there had been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. The earth had also shaken on Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: New fuel in the Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment procedure, the US Democrats are encouraged: the complaint submitted by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial telephone call with the Ukrainian president provide important clues for investigations against the president. Trump himself once again sees himself as victim of a " witch hunt. " He also doubted the the whistleblower's credibility.

McEwan was quoted as saying: " When parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers shamelessly lie like the Soviet leaders once did, when Brexiteers in high positions almost ore the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write. " By McEwan, the novel " Machines like Me " on artificial intelligence appeared only in the spring.

Prince Harry destroys explosive mine in Angola
Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana's engagement for a long time. In Africa, he is now walking directly in his mother's footsteps.
Dressed in a blue splinter vest, the British Prince Harry detonated and destroyed an explosive event in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he produced the ignition circle in front of running TV cameras on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded in the savanna landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk in the city of Huambo directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same explosive master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to travel the path she went at the time. The pictures in which Princess Diana walked through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone the world. She too had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, starting in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Standalling Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly defined: he will certainly not be a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements are already of lasting lasting in the polarizing British. The recent ruling of of the Court in Court flovers like a sword of Damocles over the head of blhead. His suspension of parliament in order to be able to stubly conduct his Brexit course until the exit date was stubannulled earlier this week. And a law passed by parliament obliges Johnson to effect an extension of bilateral bilateral in the event of failed negotiations with the EU the 31 However, Johnson had categorically excluded this.
Boris Johnson still considers deal possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass Johnson Johnson noticeably either. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he hinted that in the event of a disagreement, he support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we will stick bey the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will be leaving the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is gradually running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have about six weeks to prevent the UK's withdrawal from the European Union without an agreement. However, even the recent talks have not achieved a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October currently seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a renewed postponement of the withdrawal date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words. It fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US agency: Further deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the USA has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injured in this context, the US health authority CDC reported. According to a study in the " New England Journal of Medicine, " there have already been more than 900 affected, around 500 of them confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unclear. No similar increase in lung damage is known known in Europe. The aints seem to be limited to users in the USA.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
The videos of Mohammed Ali were shared into millions times into online networks. The building contractor and actor living in in Spain calls for a " people's revolution. " For this Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass rallies with one million participants in central places in the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. An increased police presence had already been observed in the center of Cairo. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in recent days, the police had already strengthened their road controls and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians partly for news and photos in connection with the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces rereacted harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were " in the wrong place at the wrong time, " HRW informed arrested, citing lawyers.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially convicted in recent years.
" Ocean Change ": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival at the Port of Hamburg, he was welcomed by the skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg, had brought across the Atlantic with the racing yacht " Malizia. "
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the consequences of global warming in recent months on his sailing ship " Dagmar Aaen " on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar explorer. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak up. It has been known for decades that the Earth was warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
" What happens at sea often takes place in secret, " said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the litter of the oceans. Among other things, Greenlanglacier ice was measured with acier ice with a drone and fished with nets for microplastics, it was said.
For his " struggle for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans, " the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the " Seadevcon Maritime Award " during Hamburg Climate.. " For all of us who care the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model, " said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. " He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades. "
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: that seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. Included the bill with 80 euros tip was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
" Such cases damage the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to investigate the question of whether this is a fraud, " demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant came promp. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this cannot be ferred from the bill. Also, a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, said the innkeeper.
A call to Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump may indeed face imimachment proceedings after the turbulent revelations in recent days, the Democrats now want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - there is talking of weeks before a decision is made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The accusation of the whistleblower, who finally brought the conversation to the public out of of concern for national security and democracy with his complaint, is monstrous: the president had abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country to influence the 2020 election. He had extortionexploited Ukraine's dependence and thus wanted to force it to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be seen in the now published transcript of the conversation with Zenensky, although it does not reflect the full wording. However, the telephone call of July 25 is only one episode of a much larger story, which focuses, next to Trump above all on his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view, the story begins in May 2019, when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected President Selensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. " We do not interfere in an choice, we interfere ere in investigation investigation what we have the right to, " he tells the newspaper. One might think it is inappropriate, but " there is nothing about it.. Giuliani ani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine for which there is hardly any basis - " because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could turn out to be helpful to my government. "
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had spspded with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the, to construct an occasion for the Russia investigation in the US, But this accusation could never be taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk so prominently about the the with with ensensky in July. Giuliani and the president's version reads: the former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy, Joe Biden, as the Ukraine representative of the Obama administration,, urged for the dismissal of then then Ukrainian AttGeneral Viktor Schokin in in order to stop the investigation he investigation of the gas company, on whose supervisory his son Hunter Biden worked. Biden senior had blackmailed Ukraine financially to cover up his family's corrupt machinations.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General leave, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, and Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Moreover, Schokin was was accused of deeply corrupt behavior, and the US government was by no means the only Western partner puspush for his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media is down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances to Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, Germany, Great Britain and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not repeatedly upading since about 3.30 pm. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disruption, although not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disturbances
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And, as in the previous cases, users again mainly on Twitter to vent their anger.
Polish scientists resin in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were traveling in rubber dinghy and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - it took the Chilean rescue helicopter less than an hour to rescue them.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
" At 9: 30 a.m. we received the news, just before ten we started, and a good 20 minutes later we were above the rubber dinghy. "
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, where 19 scientists work there. Frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: NEVER charging smartphone wirelessly
Practical, but harmful
Inductive technology via QQi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come onto the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Although wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick, this is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat generation. If a mobile phone is charged normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. During wireless charging, however, the researchers have always measured over 30 degrees even even the perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging path. If the mobile phone is a little next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wt age of the charging pad also increases, which in turn increases the power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but it also does last last so long overall. Thus, the service life is lower. Therefore, the researchers advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery replacement on modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the costs of a battery replacement - - for all iPhones.
Praktisch
The technology is extremely convenient: simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable clutter and tedious plug-in cheting. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) asseris a worldwide standard, in which exceptionally even Apple participates, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest traffic jam photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
According to his own statements, a Nepalese climber climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within only six months. Nirmal Purja (36) had reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition operator said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project " Mission Possible. " He has already made international headlines: He took a viral photo of climbers queuing on Mount Everest in spring.
The image of the mass ds triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8,848-meter-high mountain and highest peak on earth. In May, eleven climbers died on the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China to enable it to climb.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. " We suspect that the elephants were poisoned. "
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously kept harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants remain in Sri Lanka. Theoretically, their killing is the death penalty.
British British oil tanker leaves Iran

Management of Thomas Cook in the criticism
The responsible economic committee of the House of Commons wants to fully investigate the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook with the Board's salary packages as well as the question of why the British government did not want to contribute financially to the struggling survival. " We are interested in supervision of the company as well as the control by external accountants, " committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. " Apparently we are dealing with a bad example of management greed. "
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the familially increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently so far been overestimated. This is to the conclusion of researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits therefore probably weigh more heavily than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual colorectal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk boosts Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog " Electrek. " The demand was strong, so that Tesla could record 1000 orders, Musk's newsletter continued.
The challenge is to bring the cars to customers quickly. To do this, Tesla had to find as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares left trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not risen so strongly for almost four months. Tesla had delivered a good good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures are needed in the current and upcoming quarter of a year. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here, the profit margins are low.
Will British government circumvent Brexit law? Johnson reluctined
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covered about whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the the recently ununBrexit Brexit an unby Brexit. On a question, he merely told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request for a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement has been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a " surrender law " that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major suggested that Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that postpone the entry into force of the law to the period after the withdrawal from the EU.
Johnson said he is seeking a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is with an agreement. "
Iran apparently booup uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on the European contractors in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal. " Unfortunately, the European states show inability or unwillingness when it comes to concrete action, " Rouhani said at a press conference on the sidelines of UN General Assembly in in York York. In the event they did not by their promises, he held the the ect of " further steps " away from the agreements of the painstakously negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US withdrew from the agreement on its own in 2018 in order to force Iran to change course in the Middle East policy, was considered aggressive with " maximum pressure. " President Donald Trump's administration wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now relying on tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran has recently responded by restarting the uranium enrichment limited by the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium or at least prepared them for use. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not willing to bear their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rouhani suspected. But there will still be further talks that would hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the situation changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the Britain followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen committed responsibility for the attack, but this was seen by the US as a wrong commitment. " We have nothing to do with, " RouRohani reiaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
" Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this, " Rouhani said. However, European leaders could not have done so in the talks with him during the UN General debate. Instead, they would only inved that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration had have to be lifted, Rouhani demanded. He called on the Washington government to switch to a policy of " dialogue and reason. "
Comet crossed crossed by other star Solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This was only achieved before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was christened 2I / Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The well-travelled comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-made telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter. Follow-observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not come from our solar system.
After 1I /' Oumuamua in 2017, 2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be seen during a flight of our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to gain close insights into a foreign solar system before it disappears forever again again Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary aries reported. " The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which at this distance is well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the Sun, " reported Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa in a statement.
According to the analyses, the comet is on a so-called hyperboola orbit that leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially listed under the catalog number C / 2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I / Borisov, whereby the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I /' Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in approach. This, the researchers have many months to investigate. " The object will reach its brightness in mid-December December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020, " explained Farnocchia. " Thereafter, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020. "
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I /' Oumuamua, determined diameter diameter of celsky object object over 2 16 16 kilometers in a first study. Images from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astastrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. " The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar, " reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how such such visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly be intercept a planned satellite mission by the European space agency Esa.
The agency wants to station the three-part spacecraft " Comet Interceptor " (et interceptor) at a position 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 20. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it will either lurwait for a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor such as 1I /' Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, the time has come: A first China United Airlines passenger aircraft has landed at the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honour for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are to be handled annually at the new airport, and it expected to be 72 million by 2025. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China's latest prestige project is also called " starfish " because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new sub@-@ subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had announced announced several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the - smaller - capital in Germany,, which has been under construction since 2006, has so far repeatedly repeatedly postponed. Beijing Beijing, on the other, a a a aircraft passenger plane landed after only four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly 2030: from London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams of this this. This should be made possible by this flight, targeted for the 2030s by a supersonic drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire develops developing the US station CNN quoted the the agency. " This is the technology that definitely definitely do this, " agency manager Graham Turnock told the station. " We talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced. "
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency intends to work more closely with the Australian one. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to date, Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until the closure of operations operations 2003 2003 and took three three and a half hours. In 2000 2000 there was an accident during the launch of a Concorde at Paris Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, in which all 109 occupants were killed. Last year, the American aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonaircraft together with the US space agency Nasa, the " X-Plane. " Virgin Galactic also has such developments in its program.
" Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport, " writes Reaction Engines on his homepage, among others. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabling the " next generation of truly reusable frame devices. "
Riot in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tipators in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair over US President's possible abuse of power, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
" I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information, " Trump told employees of the US legation to the United Nations in New York on Thursday. The person concerned was almost " a spy " and has been treated " a little differently " in the past than they is today.
This was seen an attempt at intimidation against tipters. Actually, the event was not public. However, several US media distributed audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced on Tuesday preparations for impeachment proceedings against Trump. Their allegations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who makes serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. Under great public pressure, the whistleblower's accounts were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received information from several government officials that the US president " uses the power of office " to ensure make another country intervene in the 2020 US election in his favor.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden, involving former deals of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is leading the lead for the Democratic presidential bid for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukraine telephone call: Leading government employees had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the roof. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been drawn up. However, this had been removed from a normally database database the White House after the conversation on the instructions of lawyers and instead stored in a particularly protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that he was an employee of the CIA.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the " so-called whistleblower " had spread second-hand information that turned out to be incorrect, so, there may be no tippers or spies.
But how Trump spoke in New York about those who supposedly leaked information to the whistleblower spoused ed outrage. US House Representatives Chairman Nancy Pelosi responded with concern, complaining that Trump's statement once again undermined the government's integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his environment have various in various committees committees months. In In light of Ukraine's allegations, the Democrats are now pushing with investigations with new force in order to launch a possible impeachment procedure against Trump.
" The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation, " said the head of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of misrepresenting things, and once again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insults Schiff and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former security and foreign foreign policy officials, most of whom worked under Democratic and Republican presidents, backed a statement published on Friday behind the Democrats-" investigation into a possible impeachment trial. If the allegations were true, it would be " an unscrupulous abuse of power " by Trump, it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats could pursue a so-called impeachment procedure, but the decision on actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority, so the prospects of success in such a process are slim. far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment process.
VW Works Council: Jobs to be cut " creeping "
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the car manufacturer's works council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023. Of which, 500 million euros are to be saved already this year.
One key to this is personnel costs. The " Future Pact " negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basiprinciple, a job can only be cut at the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security applies until 2029.
As our newspaper has now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production which were were not actually for sale, are " creeping " reduced by another way - in other words, past the official course. Thus, vacant regular positions would often not be refilled.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility to force the resstoment. Meanwhile, there is no staff in many places, the compression of work is increasing, the fears of a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would become greater. Thus, the fear is also that the vehicle production could be be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. It was only said of VW: " An adjustment of the employment volume takes place as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve. "
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and manage new projects centrally. This, too, to to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - behind this is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Chief Production Officer Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: " Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof. "
There are already successes in this way: for example, this year, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be tened by 1.1 hours. VW does not give exact figures on the production time, according to information from our newspaper, it is around for the Golf 7.
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb within ally VW is that 800,000 cars must be built there every year in order that the plant satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining demand for diesel and the problems with the conversion to the new consumption and exhaust test method WLTP.
However, as Production manager Tostmann announced last year, one million cars are to roll off the production line in Wolfsburg " in perspective perspective. This is intended to make it possible to bundgolf production at the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is giving over golf production by converting it to a location for e-car production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of the Gulf and Tiguan recently declined. Therefore, expectations are now suspended on the Gulf 8. Despite all efforts to build e-mobility, it should remain the bread-and-butter car of the Wolfsburgers for the time being.
Forced into prostitution with voodoo: traffickers in omned
Young women from Nigeria have been swith oaths, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected traffickers are forced to sent to prison.
Six suspected traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and prison terms of up to eight years and three months in um on Friday Friday. defendants had sgeled young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian women willing to leave leave had had to take a ritual oath at front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in dinghboats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed to different brothels in order to process the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25 000 euros. Therefore the wages therefore completely taken from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the infiltration and subsequent distribution of young Nigerian women on brothels at the trial. " The work made women physically and mentally difficult for women, " said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. " Some were really disgusted. "
The judgments are to commercial and band infiltration of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendant union Ufo has once again threatened stristrike.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will " inform about the industrial action measures in the LH Group on 14 October, " UFO collective ff Officer Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with Ufo for months, also on the question of whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to establish that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company upheld the decision and examined to ing against it. " I think it is unlikely that a second court sees the matter a completely differently, " said Ufo Executive Board Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Frankfurt Regional Labour Court to have the status of the UFO as a trade union reviewed in court. The company argues that the trade union had not set up a board board of representation for months and is therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the trade union, in the course of which numerous members of the board and the advisory board resigned, including the long-time union leader Nicoley Baublies. Ufo had suspended an already begun ballot vote about strikes by cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July because of the doubts about its leadership.

Saudi Arabia is currently difficult difficult to tourists. Visas usually only issued only for business business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes for more income from the tourism business. According to its own, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production collapsed dramatically, oil oil shots soed. It is likely to take several weeks for the Kingdom's oil production to return to its old level.

Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also the causes of the threat, reported the International Union for Conservation servation (IUCN) in Brussels on Friday. It examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of which do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 58 are are threatened. are are already at the highest level of risk and thus facing extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from " potentially endangered " to " endangered, " " endangered, " " endangered " and " extinct in nature " to " extinct. " Overall, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
rowan and wild horse chestnut in threat
In Germany, rowans (Sorbus) are particularly threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, told the German Press Agency. " Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats. "
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered " endangered " since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat fungfungus the the minth in addition to a moth. It has been spreading from southeast Europe across the entire continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 specimens. The trees in cities, parks and avenues are not considered in this assessment.
Shrubs and mosses also in danger
The IUCN scientists, the same time compiled new European Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of the mollusand and mosand almost almost of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails have played a key in in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an source food source for birds and other animals.
" This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet, " said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europa Office. " We need limit limit human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority. "

United States warns federal government of Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great, " Pai told Handelsblatt with a view to setting up the new 5G mobile network.
China has a " national security law " that obliges every company " under Chinese jurisdiction " to obey instructions from the security forces.
Current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties of such requests, " continued the FCC CEO, This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to demand a " declaration sttruthiness " from suppliers.
Berlin initially wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the " Handelsblatt, " citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The G G technology consists not consist of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, " said Pai.
It is " very hard to imagine " that a government agency, " no matter where, would be able to check each update in real time to identify security risks, " the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership structure are opaque and the employee company that suppogedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government, " Pai told the " Handelsblatt. "
The US had insights that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently in favor of talks in Berlin to promote the US position.

French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more investments to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better, " said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for next year.

British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticises the " surrender law " passed by Parliament.
The parliament is back, a law requires the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, when about this possibility, the Tory politician evades.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covered about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the law recently passed by Parliament, which is supposed to prevent exactly that. When asked that question, Johnson merely told journalists that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a " surrender law " that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major suggested ected Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law. The Prime prime Minister use use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until the period after the withdrawal from the EU. Johnson said he is seeking a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident of leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is with an agreement. "
Meanwhile's Johnson's chief advis, Dominic Cummings, said that he saw the political utes over Brexit as a " walk in the park " and was confident that the desired exit from the EU would still come about: " We enjoy this, we will win, we will (editor's note: leave the EU), don't worry, " Cummings said to the British newspaper " Telegraph " at a book launch.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign " Vote Leave " during the election campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as chief strategist in the British government in Downing Street. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policy that have led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.
" The Polaroid Diaries " by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they were all in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book " The Polaroid Diaries " delves deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the illustrated book " The Polaroid Diaries " at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. Illustrious guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: " # ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family Instagram family, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a dedicated artist, and the instant magic of Polaroid film. "
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, several hundred of which are now published for the first time in " The Polaroid Diaries. "
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. " She wanted real moments, " writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course, one is always the focus: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen seen before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, calls in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears misshapen Moon boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also led a normal life beyond the spotlight light on their in southern England or in Scotland. Mary McCartney said according to the BBC that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And it was not always tidy with the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's photographs are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to take it at exactly the right moment, " said Paul McCartney. " If you shoot two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo. " And Linda would have had the gift of always turing exactly the right moment. " She just knew she had it, " Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the image detail and the colors are right, which makes " The Polaroid Diaries " " not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but in addition to everything anecdotal is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also look like abstract paintings. The perfect complement to the newly released Beatles album " Abbey Road, " which was released exactly 50 years ago.
" We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran "
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from its neighboring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, " said Erdogan in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had " withdrawn because of US threats. "
Nevertheless, Turkey will " continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues, " said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since leaving the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has been pursuing a policy of " maximum pressure " on the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not abide by the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the slump of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, Tensions in the Gulf region have worsened considerably in recent months.
US government wants to restrict reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. Thursday, the US State Department declared that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be reduced from the current current 0,000 to 18,000 refugees, which corresponds to a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said that while the US remains committed to supporting refugees, the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overburdened.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on the reception of two refugee groups: people who are being persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus been at danger, as the State Department statement statement. However, a maximum of a 1,500 refugees are to be taken in from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The program launched in 1980 selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles in the US. 18,000 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program's history. Even the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When US President Donald Trump's predecessor Barack Obama left the White House, the number was just under 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted in horror to the announced lowering of the upper limit. " This is a very sad day for America, " said David Miliband Committee Chairman Rescue band, the US would further damage damage its leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US - legally and illegally. According to its own information, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - " Come close to a spy "
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers in the whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever has punched hines to the informant who accuses him of abuse of power " comes close to a spy, " Trump said, according to a record of a private event in New York on Thursday, several US media agree.
Accordingly, Trump spoke to employees of the American UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, " This comes to a a y.. " Trump added: " Do you know what we did in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a bit differently than we do now. "
Observers evaluated the latter remark to a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats strongly criticized Trump's statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. It was also an attempt attempt obstruct a congressional inquiry into a possible impeachment case against him, wrote the chairs of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Supersight Committees.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a recently published complaint of having abused his office to ask for interference from another country in the 2020 US election. Specifically, it is about his controversial telephone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in the summer: In the conversation, Trump advised him to launch an investigation against his possible Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower himself and his informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst for the CIA.

Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from a small startup to a driving force in the world's most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords must fear for billions in revenues.
The crisis of the office landcompany WeWork threatens to disset the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. A few days ago, the company sold founder Adam Neumann as boss, postponed the planned IPO and started selling sell subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for executives in order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British " Financial Times, among among others, reports that WeWork had stopped the completion of new rentals with immediate effect. Thus, the largest tenant of office space suddenly from the market in New York and London, among other things.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and rents out to members at short notice in sometimes small units. These can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has burned money at a breathtaking speed with this business. Last year, the company made a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs are said to have risen to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars by renting ever new large areas. In order to limit the loss, the new company management is now said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped the rental of new space with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with maturities of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion, which that could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, has ased almost 300,000 square meters of office space in the past 24 months. WeWorks new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new space on the market at that time. Without WeWorks expansion, the office vacancy in the US metropolis ropolis have have during this time, as Alpert pert wrote the " Business Insider. " The situation is similar in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in a prime location.
In the British capital, too, the balance in the real estate market could shift noticeably without a further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant in an office building bought last year by the Sparkassen fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would have to write off part of the hoped-for billions in revenues. They do not have access to the - already scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term leases. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually done by specially founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose les, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen

" As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he heads a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.

New climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets once again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide. New Zealand and Australia are likely to start because of the time difference, before the protests spread across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How great the global popularity this Friday after last week's record participation will be is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was in good spirits. " Last Friday, more than four million people went strike for the climate. We'll do it again this Friday! " she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6,383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
Especially in Germany, the influx last Friday was very large. According to estimates by Fridays Future, a good third of all demonstrators - around 1.4 million - took part in the protests in 575 German cities. This time, according to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg sat down before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of their country to make greater commitment to climate protection. This resulted in the Fridays for Future movement within a short period of time. Pupils and students are involved in the climate protests, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politicians in the fight against global heating and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be reduced to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived in New York almost a month ago after a two-week transatlantic cruise with a deep-sea racing yacht, There she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the the United Nations. On Monday she gave an an emotional speech at the UN in which she spoke strongly to the heads of state and government of the earth in their conscience. In her home country Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia bbits smoking on the balcony
In the future, people in Russia will no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony, which provides for a change in fire protection. " This also applies to smoking, " said a spokesman for the emergency of Ministry in Moscow on Thursday, according to the Tass agency. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes nevertheless must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should light a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the ministry, the prohibition includes equally burning candles Even grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Strike against cybercriminals - investigators lift servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time excavated a large server provider for illegal transactions on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data data in in a NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, through which internationally active criminals pursued their machinations.
This was announced by the Attorney General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world's second largest Darknet marketplace for drugs, " Wall Street Market " - which investigators had smashed in the spring. According to the Prosecutor's Office, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyberbunker.
Such a hoster was excavated for the first time in Germany, it was said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access campaign with the support of special forces such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigation. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets once again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia and Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests ǀ Who are Thunberg's backers?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more astonishing that a 16-year-old girl of all people holds holds the mirror front nose face the the power people of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and gets young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win over a collection of children and young people. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a more er world. At that time, he was also won over a crowd of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea to enter the promised land,, to how Greta Thunberg recently made his trip to America with a sailboat.
But is there a dark side in this regard? Why does it need a share called " We don't have time " to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By cidentally, her mother has published a book that which has sold far large extent, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Even well-tried followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably also set too thick for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because because the came came into its own in the media worldwide and a lot of money flows thanks to imposing action.
Here the spirits are now ating: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially in saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together with stock market brokers during the world rescue campaign? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically influenced society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can certainly make sense to critically question seemingly pious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A foreign comet is currently warting our solar system.
The astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: a foreign comet is crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star is currently interting our solar system. It was christened after its discoverer 2I / Borisov and currently employying astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov in Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-made telescope and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to be sighted during passing through.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain close insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the coming is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Astastrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC, the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperboola orbit that leads it out of our system.
Comet has been sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before that happens, astronomers can observe it in detail, because, unlike its predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in its approach, which means that it can be studied from Earth for many months. " The object will reach its highest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible with-@-@ sized telescopes by April 2020, " explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa. " After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020. "
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 " Oumuamua. "
First findings on comet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at a diameter of 2 to 16 kilometres. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comet - because as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years may allow a new way of researating certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again asteroids occupy the researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid raced past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
" Absolutely reprehensible ": Rachel Johnson horrified by brother
It becomes more lonier about Boris Johnson. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister cascourges with clear words the warlanguage of the prime minister as " tasteless. " It is not the brother she knows.
" Surrender, " " fraud, " treaty ": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to arm - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this met with massive outrage from the opposition, and in the meantime other critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words such as surrender as as the opponents of an the exit should be " hanged, dragated, quartered, tarred and fehioned. " She thought this is extremely reprehensible. She does not recognize her brother's version, said Rachel Johnson sons, who stood for the anti-Brexit party " Change UK " in the EU Parliament elections.
She particularly particularly across the mentioning her brother Jo Cox, an pro-EU Member of who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi Nazi a few days before the 2016 exit referendum. Their memory could best be honored by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. " It is very tasteless to refer to a MP who was murdered by someone who shted' Britain first', " now criticized Johnson's sister. The perpetrator obviously came from the far-right camp, which felt " " by this kind of language. " For all who mourned her, it was very tasteless.
Cox's widower also sharply criticized the Prime Minister. " It makes me sick when Jo's name is used that way, " he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to stand passionately and resolutely for what you believe in - no matter what one believe think. but you should never " demonize the other side. " He also complained that an atmosphere had emerged in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory deputy. " I have been torn apart between loyalty to the family and the national interest in recent months - it's an indissoluble tension, " Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson's language also met with harsh criticism in the Church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is " not worthy of this country. " In a joint statement they declared: " In recent days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside the parliament. We should speak to each other with respect. "

The announcement of half-time guests is eagerly awaited every time in the US. This year, many also see the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle.

In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a Super Bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The appearance of the rock group Maroon 5 was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber adds Egypt's ruler: For for time being being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men, who have influence over whether blood flows flowing on the streets of Egypt, both spent last week abroad. One of them flovered back at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned returned the the UN General Assembly. Ex-general, who deposed the Muslim Brotherhood MohMohamed Morsi the first country freely first head of state state in 2013 had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's crackdown on political Islam and had not lost a syllable about the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president. He had " no reason to worry, " SSisi at the airport in the microphones of state television. " The Egyptians are not misled. "
According to the President, this is misattempted by the other man who is currently determinating the events on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he elades the grip of the security forces, who would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor to only a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the caf, cafrooms and living rooms and tea rooms: with his YouTube channel " Mohammed's secrets, " Ali calls on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He approaches the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president indulels in luxury and lets magnificent new palaces be built, it is said. Ali accuses the army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with precisely these gentlemen for 15 years in his second job as a contractor, he seems to know quite well what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding click numbers show.
After thousands had demonstrated against his rule last week for the first time since Sisi's grip on power and almost 2000 citizens, including prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a " marof march " for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would really venture onto the the. However, there there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giza near Cairo and in the village of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests whose participants participants Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests protests the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos could not not be independently verified. From security circles, it was said that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators tore banners with the portrait of the president to pieces last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and on the arterial roads. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed for " maintenance work, " most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on Rabaa Square, where supporters of the overthrown Muslim Brotherhood Morsi entrenched themselves until 2013 until army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure intended to prevent dissatisfied people from gathering: Sisi isi Future Future wanted wanted hold hold major major rfor for the here.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: " Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square, " Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. " Let's not clash with police officers. " But as a retreat this is not to be understood: " All of Egypt is Tahrir Square. "
If the provider promises too much power
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options.
Anyone who conclude an Internet contract does not need to blindly trust the speed information of the providers. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved in case of abnormalities.
After all, the previously promised transfer rates are a contract component and should therefore also be achieved, explains the consumer association Bavaria.
If the connection always seems to be slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. The measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
" However, the tests of the providers are carried out according to vendor-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively, " says the consumer association Bavaria on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised service. It is best to do this affected in writing by letter of letter.
If this does no effect even after several requests, customers can terminate and possibly also demand damages. However, in the absence of success, only the way of action will help.
First Senior Republican for Investigation
As the first senior Republican, Vermont Governor has in favor of an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are established, " Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action - an impeachment process can lead to the removal of the president - is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden " for years. "
Republicans have so far refrained from criticising Trump for the whistleblower affair; few have shown disease about it. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already opposed Trump's policies on several occasions, such as easing environmental regulations regulations and tightening immigration regulations.

Allegedly, Jaqueline Ng was assured an upgrade by email from Cathay Pacific. However, when she she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for Business Class - many passengers dream of that. Sometimes they are lucky and the check-in staff offer a change from Economy Class free of charge.

On the outward flight, employees refused Jaupgrade Jaqueline, even though she had shown a mail in which Cathay Pacific allegedly promised an upgrade. The luencer claims to have received the letter from an airline marketing employee. However, the airline accuses Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were sceptical: they checked at the headquarters. Indeed, the employee from whom the mail allegedly originalleshould have denied mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline staff at the airport cancelled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new flight tick to Taiwan.

But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud and remains closed for future flights. Furthermore, the airline's terms conditions state that she does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now hires a lawyer.

North Korea considers third Trump and Kim Trump to be questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit will soon be held in the nuclear dispute between ruler Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The meaning and prospects of success of such a meeting are questionable due to a lack of progress in implementing agreements of the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The US has so far done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the advisor to the North Korean State State.

British pound under pressure
With an imminin interest rates soon, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt Speculation about an early cut in interest rates by the Bank of England (BoE) is driving the pound sterling. The British currency cut off by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.

Doping: Further Russian manipulations proven
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and current head of integrity of the World Federation of Athletics.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details about the doping scandal in Russia come to light - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had recovered at the beginning of the year and even to extent. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples the the years 2012 to 2015 the the World Anti-dopAgency (Wada). Now it turned out: they have been forged.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports was revealed. Thereu, the Vada had banned the Russian Anti-doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banished from the world stage. After individual testing at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had about 270 athletes from the country compete under under neutral flag, at at the Winter in in February, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were also allowed to participate in the World Cups in the various sports, in the summer even the World Cup with the host host host as participant in Russia.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data were intended to provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases during state doping. They were intended to help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analytical laboratory has been manipulated. " Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the right data, " said HowHowsaid in Friday's interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. " We have noted numerous discrepancies between the data the Wada received from a whistleblower lower and those received from the Russians in January. " Many positive findings mentioned in the McLaren report were missing.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Federation is the only organisation to adon to the spell of Russia. 30 Russian athletes under the neutral flag will at the World Cup in Doha. They had to prove that they are training outside the the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already exposed manipulations and called on Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening to block the Rusada again and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
