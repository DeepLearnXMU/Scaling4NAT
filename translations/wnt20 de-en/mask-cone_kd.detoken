Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered to be particularly dangerous has been extinguished, as the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out on the night of Thursday. Nobody was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in ed with around 200 fire engines.
The fire stopped
Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, and schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. Adtives for lubricants are produced in the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which stipulates particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work at the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when the gas methanthiol escaped through a leak in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, after an industrial accident, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
Wife quits her job to look for 57 days for her missing bitch
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and quit her job. Seven-year-old Border Collie had run out of the hotel room during a short holiday in Montana. 57 days was no trace of the bitch - but Carole King did not give up.
" It was terrible. I got sick, " Carole King told " Daily Inter Lake. " She and her husband had left bitch Katie in the hotel room while they went for dinner. Afterwards, when they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They searchlooking for the animal, but to no avail.
Thunder panicked dog
Hoping that Katie could stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. " The cleremployee says, " She left about four or four and a half hours ago, " Carole King recalls to " Daily Inter Lake. " When the automatic front door opened, Katie ran out immediately. Presumably, a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But days turned into weeks. " I never gave up. I never lost hope, " Carole King told Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal clerk to continue her search for Katie.
" The tears flowed "
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a call call: man man forward and said that Katie was in his yard. However, when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch was standing under a tree. " I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go, " King recalled loudly, " Daily Inter Lake. " " " The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out, and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her. "
Losses at Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday September 27th, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the whereabouts are unclear. The opposition speaks of a " frightening " scale.
Weapons and ammunition keep disappearing in the Bundeswehr - many of them have so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is evident to a list of classified classified information by the Federal Ministry of Defence and is reported by the editorial network Germany.
According to the paper from the office of Defense State Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon section and 3474 rounds of ammunition have reappeared so far. The still disappeared weapons and weapon parts are among others others six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven G3 rifles, four G36 rifles, six signal pistols and two pistols of the type P8. In addition, 30 weapon tubes for machine guns of the type MG3 are missing.
The extent of weapons and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr was " frightening, " said the left-wing BunMP Martina Renner. This was all the more true because hardly anything had been found in the course of investigations. The left politician spoke of a " poor balance. " Renner criticized that it was not clear in the list whether there was also the one among the missing ammunition that had been found in connection with the investigation against the Bundeswehr officer Franco A., who was suspected of terrorism. " And this even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted for possessing this ammunition, " said Renner.
Oil tanker " Stena Impero " left Iranian port
More than two months after its arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas today, Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker started moving and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates was indicated as the destination port.
The tanker had actually already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but at first it remained in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that they wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
The " Stena Impero " had been raised on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on charges of having violated security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was reacting to the controversial, temporary arrest of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which belonged to Great Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of global oil exports is shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping was drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There were several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to people's courage in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets during the Peaceful Revolution 30 years ago. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens shook the former GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony held by the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. Among other things, the Chancellor recalled the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. " The State Security was taken away from horror, " she said.
Musk aims for delivery record
Tesla's quarter may hold a record. Despite the delivery boom, there have been recent losses at the electric car company.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electrical car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures. " We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, " Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek. "
The demand is strong, so that Tesla can register 110,000 orders, Musk's circular continued. The challenge is to bring the cars to customers quickly. Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares left trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not risen that strongly for almost four months. Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. To do this, six-digit figures are needed in the current and next quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
Mystery solved: That's why we cannot tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from being able to tickle themselves. Scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments on rats, as they said on Thursday evening. Progress had also been made on the question of why children defend themselves so fiercely against tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also become shown why the approach of a tickling hand alone triggers laughter before the touch. This is due to a deep layer in the cerebrum, which triggers laughter even in the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, earlier research has shown that rats react with " laughter " in the ultrasound range when they are tickled by humans. This " laughter " is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch
Until now, it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-contact and touch by others - that is, why humans cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers have now found out in the experiments on the rats that laughter as well as the activity of the respective area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during self-contact. This was also the case when living beings clean themselves. However, during the foreign contact and the tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh had been intensified.
However, if self-contact and contact by others happen at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between self-contact and contact by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because self-touch activates a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Accordingly, they sometimes broke off this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showed flight behavior or rigidity of terror. This ambivalence resemto the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling was a behavioural reaction that was the same in rats and humans.
Catastrophe averted: major fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished, as Normandy prefecture told the AFP news agency on Friday, The fire broke out on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances have leaked. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. Nobody was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was deployed with around 200 fire engines.
Schools and kindergartens
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session in parliament after the lifting of the forced pause on Wednesday evening. The prime minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU on 31 October without an agreement if Brussels does not engage in its demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, it is unclear how he wants to achieve this.
Regarding Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: " The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and reunite that country would be to leave the EU. " Cox was assassinated by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Memorial to Oslo and Utöya attacks unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honour of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. Jernrosene " monument consists of around 1,000 iron replicas. They commemorate the roses had rowed by thousands of people in the days and weeks following the the attacks in front of Oslo Cathedral.
The project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be unveiled at the same place - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit, among others, are expected to attend the opening.
On 22 July 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik detonated a car bomb in Oslo government district of Oslo and subsequently shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organisation of the Social Democratic Workers' Party on the island of Utöya. A total of 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. British oil tanker " Stena Impero, " held in Iran, was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero, " which has detained in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After approval by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The " Stena Impero " has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now heading to Dubai for medical examinations, explained shipping company manager Erik Hånell. Around noon the ship left Iranian waters. " Nice that it's over, " he told the Swedish TV station SVT.
The State Department in London described the arrest of the ship as illegal. " This is part of a pattern of attempts to interfere the freedom of the oceans. We are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law, " said a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on 19 July on charges of having violated the law of sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. Hånell said that the remaining 16 crew members were doing well in accordance with the circumstances. In view of the difficult and exhausting situation, they had behaved professionally over the past ten weeks. Now, the shipping company is now working to reunthem with their families as quickly as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British of Gibraltar behind fixof the " Stena Impero, " at the beginning of July a super tanker with oil from Iran, which is said to have been destined for Syria, was chained there. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of " piracy " and threatened consequences. In mid-August, the " Adrian Darya-1 " was finally released. London vehemently rejected assumpptions that it was a barter to free the " Stena Impero. "
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports is shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping was drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There were several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US un@-@ dedly withdrew from the international nuclear agreement, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to ena stricter agreement agreement that is extended to other areas. Iran has so far resisted the pressure.
Because of the dispute over the " Stena Impero " and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative " Coalition of Hope " for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protective powers, wants to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India's protectionist economic policy offers a better future.
India would actually be predestined to be a " war profiteer. Given the punitive tariffs that America's President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to replan. Financial executives of Asian firms considering moving their production from China to another country cite India as one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. But this has not only due with the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have been created to play a more significant role in the globally diversified production chain.
But now India itself has come into Trump's focus. Derogatory dubbed as " White House tariffs " by the White White House, America withdrew the emerging market of trade benefits for 2000 products in early June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and demanding better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, however, the friction with India is merely a sideshow. Moreover, America also views the world's largest democracy through security-policy glasses. Delhi and Washington are linked by concern about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a volley of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just begun a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh himself to safety.
The problem, however, lies in a different place: the empirically substantiated thesis that open markets accelerate economic development is being difficult in the socialist Republic of India. Even under Modi. Its eagerness for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies are now receiving building permits for buildings faster. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more effective insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for liquidating seemingly dead companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic perspective, much has changed for the better in India in the first five years of the modes. However, this does not apply to trade policy. Inspired to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign providers, the national conservative government even erected new barriers.
In the West, Modi cling to the nimbus of the vigorous reformer, who radically renews his country economically, not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. In essence, however, the " India First " advocate never moved away from protectionist economic policies, preventing Indian firms from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the isolation of their industries are among the regular voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.
Jacques Chirac funeral on Monday in Paris

The competitor to the finish line: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The top of the world was already at the finish, when heart-warming scenes took place in the cooled down Khalifa International Stadium. Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to sway dangerously in the first preliminaries of the men over 5000 meters. He could hardly hold on his feet a good 300 meters from the finish, ran in an unhealthy stooped posture when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African Guinea-Bissau suddenly hooked him and dragged him supporting the last half round of the stadium to the stadium to the finish. However, both forces were still enough to stop the accompanying wristwatch after the finish. As if the scene had not been curious enough.
" I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same, " said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he attracted the attention of the assembled journalists completely unexpectedly. He shdged he he dofirst, didn't want to talk about his heroic deed at. After all, he wanted to set his personal best and when he realized that this would be difficult, he just wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which had been invited to the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn't even have allowed to start. " That's why I'm proud to run here for my country, " he said.
He did this that evening with emphatically - and much more intensively than he would have imagined, Because this heroic deed will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even left his competitor Busby the lead at the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, it was of no use, because Busby, who only came to the finish with a lot of help, was disqualified by the World Light Athletics Federation at the end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, took eted to set a personal best at the World Championships in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18: 10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: " I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. I've been under 18 minutes before. " However, only in training, best times don not count.
Millions mash: Egyptians gearing for wild protest day
In Egypt, the security measures were stepped up in the run-up to possible protests critical of the government. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, and streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, the police had already stepped up their road controls and partially searched pedestrians' mobile phones for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponents of Al Sisi
Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants, directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic accuses corruption and mismanagement. There had not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. Egyptian contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who lives in exile in Spain, who set up the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a " million march " in central places in the country today, Friday. Ali calls for a " people's revolution. " " For most young Egyptians, the man is not Egyptians, because he raked millions as a subcontractor for the army, but his messages are coming.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise according to two groups of observers. By Friday, the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures could not be confirmed independently at first. Nor, the government did not confirm and comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were " arbitrarily arrested " " just because they were' in the wrong place at the wrong time', " told HRW, citing lawyers who those arrested. According to their lawyers, charges against the detainees range from " dissemination of false information " to membership in a " terrorist association. " In Cairo, Alexandria, and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW, arbitrarily questioned and searched passers-by.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: mail order companies should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although companies could not be exempted from the VAT on donations in kind, the ministry explained in response to a question from the Green parliamentary group, which the newspapers of the Funke Media Group reported on on Friday. However, the dealers could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay little or no VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens send back every sixth parcel when orders on the Internet. Subsequently, around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - ended up in the waste. According to the current legal situation, donating them would cost companies additional money, because the tax authorities evaluate donations in kind such as a turnover that which then incto VAT.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies can evaluate products that cannot be sold accordingly and donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies must be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This applies not only to online trade, but also to other shops ranging from fashion shops to the hardware store.
Banksy auction art: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of street art star Banksy, " Devolved Parliament, " is to be auctioned off soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underscores " the regression of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the attitude of animals and tribes. " Starting on Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the south-west of the UK, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist exhibited the painting again, coinciding with the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work, formerly called " Question Time, " was renamed " Devolved Parliament. "
The image could change hands for millions.
Most recently, at the first session of the House of Commons on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had a hard exchange of opposition after the repeal a forced break imposed by Johnson had a hard exchange of blows with the opposition. Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit, which had already been postponed twice, on October 31, even without an agreement with the EU.
This is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture of a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. Thousands of truck drivers and other visitors see the plant entering the UK every day.
Brexit debate is like a " walk in the park "
According to his top adviser, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's violent verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a " walk in the park, " Dominic Cummings said at a book presentation on Friday. " We enjoy that. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win. "
Johnson had harshly attacked opponents of Brexit in parliament in recent days, accusing them, among other things, " betrayal " the people. He dismissed accusations that he could put MPs in danger because they could be the target of death threats, for example, as " humbug. "
Cummings said that the only way to calm down was for MPs to finally respect the British decision to leave the EU. Not surprisingly, people were upset that Britain had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. " We should talk to each other with respect, " a statement said. " And we should also listen. "
Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict during his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN general debate in New York. " If things go badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst. " The United Nations has a responsibility for Kashmir. " You should have prevented that. "
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate one part of Kashmir, another belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn the Indian Kashmir region of its autonomy status and thus abruptly increased the tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the fall of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is reacting harshsh against the current protests in Egypt. It is shooting at the population with live ammunition, more than 2000 detainees join the 60,000 political prisoners who are already held there in the prisons. Protesting has never been harmless in Egypt. However, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything to avoid a scenario like in the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one's own government drove millions onto the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get a grip on, no matter how hard it is against opponents.
Today, one in three in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the largest economic player. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already the case before el-Sisi. The Egyptian people have a lot of experience with authoritarian regimes, and the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It becomes critical whenever large parts of the population have difficulties to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER boss: No more " showstoppers " for capital airport
It was checked for two months whether the complicated system mesh works together with BER fire protection. Operators are satisfied with the progress. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there were still defects in the terminal to be dealt with. " We have many detailed topics, but we do not have a real showstopper. " He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The completion notice is now to be submitted to the building authority in the course of the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of shortcomings in power cables still need to be remedied; the Tüv will examine them by February. " In order to create the conditions for commencement of flight operations, intensive work must continue to deal with the shortcomings, " said a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no approval for all the dowels on which the cable lines hang. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time, it is about smoke aprons, which shut down like a canvas in a fire so that the smoke does not spread. They go down too far. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then, at the beginning of the year, there will be new experiments with hot gas smoke.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. It was originally scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Since construction began in 2006, costs have risen from two billion euros to around 6.5 billion euros at the opening next year.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. This is what a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October will about, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Chief Human Resources Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put airport finances on a firm footing.
Chemnitz: Vending machines blown up for drugs - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and blew up several vending machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in prison!
In the past two years, the number of blown-up cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region had risen sharply, causing millions in damage!
After two detonations at the end of May on Bu ¼ rgerstraße and Further Straße in Chemnitz, the police seized a 33-year-old German.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: " In the course of the investigations into the cause of explosive explosions in crime unit with a particularly serious case of theft, which were carried out by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-yes man was confirmed. "
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer has now confessed a total of eight deeds.
The police spokesman: " With the boot he apparently financed his beta exercise dependence. " The bomber had blown up parking ticket machines on Bu Wurgerstraße four times between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60 000 euros!
The vending machine bomber is now in custody. Police investigations against him continue.
It was conceivable that he was also responsible for further vending machine blasts in Chemnitz and adjacent counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is changing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over " the commercial management of all Eurowings flights from Vienna, " a Austrian Airlines spokesman confirmed to APA on Friday. " AviationNetOnline " had previously reported on this.
The Viennese base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will thus be de facto dissolved. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. From January 2020 will take over the AUA in the " etlease, " i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which are to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Route from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesperson explained. The flight times are to be coordinated with connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a " production company " for its company sister AUA. Barcelona and Rome, for example, would be served with AUA flight numbers, but primarily primarily with Eurowings equipment. Although the on-board product was to be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, Eurowings flights departing under AUA flight number will no longer be handled in Terminal 1, but, just like the AUA in Terminal 3.
After the Niki bankruptcy, a price war broke out at Vienna Airport. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced only on Thursday that it fleet would increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airline is sending four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called " Wetlease, " which the union criticized as a circumvention of the collective agreement.
The announcement by Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, AUA CEO Andreas Otto replied on Friday: " We will remain the number one at the site in five, six or ten years. "
Queen granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were best friends. Now the last of the four marmarried. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British royals: during the holidays in Italy at the beginning of the month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have asked for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31), as the palace announced on Thursday.
" We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so excited to start this adventure together and can't wait to actually be married, " the couple, who has been together since October 2018, according to British media reports, said in the official announcement.
" We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years, full of love and happiness. "
Sister Eugenie took pictures
Her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), took the official engagement photos and published them on her Instagram account.
Ein royales Fest
The wedding is scheduled for 2020. More information about the date, the place and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession to the throne and the real estate mogul will be a similarly great celebration as the wedding of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, an unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart failure or an infarction? Researchers in Hamburg now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
By analysing the genetic ome of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Hospital Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davos High Mountain Clinic, which is owned by the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and an unhealthy diet are among the main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases that can be influenced. Genetic factors help determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known, it was said. Now, the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Cardiovascular Centre at the UKE.
According to the hospital, possible disease causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - are currently known in more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes. Approximately 200 are added every year.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. According to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Cardiovascular Center, the data could also be used for research into other common diseases. New findings into the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there was a firm will to use the data for research into other diseases. So far, the Foundation's clinic in Davos has primarily treated allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be established on the local medical campus and a professorfor for bioinformatics is created. To justify his commitment, the Swiss-based logistics entrepreneur said that he had been open-heart operated in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the " Hamburg City Health Study. " According to the hospital, this is the largest local health study in the world with 45,000 test persons. The scientists assured that the genetic deccoding of genetic genetic genetic is strictly paid to the protection of anonymised data. It is one petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to the UKE, the genetic material of a human being can be decoded within 24 hours. The pure material costs for this would be 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is to begin on 1 October, and all 9,000 samples are to be analysed by the end of 2020. Initial results are expected in the following year.
Nigerian police rescue abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koranic school. According to information from local residents, security forces searched the school in the Northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were still underage, according to police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. " The victims were mistreated. some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers, " Sabo said.
The boys were detained under the pretext of being taught and " improved " in the Qur'an. In fact, the protégés were held by their teachers under " the most degrading and inhumane conditions, " Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran school has existed for about ten years. Residents had drawn the attention of the authorities of repeated irregularities in the facility. Sabo said that the parents were shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. According to the police, the operator and six employees were arrested.
There are many private Koranic schools in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled the border to the neighbouring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police freed 400 children from school
Police have freed nearly 400 students from appalling backgrounds in a school in northern Nigeria. " Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture, " said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after a hint in an Islamic school. The conditions there were " inhumane. " Officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all of them boys, had been held like slaves at their school and put on chains. Some were sexually abused. Television images showed emaciated and injured students in a noticeably poor health.
World football election: Further accusations after Messis and Klopp's freestyle
Soccer " Signature not valid "
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Association honouring the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. Lionel Messi, it is the sixth award and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations come to FIFA from other countries. Egypt was not evaluated at all - on a curious reason.
Much of FIFA has proven to be disreputable in recent years: the awards of the World Cup, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Football baller election has not yet been suspicion of being unclean - apart from the fact that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote according to sympathy rather on objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting overview.
FIFA apologizes that " the signatures on the election forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid. " The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan's coach also surprised
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was ultimately assessed: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in second and Sadio Mané in third. According to Fifa, however, the vote was the same received, with signatures and official stamps of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera also raised accusations: " Did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All about my vote is wrong, thank you, " he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
On Friday, the federation reported the message: Right, but of course it was no intention. The completed election documents were " erroneously " provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, according to a statement from the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas actually voted. " We are taking responsibility for the administrative error, " said the statement. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, " just as it says in the official list of FIFA. "
FIFA is now having the other cases examined in an investigation, but stresses that the election was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long, Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans call for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly spoken out for an official investigation into US President and party colleague Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, " said Vermont Republican Governor Phil Scott. " Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being established. " He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment process can lead to the dismissal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been observing Biden " for years. "
The Republicans have so far refrained from criticising Trump for the whistleblower affair, with few have shown unease about it. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party, with the moderate governor of Virginia having already opposed Trump's policies on several occasions, including the easing of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Another high-ranking Republican, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker spoke out for the investigation. " It's a deeply disturbing situation, " Baker said. " The right course of action and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it. "
As governor of US states, Scott and Baker have no formal say in the case against Trump, which will being decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, first Republican senators have also been critical of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the Second Chamber of Representatives, said that the case was " extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing. " US media also report that the first internal cracks are opening up among Republicans.
The affair could result in the opening of impeachment proceedings against Trump, House Democrats have announced an investigation, accusing him of abusing power for the purpose of foreign interference for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could make a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have a majority. Thus, the prospects of success in such a process are slim. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board Rackete's " Sea Watch "?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, who allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had illegally headed for the port of Lampedusa the rescue ship " Sea Watch 3 " and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also from Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted by an Italian judge after a few days.
Now new serious accusations are being made against rackets. Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have arrived in Italy with the " Sea-Watch 3. " The suspects have been caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. " We cannot rule this out, but we do no have information information ourselves, " " Sea Watch " spokesman Ruben Neugebauer told the German Press Agency.
The police reported in-police reported that the suspects had raped, tortured and even murdered in the North African country. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians, Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). " The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - by repeated and constant physical violence, " the statement said at the time.
NGOs and aid organisations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is board the ships. " We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports, " said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. " It is therefore very important that this is investigated. "
Italy's right-wing ex-interior minister Matteo Salvini immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
Musk Tesla delivery record
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures.
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, " Musk wrote in an e e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog " Electrek. "
The demand is strong, so that Tesla can register 110,000 orders, Musk's circular continued. The challenge is to bring the cars to the customers quickly. Tesla had to provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares left trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not risen that strongly in almost four months. Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures are needed in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
US budget dispute: Another bridge financing
The new fiscal year in the US will begin on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and approved transitional financing until November 21.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending plans before the new fiscal year beginning on October 1. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and passed a continuing resolution (CR) until November 21. Without such a decision, there would have been a shutdown at midnight on Monday, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump has yet to put the decision into force.
Shutdown
For the time being, the federal administration will now being financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the fiscal year 2019, which ends on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws that allocate funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore for the time being, the federal administration cannot benefit from the extended expenditure framework from 1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion for the new financial year.
The Democrats have passed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have a majority. However, spending laws reflect the priorities of Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has more or less willing ten of the twelve spending plans, which are barely capable a majority.
The ghosts differ mainly on the issue of resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the Wall, one of President Trump's major priorities. The Democrats are disturbed by the Wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the construction of the wall, the ghosts depart
It is currently unclear how the parties will come closer on this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve laws over the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November. Even a shutdown is not ruled out.
Against the backdrop of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Submission p. 1877 on the avoidance of shutdowns, the financing of the federal administration would automatically continue at the previous year's level, prevent the travel activities of parliamentarians and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination will also be open to women and lesbians living alone in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to benefit from in vitro insemination ination, thus likely to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics on the right-wing camp had warned that numerous " children without a father " could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an " opportunity " for society. It reflects the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the costs of artificial insemination for all women should be borne by social security.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband
By a narrow majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that was to give widows access to sperm of their dead husband for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination " is permitted " post-mortem. " In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women complained in vain about the surrender of the sperm of a deceased person. Opponents of the incident in Paris argued that such a child conceived thered such way then bear a " particularly difficult fate. "
Numerous deputies of the ruling La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) led by President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had spoken out in favour of artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be imposed on a " double grief " if the death of her husband also left her desire to have children unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow should in future be able to be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
Until far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain banned.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: Calls for a flight levy for universities are getting louder
There is a lot of flights at the universities, which is why the state wants to have a climate levy paid there as well in the future. Rectors say they have no money for it. However, now they are also coming under internal pressure.
Universities should also limit flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion on a climate levy on flights from universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is gaining momentum again. After the State Rectors' Conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding advance from the Green-Black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral students of six universities in Baden-Württemberg and a pedagogical university call for compensation for business flights. This is " urgently necessary, " as a first step, and at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, it says in their statement. The cabinet decision, originally planned in July, is still on hold, because the CDU has still not approved the submission of the Greens.
Russia once again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the secret service FSB, the detainees had fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had already been arrested. At that time, there was an exchange of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. North Korean fishermen were therefore in Russian territorial waters, where Russia Russian Coast Guard claims to patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squid
During the renewed checks, 30,000 squid were discovered and confiscated on the boats. According to the information, three fishing and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Nakodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's fisheries authority did not issue fishing licenses to North Koreans this year even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily arrested there this year, according to the media.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern Region of Primorsky, Georgi Martynov, recently complained of high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also take small organisms from the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose.
Only 18,000 in the future: US lowers asylum ceiling
The " most generous nation in history ": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police in the White House.
The richest country in the world is closing itself off to those seeking protection: as the State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal immigration of refugees will be further lowered. In the future, threatened believers and Iraqis in particular are to be granted asylum.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees again. In the 2020 financial 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the US State Department explained. In the now almost expired financial year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
In recent years, President Donald Trump's administration has drastically reduced the willingness to accept people seeking protection from around the world, with much higher reception limits being applied under Barack Obama's previous administration.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was launched in 1980. Nevertheless, the State Department described the US as " the most compassionate and generous nation in history, " a phrase that strongly recalls the incumbent US president's language.
A " responsible approach " of refugees aims to enable the refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild, Trump explained. He receives a lot of support from supporters for his hard line in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to close. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a time link between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Zelensky affair and a possible impending impeachment procedure.
According to the State Office, the US government wants to focus in the future on receiving two groups of refugees: people who are being persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, according to the statement of the State Department. on the other hand, a maximum of 1,500 refugees are to be accepted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The US wants people from this " northern triangle " of Central America in particular to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this backdrop, the United States has first concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras, in order to curb immigration on the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
At the request of the Argentine judiciary, a female orangutan has been transferred from the former zoo of Buenos Aires to a reception centre for apes in the USA. Born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986, " Sandra " was granted the rights of a " non-human person, " so her release was mandatory. On Thursday evening, the animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday evening - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human monkey is unable to adapt to life in the wild, she is to live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There, 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees are already housed there, among them " Bubbles, " formerly a pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, " Sandra " has to go through a 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, " Sandra " spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The trial of " Sandra's " fundamental rights, which was initiated by animal rights activists, has contributed to the transformation of Buenos Aires zoo into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and educational facility for the preservation of biodiversity is to be built there.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussar ride on the almost 3000-metre-high Großer Pinnacle in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double floor or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550-metre-high north face of the Great Pinnacle in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, a T-shirt and only supported by absolute vertigo, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus, he beat the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder in free solo speed on four of the six most important European north faces.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sporting goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profits. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars (just under 1.3 billion euros) in the quarter under review, which is 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. The main reason for this is the new " Nike Direct " marketing, " with which the Adidas competitor is addressing its customers online.
Sales rose to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period to the end of August. Nike sales figures the strongest growth, an increase of 22 percent in China. Thus, the group from Beaverton in the US state of Oregon, also benefited from its approach of targeting directly via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People's Republic of China.
CFO Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue to drive the " digital transformation " of the sporting goods manufacturer with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors reacted happily to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer rose by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban for racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about professional football player Juan Jesus from AS Rom, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. Jesus, a defender Jesus from Brazil, was insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. " @ officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. # NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am, " wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing for AS Rom since 2016.
The club reacted late Thursday. He had reported the fan's account on Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporter is never allowed to attend a match of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. " We cannot have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation hasn't improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums, " FIFA President Gianni Infantino had said at the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist songs in the first-division match between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florenz last Sunday.
But there had also been discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rioting fans of record champion Juventus Turin Turin, the police said. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years years. Accordingly, the rest are bans of four to seven years.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra fan groups in the vicinity of Juventus. The twelve are accused, among other things, severe extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club set the investigation in motion with a complaint last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders are behind the black trade in tickets, They " militarily controlled " the ticket trade for the fan curve and allegedly blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - entire vintages are given catchy designations. If you take a closer look, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective attitude to life of young people?
" The crabs are coming! " With this call, crab fishing officially started at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun on September 21st, heralding the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern spur of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international " Slow City " in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international " Slow City " movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of " 30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields. " The magnificent natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun started growing crab breeding in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that has generated high incomes and became an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has actively sought large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding, as well as technology-based crab breeding, and the city has taken care of promoting greater efficiency in agriculture and farmers' incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to " distribute power, optimize administration, and government services " and has carefully built the service network for " permits under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network for services, a platform for lending, " order to comprehensively optimize the environment for approvals, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local advantages by connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, and uses the development zone and its position as an international " slow city " as a figurehead to establish intelligent high-end production facilities, biomedical and medical technology companies, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sector, as well as companies for organic agriculture, which are leaders in the " 3 + 2 " area. At the same time, Gaochun has also promoted the establishment of a national tourism zone and all areas and tourist destinations of national importance, by integrating the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun Gaochun landscape, the condition of the buildings for civil services and for the public service, the areas of " Tourism + " and " " + Tourism " has been vigorously developed the development of cultural tourism at a high level of quality. It is worthwhile to look forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and US: Ruhani speaks of ending sanctions - Trump contradicts
On his return from the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions. The United States had promised an end to all sanctions in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted his Iranian counterpart via Twitter: " Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on it so that there is a meeting. I said, of course, no. "
Ruhani describes it as follows: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and urged that a meeting take place. " And America says I am lifting the sanctions, " Ruhani added. The kind of punitive measures that should be ended was discussed. " And they clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions. "
However, this move did not take place in an acceptable way, criticized Ruhani. In view of the punitive measures and " the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure, " no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York, The Europeans " hope to save the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated with Russia and China, which will prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. Like Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of a catastrophe is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, the Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. On Thursday, the earthquake with a magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions. Oktay announced that the government now wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - among other things, by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which were registered as refuges in the center, have long since been in up. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August, the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of Thursday's quake was in the Sea of Marmara in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometres, according to the civil protection authority Afad. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that no injuries or damage had been reported at first. TRT state broadcaster showed people running out of their homes in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some students cried, as could be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly prone to earthquakes. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the AnatoliEarth plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. During the earthquake on Thursday, it hit the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies are drafting emergency plans, private individuals have packed so-called go-bags with everything they need standing next to front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wobbles. When the next big quake will come is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people had been injured and some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom), according to which two minarets of mosques collapsed in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Aftershocks warning in Istanbul
Buildings shook. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official data, the date of the quake is given as 1: 59 (local time). According to CNN Turkey, only a few minutes after the first earthquake, there was an aftershock with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday, an earthquake with a magnitude of 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt as far as Istanbul. Its epicenter was also in the Sea of Marmara west of the metropolis of millions, the civil protection authority Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a forewarning. This has made it more likely, he told CNN Türk. " These could be the signs of a major earthquake, " Ersoy told the transmitter. " Sooner or later, the big quake will also come. "
There had already been an incident a few weeks ago - the earthquake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania, there had also been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 people injured. The earth had also shaken at Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents are a new fuel in the Ukraine affair over the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment procedure, the US Democrats are encouraged: the complaint submitted by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump, and his controversial telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president contains important evidence for investigations against the president. Trump himself once again sees himself as a victim of a " witch-hunt. " He also questioned the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - plane diverted
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight was diverted by United Airlines. According to the US media, the toilet door had been blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco.
During an unscheduled stopover in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time), the woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin. US media wrote that she had been locked up in it for about an hour, citing other passengers. Passengers had to change aircraft for the onward flight towards San Francisco.
In a video distributed on the Internet, which according to US media is said to be from Flight 1554, we can see how several people are trying to free the woman. " We are currently working on opening the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay? " says a man in it. The airline had apologized to all passengers. First, it was unclear whether the woman would receive compensation.
The Cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story " Die Rheinlung " the British author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit chaos in Great Britain.
The novel " The Cockroach " will be published in German on 27 November, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named " Jim Sams, " who was ignored or hated in his previous life but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Great Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into practice and is wildly determined to be stopped by anything and anyone.
McEwan was quoted as saying: " When parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers shamelessly lie like the Soviet leaders once did, when Brexiteers in high positions implore the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to this: write. " McEwan's novel " Machines Like Me " about artificial intelligence was only published in the spring.
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself " transformed into a tremendous vermin, " is gradually excluded from family and society, and finally perishes. " Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands upside down, " said Diogenes publishing house.

Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31st
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all trips up to and including 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travel could not be started for insolvency law reasons, " the company announced on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid for or are paid in full. The company left open what it stands to travel with a start from 1 November 2019. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it was said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday hotels abroad, which currently still host Thomas Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels will be conditional that holidaymakers are no longer asked to make extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman for the German Press Agency said. " This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travellers are not requested or otherwise forced to pay hotel bills individually by these hotels, " spokesman Bernd Engelien continued.
The insurance company reacted to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own statements, had been forced to pay for their own accommodations on site. Accordingly, some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had criticized this sharply.
How many hotels are affected will be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance spokesman. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers from Germany were still on the road. Zurich Germany has secured the holiday and return journey of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the payouts to hotels now announced by Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are currently still on the road. Things look bad for Thomas Cook customers who still want to fly on holiday. Late on Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips up to and including 31 October would be cancelled. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
The company left open what the situation to travel starting on 1 November 2019. In coordination with the insolvency insurance the further procedure is examined, it was said. In principle, the Zurich insurance company is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips has been stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of reimbursing the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys mine in Angola
Prince Harry has been continuing the engagement of Lady Diana for a long time. In Africa, he is now following directly in the footsteps of his mother.
Clothed in a blue splinter vest, the British Prince Harry has detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Dirico, he made the ignition circle in front of TV cameras on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to follow directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same explosive master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to travel the path she went at that time. The pictures in which Princess Diana walked through a cleared minefield in 1997, had gone around the world. She, too, had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a clear: there will certainly not be a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations with him. But what statements are everlasting for the polarizing Briton. The recent ruling of the UK Supreme Court hovers like a sword of DamDamocles over the blonde. His suspension of parliament in order to be able to stubbornly carry out its Brexit course until the exit date was annulled earlier this week. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to effect an extension of the bilateral talks until October 31 in the event of failed negotiations with the EU. However, Johnson had categorically ruled this out.
Boris Johnson still possible
But the pressure does not seem to be noticeable by Johnson either. Meanwhile, when he visited a hospital, he hinted that if an disagreement, he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we will abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best of all with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that it will work out.
And time is gradually running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. Again, the EU and the British negotiators have about six weeks to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. However, even the most recent talks have not achieved a breakthrough. An agreement until the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at the moment. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further postponement of the withdrawal date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Minister. It fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US authority: Further deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths in connection with the use of e-cigarettes in the USA has risen to twelve. Moreover, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, the US health authority CDC reported. According to a study in the " New England Journal of Medicine, " there were already more than 900 people affected, around 500 of them confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage is known so far. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the USA.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is Growing
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared millions in online networks. In them, the contractor and actor, who lives in Spain, calls for a " people's revolution. " Today, Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes to have mass rallies with one million participants in central places in the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence has already been observed. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in the past few days, the police had stepped up their street controls and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for news and photos in connection with the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly this. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them had been arbitrarily arrested - just because they were " in the wrong place at the wrong time, " HRW told those arrested, citing lawyers.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing the democratically elected Islamist President Mohamed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of government, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially convicted in recent years.
" Ocean Change ": Arved Fuchs from Greenland-Expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. Upon his arrival at the Port of Hamburg, he was greeted, among others, by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the racing yacht " Malizia. "
In recent months, Fuchs and a team of scientists investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship " Dagmar Aaen " on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar researcher. He had waited for years for the young generation to speak out. It has been known for decades that the Earth is warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
" What happens at sea often takes place in secret, " said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and ocean litter. Among other things, it was said during the expedition, Greenlandic glacier ice was measured with a drone and fished with nets for microplastics.
The polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the " Seadevcon Maritime Award " during the Hamburg Climate Week, " for his " fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans. " Arved Fuchs is a great role model. " For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, " said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. " He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades. "
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: that seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. Although the bill with 80 euros tip was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
" Such cases damage Rome's reputation. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud, " demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The Japanese women had ordered only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to be inferred from the bill. Also, a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, said the innkeeper.
A phone call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump may indeed be faced with impeachment proceedings after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, and the Democrats now want to examine this as soon as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives - we are talking about weeks before a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The accusation of the whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation to the public with his complaint out of concern for national security and US democracy, is monstrous: the president had abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country to influence the 2020 election. He had blackmailed exploited Ukraine's dependence and wanted to force it to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be seen in the transcript of the conversation with Zelensky, which has been published in now, although it does not reflect the full wording. However, the July 25 call is only one episode of a much larger story, at the center of which, besides Trump, is primarily his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public point of view, the story begins in May 2019, when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected President Zelensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. " We do not interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation into what we have the right to do, " he tells the newspaper. One might think it is inappropriate, but " nothing illegal about it. " Giuliani wants investigations to be prosecuted in Ukraine for which there is hardly any basis - " because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could prove to be helpful to my government. "
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to construct an occasion for the Russia investigation in the US. However, this accusation was never serious.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk about so prominently on the phone with Zelensky in July. Giuliani and the president's version reads that the former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy, Joe Biden, as the Obama administration's Ukraine representative, urged the dismissal of then-Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor tor okin, in order to stop the investigation he was responsible for of the gas company on whose board of directors his son Hunter Biden served. Biden senior had blackmailed Ukraine financially to cover up his family's corrupt machinations.
In fact, the procedure was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General leave, the investigation against the gas company was already completed, and Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt behavior, and the US government was by no means the only Western partner who pressed for his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Facebook and Whatsapp disruptions: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, Germany, Great Britain and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not loaded again and again since about 3.30 pm. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disruption, although not to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. often affected by disturbances
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And, as in the previous cases, users mainly use Twitter to vent their anger.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were traveling in a rubber dinghy and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - it took the Chilean rescue helicopter less than an hour to salvage.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of Chilean Air Brigade:
" At 9: 30 we received the news, shortly before ten we started, and a good 20 minutes later we were over the dinghy. "
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, where 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers have been safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NEVER wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come onto the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - above all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommendable.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against wireless charging charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat generation. If a mobile phone is charged normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. During wireless charging, however, have always measured above 30 degrees, even if the smartphone is perfectly aligned of alignsmartphone on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives up power consumption.
Capacity
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role here. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but also does not last so long overall. Thus, the service life is lower. Therefore, the researchers advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since battery replacement on modern smartphones is always associated with high high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the costs of a battery replacement even more - for all iPhones.

The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable clutter and laborious plug-dle. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) is a worldwide standard, in which even Apple participates, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest traffic photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal, setting a record, his expedition operator said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project " Mission Possible. " He has already made international headlines: He took a photo of climbers queuing on Mount Everest viral in the spring.
The image of the mass crowd triggered a debate about stronger safety measures on the 8848-meter-high mountain and highest peak on earth. In May, eleven climbers died during the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking Xixabangma Mountain in Tibet. The reason given for this is bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China in order to enable him to climb.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals there is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman on Friday. " We suspect that the elephant have been poisoned. "
The four carcasses were found in a sanctuary near the famous former rock fortress Sigiriya visited by many tourists. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. Often, the perpetrators are farmers on whose land the animals had previously kept harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants killed every year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants still live in Sri Lanka. Theoretically, their killing is punishable by death.
British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " is leaving the port of Bandar Abbas more than two months after his arrest by Iran. This was announced by the Bandar Abbas maritime authority, according to the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had established the British-flagged tanker on 19 July on charges of violating maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in criticism
The responsible economic committee of the House of Commons wants to investigate the bankrupttcy of travel travel giant Thomas Cook. It will include the board's salary packages, as well as the question of why the British government did not want to help financially in the company that struggling to survive. " We interest are interested in supervision in the company as well as control by external accountants, " said committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. " Apparently, we are dealing with a bad example of management greed. "
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of colorectal cancer
The role of genes in the familially increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. This is the conclusion of researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come in a recent study. Other risk factors, such as familial dietary habits therefore likely to weigh more heavily than previously assumed. The DKFZ scientists stress that this has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colorectal cancer.
Elon Musk Tesla shares
This is what Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog " Electrek. " Demand is strong, so that Tesla could register 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to bring the cars to customers quickly. Tesla must provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares left trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not risen that strongly in almost four months. Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus reached its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360' 000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures are needed in the current and next quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
Will British government circumvent Brexit law? Johnson cautious
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping secret about whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the most recent parliamentary law against an unregulated Brexit. In response to a question, he merely told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a " capitulation law " that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could attempt to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until after leaving the EU.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is with an agreement. "
Iran apparently uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased the pressure on the European treaty parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear " Unfortunately, the European states show incompetence or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions, " Rouhani said on Thursday said at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. If they did not stand by their promises, he held out the prospect of " further steps " away from the agreements of the labstakingly negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background to this conflict the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained commitment commitment Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the US withdrew from the agreement on its own in order to force Iran with " maximum pressure " change course in the Middle East policy, which is considered aggressive. President Donald Trump's administration wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions, and is now relying on harsh sanctions against Tehran again. Iran recently responded to this by restarting the uranium enrichment limited by the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now also using the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium or has at least prepared them for use. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not prepared to bear their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of burdensive US sanctions, Rouhani suspected. However, there will still be further talks that would hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the situation has changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: on Monday, Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Houthi rebels in Yemen who were supported by Iran, had claimed responsibility for the attack, but the US regarded the US as a false commitment. " We have nothing to do with, " Rouhani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
" Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this, " Rouhani said. However, the European leaders could not have done this in the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they had only reled that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the US administration's far-reaching sanctions must first be lifted, Rouhani demanded. He called on the administration in Washington to shift to a policy of " dialogue and reason. "
Comet crossed by another star
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This has been achieved before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named 2I / Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The widely travelled comet was discovered on 30 August by amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-made telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter. Follow-up observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not originate from our solar system.
After 1I /' Oumuamua in 2017, 2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object that has been sighted during a flight of our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to gain close-up insights into a foreign solar system before it disappears never. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by by the Canary Asthysihysical Institute. " The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which at this distance is well above the typical speeds rates of objects orbiting the Sun, " Davide Farnoccchia of the US space agency Nasreported in a statement.
According to the analyses, the comet is on a so-called hyperbola orbit, which takes it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, interstellar tail star, which was initially listed under catalogue number C / 2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I / Borisov, the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: in contrast to 1I /' Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been seen in the approach, leaving the researchers have many months to investigate. " The object will reach its highest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020, " explained Farnocchia. " Therethat, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020. "
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. A team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I /' Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object for 2 to 16 kilometers in a first study. Images from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. " The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that its composition must be similar, " reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar similar to those in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years indicates that these objects could open up a new way to investigate certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such visits. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept by a planned satellite mission by the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency intends to deploy the three-part spacecraft " Comet Interceptor " " at a waiting position 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it will either in wait for a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system or for an interstellar visitor such as 1I /' Oumuamua.
First Landing on Beijing's New Mega Airport Daxing
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, the time has come: a first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines has landed at the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honour for the captain and crew.
The new airport is expected to handle around 45 million passengers annually by 2022, compared to 72 million by 2025. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion project. China's most recent prestigious project is also called " starfish " because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 - and much smaller - has has been repeatedly postponed. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger aircraft landed after just four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: from London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - that's what the British space agency UK Space Agency is dreaming. This is to be made possible, which is targeted for the 20for 20202030s by a special propulsion (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) developing by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency. " This is the technology that could definitely accomplish this, " head of agency agency Graham Turnock told the station. " We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced. "
In order to push the project forward, the British Space agency wants to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to date, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until the closure of operations in 2003 and took three to three and a half hours to do so. In 2000, there was an accident during the launch of a Concorde at Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, in which all 109 occupants were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin, announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US space agency Nasa, the " X-Plane. " Virgin Galactic also has such developments in its program.
" Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport, " writes Reaction Engines on its homepage, among others. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times faster as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabling the " next generation of truly reusable framing equipment. "
Riot in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair over the possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
" I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information, " Trump told staff of the US embassy to the United Nations in New York on Thursday. The person concerned was almost " a spy " and in the past they dealt with " a bit differently " in the past than it is today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate tipiers. Actually, the event was not public. However, several US media outlets broadcast audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced preparations for impeachment against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who makes serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. Under great public pressure, the descriptions of the whistleblower were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received information from several government officials that the US president is " using the power of his office " to ensure that another country interferes in the 2020 US election in his favor.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden, about previous business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is leading the race for the Democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukraine phone call: leading government employees had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been drawn up. However, after the conversation, this had been removed from a normally intended database on the orders of lawyers from the White House and instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known, and the New York Times reported that he was an employee of the CIA.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called " whistleblower " had disseminated second-hand information that had turned out to inaccurate. Therefore, there may be no tipiers or spies at all.
However, how Trump spoke in New York about those who allegedly leaked information to the whistleblower sparked outrage. US House Chairman Nancy Pelosi reacted worryingly, complaining that Trump's statement once again undermined the government's integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his entourage have been underon in various committees for months. In view of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pushing ahead with investigations with new force in order to initiate a possible impeachment procedure against Trump.
" The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation, " said House Intelligence Committee head Adam Schiff. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of misrepresenting things, and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insulted Schiff and had demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US security and foreign policy officials, most of whom worked under Democratic, but also Republican presidents, backed the Democrats' investigation into a possible impeachment in a statement published on Friday. If the allegations came to be true, Trump would be " an unscrupulous abuse of power, " it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could initiate a so-called impeachment procedure, but the decision on an actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have a majority. Therefore, the prospects of success of such a process are slim. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
VW Works Council: Jobs " stealthily " cut
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023. Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved already this year.
One key to this is personnel costs. The " Future Pact " negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be cut at the carmaker if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security applies until 2029.
However, as our newspaper learned from works councillors, jobs in production, which are not actually up for disposal, are " stealththily " cut by another way - that is, past the official course. Thus, regular vacancies would often not be filled again.
In these cases, the works council had no possibility of forcing the reoccupment. Meanwhile, in many places is lack of lacking, the work of work is increasing, the worries about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would becoming greater. Thus, the fear is also growing that the vehicle production could be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favorable in other parts of the world. From VW was only said: " An adjustment of the employment volume is carried out in a socially acceptable manner along the demographic curve. "
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more worldwide and manage new projects centrally. This is also also intended to reduce costs and also accelerate decisions - behind this is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Chief Production Officer Andreas Tostmann, said at a manager conference in Berlin: " Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof. "
There have already been successes in this way: this year, for example, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle will fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on Wolfsburg 24 October, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. VW does not give exact figures on the production time, according to our newspaper, it is at the Golf 7 around
20
In our region, the main plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb at VW is that 800,000 cars have to be built there annually in order for the plant to be satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling diesel demand and the problems of switching to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas test procedure.
However, as Chief Production Officer Tostmann announced last year, one million cars are to roll off the production line in Wolfsburg " in the future. " This is to make it possible to bundle golf production at the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is giving over golf production by converting it to a location for e-car production.
In addition, the Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) SUVs are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations now rest on Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build e-mobility, it is to remain the bread-and-butter car of the Wolfsburgers for the time being.
Forced into prostitution with voodoo: traffickers sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been oowed, smuggled into the Ruhr and forced into prostitution. Six suspected traffickers have been sent to prison for this.
Six suspected traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday in Bochum to probation and prison sentences of up to eight years and three months. The defendants smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian women who wanted to leave the country still had to take a ritual oath at home in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean in inflatable boats with the help of Libyan smugglers. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. Once in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to deal with the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25,000 euros. Therefore, their wages were completely taken from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the smuggling and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothels in the trial. " The work made it difficult for women physically and psychologically, " said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. " Some were really disgusted. "
The sentences are to commercial and gang smuggling of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendance union Ufo has again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will " inform about the industrial action in the LH Group on 14 October, " announced Ufo collective bargaining director Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with UFO for months. This also includes the question of whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
Following a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court, Ufo now sees itself strengthened on this point. Lufthansa wanted to determine that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court dismissed the applications. The company confirmed the decision and considered to appeal against it. " I think it is unlikely that a second court sees the matter completely differently, " said UFO board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Frankfurt State Labour Court to have the status of the UFO as a trade union reviewed in court. The company argues that the union has not appointed a representative board for months and is therefore not in a position to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the trade union, in the course of which numerous members of the board as well as the advisory board resigned, including the long-time trade union leader Nicoley Baublies. Due to doubts about its leadership, the Ufo had suspended a vote that had already begun on strikes by the cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but that is now to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, it wants to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission announced.
" The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country, " said Ahmad Al-Khaatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult for tourists to access. Visas are usually only issued for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes for more income from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churai oil field. As a result, national oil production plummeted, and oil price bulumps. It is likely to take several weeks for the Kingdom's oil production to return to its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber preparing for wedding
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding. On Thursday (local time), the model posted several party photos in their Instagram Stories featuring her in a white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits, including banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: " Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding. " According to media reports, the celebrity couple want to get married in church next weekend.
A year ago, the Biebers said yes to each other in a New York registry office. There had not been a major party at that time.
In a recent interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: " If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship. "
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic. The police reported that the wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the town of Mecin (Metschin). The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been searching for the machine since Thursday evening, after the crew had given an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also used in the search. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of Europe's tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, reported the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in Brussels on Friday. It examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of endangerment and thus at the verge of extinction.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories: from " potentially endangered " to " endangered, " " endangered, " " endangered " and " extinct in nature " to " extinct. " In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
rowan and chestnut threatened
In Germany, rowans (Sorbus) are particularly threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, told the German Press Agency. " Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats. "
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They are regarded as " endangered " since 2017, level two on the IUCN scale. The biggest threat next to a fungus is the Balkan miner's moth. It has been spreading from Southeast Europe over the whole continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 specimens. The trees in cities, parks and avenues are not considered in this assessment.
Shrub species and mosses also in danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists compiled new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wild, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
" This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet, " said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. " We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority. "
Earthquake off Istanbul: 34 injured reported
The recent earthquake in Turkey injured 34 people. According to the information, there were no deaths. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. On Thursday, the magnitude 5.8 earthquake shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly earthquake-prone. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.
One of the most severe quakes was a magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, the epicenter was in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday, a 4.6 magnitude earthquake had shaken the region around Istanbul. Authorities called on the residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira on half-time show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American Football Final Super Bowl, as the singers announced on Twitter. " It won't get any bigger, " Shakira wrote about a photo of herself and Lopez. She was incredibly excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, Miami time will come in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996, when she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky on the half-time show. " Now it's even more special because the NFL lasts 100 years and I'm going to perform with another Latina. " She couldn't wait to " show what we girls can do on the world's biggest stage. "
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she was honored to stand alongside another artist on one of the largest stages in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. " And then on my birthday! " The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two " queens " were on stage stage.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining spectators
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you have recently dropped audience numbers: This February, the spectacle in the USA attracted the fewest viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost one hundred million people on average.
There had been turproil about the half-time show of the last Super Bowl in the run-up: According to media reports, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear in the dispute over dealing with quarterback Colin Kaepernick. After all, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had fallen on his knees in the 2016-17 season before NFL games at the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused a great stir, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African-American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been without a club since March 2017 and has no longer played an NFL game. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook bankruptcy: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook is likely to cost some banks dearly. There is a threat of high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected by this, writes the " Financial Times " in its Friday issue.
According to the report, banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse would probably have to write and amoration total of up to £1.8 billion (around EUR 2 billion) on their books, according to estimates by the consulting firm AlixPartners had shown.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept depreciation of £900 million to £1 billion and lenders between £550 and £825 million. The actual amounts to be written off are more likely to be at the upper end of the bandwidth, an expert told the paper.
How big the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end will be seen after the insolvency proceedings expired. A person close to this proceedings did not spread too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in Great Britain were " old " and many of the properties were in bad locations. The most money could probably be obtained with the sale of the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook, it continued.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
The Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who allegedly tortured and killed people in Libya. " We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any reliable information about it, " the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, told the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. " They come without passports. "
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June and rammed a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects allegedly arrived there. Investigations are the way for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
United States warns the federal government of Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great, " Pai told Handelsblatt with regard to setting up the new 5G mobile network.
China has a " national security law " that obliges every company " under Chinese jurisdiction " to follow instructions from the security organs.
Current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties of such requests, " continued the FCC CEO, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to demand a " declaration of trustthiness " from suppliers.
Berlin initially wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the " Handelsblatt, " citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, " said Pai.
It is " very hard to imagine " that a government agency, " no matter where, would be able to review every single update in real time to detect security risks, " the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The employee company that allegedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government, " Pai told Handelsblatt.
The US has insights that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the US position.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: Schools closed
At night, local residents hear explosions. A gigantic wall of fire illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleanup could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
As a precaution measure, the facilities in twelve municipalities would not open on Friday, the responsible prefecture announced. The Ministry of the Interior had called on the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to expose themselves to the smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. According to the prefecture on Twitter, there was still a risk that smell would spread after the extinguishing. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters as well as 90 police officers and gendarmes were deployed at the fire there.
A gigantic black column of smoke had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol company, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations, which are particularly monitored. In Seveso near Milan, Italy,, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that no " high toxicity " had been found in samples at first. However, pollution pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. Dams against pollution had been built in the river, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out in the early morning at around 2: 40 a.m., the authorities reported The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: " Germany must invest now "
French Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest, and now, the sooner the better, " said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for next year.
The eurozone economy is weak, the minister warned.
We must not wait for the economic situation to make the necessary decisions. "
Those states that have budgetary room for manoeuvre for more investment must act, Le Maire with regard to Germany, among other things.
France did not have these margins, the minister added, pointing to his country's high level of public debt, which amounts to more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. French public debt must be " stabilised " and " reduced, " said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly made appeals to Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax breaks of more than nine billion euros for households.
Among other things, the French government is reacting to the protests of the Yellow Vest movement. New debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he trying to trick?: Johnson avoids question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticises the " surrender law " passed by Parliament.
The parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could use another loophole. Asked about this possibility, the Tory politician evdges.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hidden about whether he wants to impose an unregulated Brexit - spite of the recent law passed by Parliament, which should prevent that. In response to that question, Johnson merely told journalists that his government would abide by current law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a " capitulation law " that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law. The Prime minister could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is with an agreement. "
Johnson's chief advisor, Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, declared that he saw the political disputes over Brexit as a " walk in the park " and was confident that the desired exit from the EU would still come about: " We enjoy it, we will win, we will (editor's note: leave the EU), don't worry, " Cummings said according to the British newspaper " Telegraph " at a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign " Vote Leave " during the election campaign prior to the 2016 EU referendum, is now the chief strategist in the British seat of government Downing Street. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that have led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book " The Polaroid Diaries " delves deeply into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the illustrated book " The Polaroid Diaries " in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Illustrious guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: " # ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse of the life of an extraordinary pre-Instagram family, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film. "
Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found her way for photography, was always with her. She has made thousands of Polaroids, several hundred of which are now being published for the first time in " The Polaroid Diaries. "
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 1990s. " She wanted real moments, " writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course, there is always one person in the focus: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen him before.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephones in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears bulky moon boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or in Scotland, they also led a normal life. Mary McCartney said according to the BBC that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And it has not always been tidy with the McCartneys.
The Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment like no other medium. Linda McCartney's shots are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to take it at exactly the right moment, " Paul McCartney said.

" We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran "
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighbouring country despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, " Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had " withdrawn because of the US threats. "
Nevertheless, Turkey will " continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues, " said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since withdrawing the international nuclear deal with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of " maximum pressure " on the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not abide by the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. Tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably in recent months.
US government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. The US State Department declared on Thursday that the annual upper limit of a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said that while the US remains committed to supporting refugees, the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overloaded.
The US government wants to focus in the future on taking in two groups of refugees: people who are being persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as the State Department's statement. By contrast, a maximum of 1,500 refugees are to be taken in from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Launched in 1980, the program selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettled them in the US. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget would be the lowest in the history of the program. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When US President Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was just under 85,000.
Aid organizations responded in horror at the announced lowering of the upper limit. " This is a very sad day for America, " said International Rescue Committee head David Miliband. The US would further damage its leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US - legally and illegally. According to the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications in the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - " Get close to a spy "
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers in the whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever has given the informant informant accuses him of abusing power " comes close to a spy, " Trump said, according to a private record of a private event in New York on Thursday. Several US media report ously.
When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, " That comes close to a spy. " Then Trump added, " Do you know what we did in the old, when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayals, we used to deal with it a bit differently than we do now. "
Observers assessged the latter remark to a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats sharply criticised Trump's statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment procedure against him, the chairmen of the committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Supervision wrote.
In a recently published complaint, the whistleblower accuses the president of having abused his office to request interference for interference in the 2020 US election. Specifically, his controversial telephone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr r Zelensky in the summer: In the conversation, Trump suggested him to launch an investigation against his possible Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower himself and his informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be the CIA analyst.
Refugee boat capsized: baby and infants drown in Aegean
Again and again, people try to get from Turkey to Greece across the Aegean Sea. Boats, which are often much too small, which regularly capsize. Seven migrants have now died in the sinking of a rubber dinghy - including five children.
Off the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the sinking of a rubber dinghy. Among the dead were a baby and four other children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also a smugler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small archipelago of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not yet known from which countries the migrants come. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey transfer to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in boats that are far too small. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 174 people died on this route last year.

Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
WeWork has become the largest office tenant in New York.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small startup to a driving force in the world's most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords must fear for billions in revenues.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to upset the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. A few days ago, the company dropped founder Adam Neumann as boss, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for executives in order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, among other things, the British " Financial Times " reports that WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect. Thus, the largest tenant of office space in New York and London, among others is suddenly off the market.
WeWork rents large office space for a long term and rents it out to members at short members in sometimes small units. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has burned money at a breathtaking speed with this business. Last year, the company recorded a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone the rental costs are said to have risen to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars by the rental of ever new large areas. To limit the loss, the new management is now said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped leasing new space with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with maturities of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, has rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space over the past 24 months. WeWorks new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new space launched onto the market during this time. Without WeWorks Expansion, the office vacancy in the US metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in the " Business Insider. " The situation is similar in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in the prime location.
In the British capital, too, the balance on the real estate market could be noticeably shift without further expansion of the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant in an office building in the centre of the financial metropolis that was bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the hoped-for billions in income. Despite the long-term leases, they do not have access to the - already scarce - reserves of WeWork. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by specially founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of another 262 poachers have been arrested who had fished illegally in the waters, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB told the Interfax agency on Friday.
Just ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot at and three of them injured. This time there were no casualties, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard claims to be patrols to protect its marine biological resources. 30,000 squid were discovered during the renewed inspections. Furthermore, according to information, three fishing and two motor boats were seized and brought to Nakodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the Ria Novosti agency, the Coast Guard found a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
The Russian Fisheries local entrepreneurs, the Russian Fisheries Authority did not issue any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea were already temporarily arrested there in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern Region of Primorsky, Georgi Martynov, also recently complained high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also take small organisms out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed. Also, the vessels themselves would not comply with the hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the arrests last week. According to the FSB, a North Korean man who was also wounded died later of his injuries. On September 17, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened fire.
US imposes travel ban on ex-President Castro
The US has imposed travel bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, as the US State Department in a statement on Thursday with Castro's involvement in " gross human rights violations. " As head of the Caribbean Communist Party of the Caribbean, he presides over a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there through the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. " The disregard for human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela, " American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted.
On Wednesday, President on Trump issued travel bans on members of the Venezuelan elan government and the military. In Venezuela has been the ging of a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition for months. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions on Maduro's government in order to bring him to his knees and help opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents of the government.
New Fridays for Future climate protests
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are likely to start because of the time difference before the protests extend across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
It is relatively unclear how great the worldwide popularity will be this Friday after last week's record participation. Thunberg himself was in good spirits. " Last Friday, over four million people went on strike for the climate. We'll do it again this Friday!, " she wrote on Twitter. So far there have been 6383 actions in 170 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
Last Friday, the influx was particularly in Germany in Germany. According to estimates by Fridays for Future, a good third of all demonstrators worldwide - around 1.4 million - took part in the protests in 575 German cities. According to a list of the movement, this time, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
In August 2018, at the age of 15, Thunberg sat in front of the Swedish Parliament to call on their country's politicians to step up their commitment to climate protection. From this, the Fridays for Future movement emerged within a short period of time. Pupils and students are mainly participating in the climate protests, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politicians in the fight against global heating and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be curbed to less than 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial era.
Thunder a month ago, Thunberg arrived in New York after a two-week transatlantic cruise on a deep-sea racing yacht. There, she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke emphspoke to the conscience of the heads of state and government of the world. In her home country of Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balconies, which envisages a change in fire protection. " This also applies to smoking, " said a spokesman for the Emergency Ministry in Moscow on Thursday, according to the Tass agency. The ban is to come into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should light a fire, then the penalty will be higher. According to the ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Also, grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer permitted.
Strike against cybercriminals - investigators lift servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time raised a large server provider for illegal transactions on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach an der Moselle, through which internationally active criminals operated their machinations.
This was announced by the Prosecutor General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have included the operators of the world's second largest darknet marketplace for drugs, " Wall Street Market, " which investigators had smashed in the spring. According to the Prosecutor General's Office, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyberbunker.
Such a hoster was excavated for the first time in Germany, it was said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the attack action with the support of special forces such as the GSG9, there had been searches in Germany and neighboring countries. It had been the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New Fridays for Future climate protests
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia and Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to take part in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests teil Who are actually Thunberg's backers?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. This makes it all the more astonishing that a 16-year-old girl of all people holds the mirror in the face of the power man of that time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and makes young people rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win over a collection of children and young people. As early as 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a fairer world. At that time, he was also able to win over a crowd of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea in order to get to the promised land, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently set out on a journey to America with a sailboat.
But is there a downside in this regard? Why does it need a share called " We don't have time " to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg rich PR managers at her side. Incidentally, her mother has published a book that has sold extensively, thanks to the in the spotlight daughter. Also well-tried followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably also thick thick for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into its own in the media worldwide very well and a lot of money flows thanks to the impressive action.
Here the spirits differ: Is it morally correct to enrich oneself financially in saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue campaign? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly more important in a democratically society, because democracy thrives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question seemingly pious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses our solar system
A comet is crossing our solar system.
The astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: a foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certain: A comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. It was named 2I / Borisov after its discoverer and is currently employing astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body in question was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov in the Crimea. He looked up at the sky with a self-made telescope, and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was sighted during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain close glimpses of a foreign solar system. Apparently, it is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbola orbit that leads it out of our system.
Comet was seen before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before the time comes, astronomers can observe it in detail. Unlike its predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in its approach, which means that it can be studied from Earth for many months. " The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020, " explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa. " After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020. "
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 " Oumuamua. "
Initial findings on comet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to investigate certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again asteroids employ the researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid raced past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
" Absolutely reprehensible ": Rachel Johnson horrified by brother
Boris Johnson is more lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister clearly castigates the warlike language of the prime minister as " tasteless. " It is not the brother she knows.
" Surrender, " " Fraud, " Treaty ": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to arm - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this met with massive outrage from the opposition, and meanwhile other critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words like capitulation, as if the opponents of leaving the EU were to be " hanged, elongated, quartered, tarred and feathered. " She considered this to be extremely reprehensible. She did not her her brother's version, RachRachel Johnsons, who had competed for the anti-Brexit party " Change UK " in the EU Parliament elections.
In particular, she was ded with the fact that her brother Jo Cox, a pro-EU MP who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi mentioned a few days before the 2016 withdrawal referendum, whose memory could best be honoured by passing through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. " It is very tasteless to refer to a MP who was murdered by someone who shout' Britain first', " criticized now criticized. 's sister. The perpetrator came from the far-right camp camp who felt " " by this kind of language. " It was very tasteless for all those who mourned her.
The Cox widower also sharply criticized the prime minister. " It makes me sick when Jo's name is used this way, " he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to stand up passionand resolutely for what you believe in - no matter matter what view you is. But you should never " demonize the other side. " He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MP. " I have been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it's an indissoluble tension, " Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson's language has also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is " not worthy of this country. " In a joint statement they declared: " In recent days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside Parliament. We should speak to each other with respect. "
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is sending out a strong signal: in the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots will appear, promising " an explosion of fun and energy. "
Latina power at Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming NFL final, the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
" I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo who has incredible strength in the US, " Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. Many people with Latin American roots live in the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida. Shakira (" Waka Waka ") comes from Colombia, Lopez (" On the Floor ") is of Puerto Rican origin.
" I love that the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time - and two Latinas, " Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises " an explosion of fun and energy " for the show.
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed big hits with songs like " Waiting For Tonight " or " Let's Get Loud " and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the drama " Hustlers " in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single " Whenever, Whereever. "
The announcement of the mid-term guests is eagerly awaited in the US. This year, many see the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, well over 100 million television viewers watch the NFL final, it is now extremely popular in Germany.
Last year, there was political controversy in the run-up. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise up while playing the national anthem in protest against police violence against blacks and had been attacked harshly by US President Donald Trump, among others. In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a Super Bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 appeared was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber attacks Egypt's ruler: For the time being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have influence on whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt spent both last week abroad. One of them floated back at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who deposed the Muslim Brotherhood Mohamed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, in 2013, spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's actions against political Islam and did not lose a syllable about rights violations on the Nile - in a week in Egypt Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest the president. He had " no reason to worry, " Sisi said into the microphones of state television at the airport. " The Egyptians are not misled. "
According to the president, the other man who is currently controlling what is happening on the streets, is trying to mislead. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he eludes the grip of the security forces, who would arrest him immediately if he tried to set foot on Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only only a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafés, living rooms and tea rooms of the country: with his YouTube channel " Mohamed's Secrets, " Ali calls on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He approaches the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president indulges in luxury and lets magnificent new palaces be built, they say. Ali accuses the army leadership on which Sisi relies his rule of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with exactly these gentlemen for 15 years in his second job as a building contractor, he seems to know pretty well what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding number of clicks show.
After last week, for the first time since Sisi's grip on power, thousands demonstrated against his rule and almost 2,000 citizens, including prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a " million-dollar march " this Friday. It was unlikely really so many people would venture into the streets. But there were occasional minor protests, for example in Giza near Cairo and in the village of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. Initially, these videos be verified independently. Security security circles it was said that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators tore banners with the portrait of the president to pieces last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces erup checkpoints in the city and on the arterial streets. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed for " maintenance work, " most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And in Rabaa Square, where supporters of the overthrown Muslim Brotherhood entrenched themselves in 2013, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was supposed to prevent discontsatisfied people from gathering: Sisi's future party wanted to hold a large-scale rally for the president just here.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: " Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square, " Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. " Let's not clash with police officers. " But this is not to be understood as a retreat: " All of Egypt is Tahrir Square. "
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
If you conclude an Internet contract, you do not need to blindly trust the speed specifications of the providers. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved in the event of abnormalities.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a contract component and should therefore also be achieved, explains the consumer association Bavaria.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
" The tests of the offerers are carried out however after provider-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated, " points out the consumer association Bavaria on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised service. Those affected do this best in writing by registered letter.
If this has no effect even after repeated requests, customers can terminate and possibly claim damages for damages. However, the event is not successful, only the way of action would help.
Republican for investigation
As the first senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont has advocfor an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are established, " Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action - an impeachment process can lead to the dismissal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to investigate the interventions of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been observing Biden " for years. "
Republicans have so far refrained from criticising Trump for the whistleblower affair; few have shown unease about it. Scott's remarks are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already opposed Trump policies on several occasions, including easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.

In Greece, an unusually large number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people moved to the Greek islands, according to the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.

The increased numbers recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants coming illegally to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take in a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian deported.
However, due to a shortage of personnel, the processing of asylum applications is progressing difficult on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, almost 29,400 people are waiting on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The Worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.

Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Allegedly, Jaqueline Ng had been promised an upgrade by e-mail from Cathay Pacific. However, when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed to board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for Business Class - many passengers dream of that. Sometimes they are lucky and the check-in staff offer a change from Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-proclaimed influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. More than 65,000 users follow Jaqueline Ng on Instagram. On May 30th, it flew from Taiwan to New York and back on June June.
On the outward flight, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, even though she showed an e-mail in which Cathay Pacific allegedly promised an upgrade. The influencer claims to have received the letter from a marketing employee of the airline, while the airline accuses Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: They checked at the head office. And indeed, the employee from whom the mail allegedly comes, is said to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system, in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. She had to buy a new flight tick to Taiwan for 1,400 US dollars (around 1,280 euros).
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests. Cathay had reimbursed her for the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also reimbursed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. Furthermore, the airline's terms and conditions state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and is now hiring a lawyer.
Oil prices fall according to ceasefire report in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar within a very short time on Friday. Recently, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea variety Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The slide was triggered by a Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia in mid-September had brought five percent of global oil production to a standstill. Iran's Houthis rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had claimed for the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand worries, Ole Hansen, head of the commodity strategy department at Saxo Bank, told Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices thus continue their downward movement over the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent almost $65.
Most recently, Bloomberg had reported, citing Insiders, that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia is progressing faster than expected after the attack in mid-September. Accordingly, the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there have been several press reports citing insiders reporting rapid progress by the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker " Stena Impero " is on its way to leaving the port more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently granted release. The crew is now preparing the departure while the ship is still at anchor, shipping manager Erik Hånell told the Swedish radio in an SMS on Friday morning.
However, the US announced that it would move defensive missiles and soldiers to Iran Iranian arch-enemy in Saudi Arabia. Fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and the UK had at times pushed up oil prices in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump are intensifying
In the affair over possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, cover-up accusations have been raised against the White House. Several leading government officials have made intensive efforts to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the end of July, an anonymous whistleblower said. Speaker of the House, Democrat Nancy Pelosi explicitly accused the White House of " cover-up. " Trump spoke of a " witch hunt. "
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that the nuclear dispute will soon lead to a third summit of rulers Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of success of such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The US had so far done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the adviser to the North Korean State Department. He also criticized tougher US sanctions and the joint military oeuvres of the US and South Korea. However, he hoped for a " wise " and " courageous " decision by Trump to bring about a rapprochement again.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he agreeing. Negotiations on disarmament North Korea's nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. Then in June, both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states, agreeing to revive the discussions, but so far without much success.

Pound under pressure - interest rate cut expected
British Pound under Pressure
With an early interest rate cut, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculation on an early interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) is hitting the pound sterling. The British currency fell by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
The sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders, who brought about a rate cut into discussion, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, since Saunders is considered an advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the brokage house ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy of the Brexit hickhack without directly signaling an interest rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU on 31 October without a divorce agreement, if necessary.
More: The British Prime Minister has taken a high risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, argues Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow analytical laboratory is being manipulated - confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and current head of integrity of the World Athletics Federation.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details on the doping scandal in Russia emerge - and they are destroying of credibility that the Russian sport had recovered at the beginning of the year and even partially recovered. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport was revealed. Thereupon the Wada banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes of the country to compete under a neutral flag, at the Winter Games in February 2018 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were also allowed to participate in the World Cups in the various sports, in the summer even the World Cup took place in Russia with the host as participant.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and the aforementioned samples. Data were were to provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases during state doping. They were intended to help punish athletes retrospectively. They were finally delivered three months later.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory has been manipulated. " Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check that the Task Force has received the right data, " David David Howman in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung " on Friday. " We have noted numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada from a whistleblower and those it received from the Russians in January. " Many positive findings were missing mentioned in the McLaren Report.
The World Cup not affected
This is confirmed by the attitude of the IAAF: the Athletics Federation is the only organisation that adhere to the spell Russia. At the World Championships in Doha, 30 Russian athletes are competing under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
Earlier this week, the Wada had already launched manipulations and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening to ban the Rusada again and, in the worst case, expel it from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
