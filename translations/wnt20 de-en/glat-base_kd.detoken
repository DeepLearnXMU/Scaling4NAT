Mystzzles solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists from the Humboldt University in Berlin found this with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. ProProgress was been made on the question of why children defend themselves so violently against tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the approach of a tickling hand triggggers laughter before the touch. This was due to a deep layer in the cerebrum, which already causes the ghter ghter in the tation tation of tickling.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with " laughter " in the ultrasonic range when they are tickled by humans. This " laughter " is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-contact
So far, it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-contact and touch by others - that is, people cannot tickle themselves.. However, the researchers researchers found out in the experiments experiments on the that the laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebrum cortex are suppressed during a self-contact. This is also the case when living beings clean themselves. During the foreign contact and the tiling by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh had been increased.
But if the self-contact contact and the touch by others at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This means that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between the self-contact and the touch of others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-contact activate a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. Thus, they broke off this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showed escape behavior or scarghof terror. This ambivalence is like the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and people.

Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one problem less. The British oil tanker " Stena Impero " held in Iran was able to sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker " Stena Impero, " which has been in the Strait HorHormus z in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After approval by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The " Stena Impero " has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, said shipping manager Erik Hånell. Around noon, the ship had left the Iranian waters. " Nice that it is over, " he told the Swedish TV station SVT.
The Foreign Ministry in London described the fixing of the ship as illegal. " This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law, " said a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on 19 July on charges of having violregarded the rules of maritime law in the Persian sian. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September September The remaining remaining 16 members were doing doing, accordance to the circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaved professionprofessionally in view of the difficult and grusting situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to rethem again with their families as quickly as possible.
The British government suspected behind the fixing of the " Stena Impero " a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar: there at the beginning of July a super tanker with oil from Iran, which is alleto to been destined for Syria, was put on the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of " piracy " and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the " Adrian Darya-1 " was finally released. Assumons that it was a barter to free the " Stena Impero, " vehemently rejected London.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world's oil exports is shipped by the strait. Tensions in the region have worfied ed sely in recent months. Merchant shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The US had left from the international nuclear agreement alone in 2018, which was to prevent Iran from building a atomic bomb and while ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been putting pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a stricter and extended extended other areas. Iran has far resisted the pressure.
Due to the dispute over the " Stena Impero " and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative " Coalition of Hope " for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection powers wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is obding a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
India would actually be predestined as a " war profiteer. " Given the punitive tariffs that America's President Donald Trump imposes on Chinese producers, foreign producers in People's Republic are forced to redispose. Finance leaders of Asian companies who are considering relocating their production from China to another country call India as one of of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. However, this has not only to do with the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war. With with a huge pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be created to play a more significant role in the globally diversified production chain.
But now India itself has fallen into Trump's focus. Dembuuorated by the bwarper in the White House as the " kingdom of tariffs, " America deprived the emerging economy of the trade benefits for 2000 products in early June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, however, the friction with India is merely a sideshow. Moreover, America considers the world's largest democracy through the security-policy glasses. Delhi and Washington share concern about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salley of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just begun a second five-year term, should therefore lull himself in safety.
The problem, however, lies in a different place: the empirically substantiated thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult time in the socialist Republic of India. Also under Modi. Its zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that suffoced any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies now receive faster building permits for for. They benefit from from better better and transport infrastructure, and a more more effective insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for liquidating seemdead companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic optics, much has changed for the better in India in the first five Moof years. However, this does not apply in trade policy. Inspired this to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national Conservative government even established new barriers.
In the West, Modi attto the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renws his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime Minister knows only too well which vocabulary likes Western managers. At essence, however, the " India First " lawyer never moved away from protectionist economic policies, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to rid of of achachronistic processes and thus fit fit global global competition. Businmen who survive thanks to the isolation of their industries are among the regular voters of di's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applauthis short-sighted policies.

The ritor to the finish: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The world top was long since at the finish, when heart-warming scenes took place in the cooled down haliiInternational Stadium. In the first pr@-@ aries of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to waver dangerously. He could hardly hold on his his feet a 300 meters before the finish, ran in an unhealthily posture, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly hhim him and draged him the last half round to the the finish a supporting him. However, the forces were still enough were still enough to stop the circulating wristwatch after the finish run. As if the scene was not curious enough.

Everyone in this situation would have done the same, " said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists.

And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country that was invited for the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he should not even have started. " That's why I am proud to run here for my country, " he said.
He did this emphatically on the evening - and much more intensively than he would have thought. Because this this ic ic deed will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even let his competitor Busby the lead at the finish and voluntarily took over the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this run. It had all nothing used in the end, because the Busby, which had only to the finish with a lot of of help, was disqualified by the World World World Athletics Association just for the reason.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had compup to set set a personal best at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data,, this was achieved with 18: 10.87 minutes, he himself was nevertheless disappointed: " I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes. " However, only in training, best times do not count.

The number of arrests related to the protests continued to increased according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests.

Online distributer: Mail order ers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up on the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate ate back products instead of destroying them.
The companies could not be exempted from the VAT on donations in kind, the ministry explained on a question of the Green parliamentary group, on which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, retailers could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the German citizens send back every sixth package for orders on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - then ended up in the waste. To donate them would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the tax authorities dondonations in kind like a turnover, which then incto VAT.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies cannot not evaluate sfor products accordingly and donate them free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies would have to be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This applies not only to online trade, but also to other shops from moding to the hardware store.
Banksy Art at Auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart star Banksy, " Devolved Parliament, " will soon be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines " the regression of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the attitude shaped by animals and tribes. " From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital, until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist exhibited the painting again - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29. On this occasion occasion the work, which was formerly called " Question Time, " was renamed " Devolved Parliament. "
The image could change hands for a million of millions.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a harsh exchange with the opposition at the the first meeting of the House of Commons on Wednesday after the the al al of a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to complete the already twice postponed Brexit on 31 October if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture depicting a man man breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. The plant is sees thousands thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day entering enter the UK.
Brexit debate is like a " walk in the park "
According to his top adviser, the fieral verbis's's British Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared the election campaign campaign the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a " walk in the park, " Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. " We enjoy that. We will step it (from the EU) and we will win. "
Johnson had severely attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them, among other things, of " treyal " of the people. Alusations that he could put the MPs in danger because they could become the target of death threats, he dismissed as a " humbug. "
Cummings said that the only way to restore calm calm was if the MEPs finally respected the British's decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were upset that the Britain still still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged charged mood, even the bishops of Anglican Church called called for restraint on Friday. " We should talk to each other with respect, " it statement a statement. " And we should also listen. "
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict during his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN general debate in New York. " If this is going badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst. " The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. " You should have prevented that. "
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers each dominate a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn ved the KKashregion region autonomautonomstatus and and suddenly increased the tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government is reacting with hard hand. It is shooting the population at live live ammunition, over 2000 2000 ainainees in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already there there. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt. However, since the takto eover by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has been done everything to avoid a scenario like the times of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by their own government took millions onto the streets. And this is a problem that the el-Sisi regime does not get under grip, no matter how hard it goes against adversaries. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third three in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, must decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It is always critical whenever large parts of the population have difficulties to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv exams in the terminal: BER boss: No more " showstoppers " for capital airport
For two months it was checked whether the complicated network of plants in BER fire protection works in interaction. Operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv inspections in the terminal of the future capital city airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening October October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed examination, but also said that there were still shortcomings to be processed in the terminal. " We have many detailed topics, but we do not have a real showstopper. " He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contained buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve is no longer be too large. The construction display is now to be submitted to the construction office in the course of the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year this was scheduled for this autumn.
Hundreds of shortcomings in power cables have still to be repaired; the Tüv wants to examine them by February. " In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work must continue to be done on the processing of the shortcomings, " said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all dowels on which the cable routes hang. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not work satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time, it is about aprons that which shut down a canvas in case of of fire, so that the smoke does not spread. They drive down too far. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then, there will be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was supposed to go operation operation in 2011. Since began began construction in 2006, costs have risen from from billion billion to around 6.5 billion euros at the opening next year.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. This is why the will happen in a special session of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial Director Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR Manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put put airport finances on firm footing.

In the midst of the price war with low low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA " take over the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna, " confirmed an Austrian Airlines press spokesman to APA on Friday. Previously, " AviationNetOnline " had reported on this.
The Viennese base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will thus de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. AUA will take over in the " Wetlease " from January 2020, i.e. including Eurowings personnel. Three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg in the future, are to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, explained the spokesman. Flight flight times are to be tailored to connecting flights On the one hand, the goal is to strengthen the Vienna hub and on the other hand to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna serves only only as a " production company " for the company sister sister A. Barcelona and Rome, among others, would be served with an AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings device. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and attenattenants ants come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights deparoff under AUA flight number are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but like the AUA in Terminal 3.
A price war broke out at Vienna Airport after the Niki bankruptcy. Ryanair daughter Laudamotion did only announced on Thursday that it would increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airline sends four Ryanair aircraft including crews to Vienna, also in the so-called " Wetlease, " which the union criticized as a bypass structure to the collective agreement.
The challenge of Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years replied on Friday AUAUA CEO Andreas Otto: " We will remain the number one at the site, in five, six or ten years. "

Study on the causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy eating - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really causes a heart failure or an arattack? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
By analysing the genetic material of 9,000 people, hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to investigate the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davos High Mountain ic, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the main controllable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known, it was said. Now, the scientists want to compare the complete genome of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Cardiovascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes possible possible-@-@-changes of DNA - so-called mutations - are known, it was said of the hospital. Every year, about 200 are added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the precthe tion, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmas, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be used in the study of other common diseases, according Stefan Stefan kenberg, Head of the University Cardiovovascular Centre. New findings into the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there was a firm will to use the data to investigate other diseases. So far, the clinic of the Foundation Davos has mainly mainly with allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine Medicine should be created on the local medical campus and a professorship for bioinformatics be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated at the open heart in Hamburg three years ago and very grateful.
The organic samples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the " Hamburg City Health Study. " With 45,000 test persons, according to the hospital, this is the largest local health study in the world. In the genetic decryption, attention is paid to the protection of the anonmised data, the scientists assersured. It is about one petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the genetic material of a person can now be decicoered within 24 hours. The pure material costs for this would be 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, have cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to begin on 1 October, all 9000 samples are to be analyzed by end end of 2020. First results results are expected the following year.
Nigerian police frees hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. After information from local residents, security forces searched the school in the Nigerierian city of Kaduna and discovered the partly underage victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. " The victims were mistreated. Some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers, " Sabo said.
The boys were detained under the pretext of being taught in the Koran and " re". " In fact, the protégés were held by their teachers under " most degradegrading and humhuman conditions, " said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran school had existed for about ten years. Local idents had made the authorities the of to irirregulin in the.. Parents were shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighboring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chaained and tortured: Nigeria's police frees 400 children from school

World Football selection: Further accusations after Messis and Klopps freestyle
Football " Signature not valid "
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Federation Fifa honors the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world footballer election, accusations come to FIFA from other countries. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
Much of FIFA has proved to be disreputable in recent years: the World Cup awarding, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt functionaries. However, the FIFA World footballer election has not yet been suspected of running running uncly - if you apart from the fact that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote more to sympathy rather according to objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now becoming ing: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting overview.
FIFA apologizes in the extent that " the signatures on the election forms were given in capital letters and were not valid valid. " The Egyptian association was contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan's coach also amazed
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation is comprehenable in the case of Egypt, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally rated: with Lionel Messi in first place,, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané in three. According to FIFA, however, the vote was received the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also raised accusations: " Did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my vote is wrong, thank you, " he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
The message came from the association on Friday: Is True, but was of course no intention. The completed election documents were " " ereenly ously " with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was stated in a message of the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had actually voted. " We take responsibility for the administrative error, " it said in the announcement. However, both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, " quite as it says in the official list of FIFA. "
FIFA fa has the other cases examined in an investigation, but stsizes that the electoral process was externally supervised by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World footballer election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: R@-@-ranking Republicans advocfor official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly advocfor an official investigation against US president and party colleague Donald Trump. " I think the investigation is important, " said the Republican Governor of the US state of Vermont, Phil Scott. " Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are established. " He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment process can lead to the removal of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been watching Biden " for years. "
The Republicans have so far held back in criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair, few have shown unease about it it. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already repeatedly Trump Trump's policies, such as the eof environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also called for the investigation. " It's a deeply disturbing situation, " Baker said. " The right approach and responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it. "
As governor of US states, Scott and Baker have no formal say in the proceedings against Trump, which is being decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore particularly symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first Republican senators have also cricritical of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state state of Utain the the Second Chamber of Parliament, that the case was " extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing. " US media also report that the first cracks were opening internally among the Republicans.
The affair could result in the opening of impeachment proceedings against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, accusing him of abuse using power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for impeachment proceedings. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could pursue a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on actual impeachment would fall in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects of success in such a process are low. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment process.
Were torturers on board Rackete's " Sea Watch "?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had illegally for the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship " Sea Watch 3 " and 53 53 an refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations are being made against Rackete. Thus, three men accused accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the " Sea-Watch 3. " The suspects have been caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. " We cannot exclude this, but we have no information on information themselves, " said " Sea Watch " spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects had raped, tortured, and even murdered in the North African country. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). " The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to to atrocities - by repeated and constant physical violence, " the announcement said.
NGO and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. " We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports, " said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why the people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators are also on the ships. " It is therefore very important that this is pursued ored. "
Italy's right-wing ex-Interior Minister Matteo Salvini immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still being investigation in Italy for because for abetting illegal immigration.
Musk strives for delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers.
" We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries, " Musk wrote to Tesla employees in an email published by the industry blog " Electrek. "
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could record 110,000 orders, it continued in k's newsletter. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customers. To do end, Tesla must to up as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares left trading with an increase of over six percent. Price has not increased that much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-figure figures have be produced in the current and next quarof year. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is demand demand, here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were recent losses.
US budget dispute: Again only one bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the US on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided to provide transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase in the expenditure ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again there without spending plans ahead the new fiscal year that began on October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and adopted a Continuing Resolution (CR) until November 21. Without such a decision, a shshutdown would have taken on Monday Monday at midnight, a closure of the federal administration. President Trump still has to put the decision into force.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration is being financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year year that will end on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 expenditure laws, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal administration cannot benefit for the time benefit from the expenditure framework extended from 1.3 llion to 1.4 trillion for the new financial year.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, spending laws reflect priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has or less willing ten of the twelve spending plans that are barely majority majority.
The ghosts are mainly on the issue of resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the Wall to be one of President Trump's big priorities. The Democrats are disturbed with the Wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually planned for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the construction of the Wall the ghosts separate
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to get closer on this issue. More likely than an an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November. Also, a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the background of the continuing inability of the congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated danger of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process gain popularity. Submission of S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the financing of the federal administration would automatically continue at the previous year's level, prevent the travel activity of parliamentarians and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill, according to which all women can use from in vitro fertilization. Thus, the demand for anonymous sperdonations is likely to increase significantly.
The proposal still requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warthat numerous " " children a father " could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an " opportunity " for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs of insemination ination for all women to be borne by social security.
Fertilization with sperm by dead husband further banned
By a narrow majority, on the other hand, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination " post-mortem " is allowed. In Germany, there have been in the the past where women complained in vain of the publication of the sperm of a deceased. Oonents of the advance in Paris argued that such a committed child then had a " particularly difficult fate. "
Numerous members of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic in Motion, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and deputies of the opposition had spoken out in favour of artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They emphasized that a widow would be imposed a " double grief " if her desire to have children remained unfulfilled by the death of her husband.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person in the future, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot have children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain banned.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation payment for the climate: calls for flight tax for universities become louder
There is a lot of flying at the universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate levy paid there in the future. The rectors say that they have no money for it. But now they are also coming under pressure internally.
The universities should also be limited when flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion before the summer break postponed about a climate levy on flights from universities and colleges is gaining momentmomentagain. After the state rectors' conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now now receiving support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university plead for a compensation of service flights. This is " urgently necessary " as a first step, at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoididof flights flights, according in their statement. The cabinet decision decision which was originally planned in July, is is still on hold, because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia again arrearrest North Korean fishermen
According to the secret service FSB, the detainees fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were already arrested. At that time, there was an exchange of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumto his serious injuries. This time, however, there were were injured, it was said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. Consequently, North Korean fishermen were travelling in Russian territorial waters. There, the's Coast Guard states to be be patrols to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 squid confiscated
During the new checks, 30,000 squid were discovered on the boats boats and confiscated. In addition, to three three fishing and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Nekhodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's fisheries authorities had not issued any fishing licences to the North eans this year, after to complaints by local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorsky ye GeorGeorgi Martynov, recently complained of high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These these would also bring even small creatures from the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be decomposed.
In the future only 18,000: USA lowers asylum upper limit
The " most generous nation in history ": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officers in the White House.
The richest country in the world closes off from protection seekers: As the Foreign Ministry in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be further lowered. In the future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will be receive asylum.
The US government wants to once again the the already ically low limit for the reception of new new refugees. In the 2020 marketing year, which will running in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the US State Department explained. In the now almost past marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump's administration has drastically reduced the willingness to welcome for protection seekprotection from around the world in recent years. Under Barack Obama's predecessor, far higher reception limits had in applied.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee program in 1980. Nevertheless, the State Department described the US as " the most merciful and generous nation in history, " a formulation strongly reminreccent of the incumbent US president's language.
A " responsible handling " of refugees aims to enable the refugees to return to their home countries to help with build reconstruction, Trump Trump. He gets a lot of support from supporters for his hard course in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to close. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure over the Selensky affair and a potentially impending impeachment proceedings.
According to the Foreign Office, the US government wants to focus in the future on the admission of two groups of refugees: people who are being persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus come in danger, as the statement of the State Department. On, the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to be admitted.
The US wants people from this " northern triangle " of Central America in particular to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has first concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to reduce immigration on the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female was transferred from the former ine ine ciary the USA at the request of the ArgentBuenos Aires ary to a reception for for apes o in Aires Aires. Sandra,, " born in 1986 in Rostock Rostock 1986, was granted the rights of a " non-human person, " so her release was mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human äffin is unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, she is to live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. There are already 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them " Bubbles, " formerly pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, " Sandra " has to go through a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
After her birth, " Sandra " spent several years in Rostock in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before it was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of " Sandras " fundamental rights, initiated by animal rights activists in 2014, has contributed to the transformation of the Buenos Aires Zoo into into an eco park. Until 2023, a research and educational center for the conservation of biodiversity is to be created there.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme climber Dani Arnold has made a new hussar ride on the almost 3000-@-@ metre high Great Pinnacle in the Italian Alps.
Without a network, double ground or other aids, the Swiss defeated the 550-meter-high north face of the Great Pinnacle in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, t-shirt and only supported by absolute vertigo, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. He thus undercut the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder in free solo speed on four of the six most important European north faces.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The US sporting goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profit regardless of the trade conflict with China. Net profit increased to 1.4 billion dollars in the past quarter quarter (almost 1.3 billion euros). That is 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the Group announced on Tuesday The reason for this is above all the new marketing strategy " Nike Direct, " with which the Adidas competitor addresses directly to its customers online.

Lifelong stadium ban due to racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The-defender ender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and called on his club to take action. " @ officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. # NoToRacism. Priud to being who I am, " wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing for AS Rom since 2016.

Conflict between Iran and the US: Ruhani talks about end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
On his return from the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged offer from the US to lift sanctions. The United States had promised an end to all sanctions in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: " Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no. "
Ruhani describes what events as follows: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had insisted that a meeting to take place. " And America says I am lifting the sanctions, " added Ruhani. The type of punitive measures that should be ended has been under the debate. " And they clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions. "
However, this move was not made in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticized. In view of the current punitive measures and " the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure, " no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope' hope to save the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated with Russia and China, which is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron had like Merkel, hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on day previous, there had been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This increases the concern of a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. The earthquake with a magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmar region off Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the metropolis of millions. Now, the government wants to up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built houses collapsed - among other things, ruust made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning warning for years that large open spaces, which were registered in the center as refuges, have long since been added. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August, the Chamber of Engineering Chamber in Istanbul had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of Thursday's quake was in the Sea of Marmara in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometres, as the civil protection authority Afad reported. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that injured or damage had not been reported reported. The state broadcaster TRT showed people who ran out of the houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security.. Some students ed ed as can be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly earthquake-prakes. Under the Sea of Marmara is a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deaddeadly was the quake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake with a magnitude of to 7.4 could threaten. However, when the earthquake occurs is unclear. In the earthquake on Thursday, it hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private individuals have packed so-called go-bags with everything necessary to stand next to front doors, and schools teach children how they should behave when the earth wobbles. When the next big quake comes is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques collapsed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On the social networks, many report panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted.. It was more violent that on Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official data, the time of the quake is given as 1.: 59 (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was an aftershock, which was given with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday, an earthquake with a magnitude of 4.6 had shaken Turkish Turkish marar region - it was felt until Istanbul. Its epicentrhad was also located in the Sea of Marmara west of the metropolis of millions, the civil protection authority Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake making headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan, too, was hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharged - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become become more likely, he said CNN Türk. " These could be the signs of a larger earthquake, " says Ersoy to the transmitter. " Sooner or later, the quake will also come. "
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania, there had also been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. The earth had also shaken at Lake Constance this year.

McEwan was quoted as saying: " If the parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers shamelessly lie like the Soviet leaders did, when Brexiteers in high positions almost implore the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write. " Von McEwan had only published the novel " Machines like me " about artificial intelligence in the spring.
Kafka's story, first in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself " transformed into a tremendous vermin, " is gradually excluded from family and society and finally perishes. " Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that is upside down, " it said Diogenes Verlag.

Hbing Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
Actually, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated: with him there there will not be a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But which are already of eternal duration with the polarizing British. The recent verdict of the Supreme Court in Great Britain hovers like a sword of Damocles over the bon@-@ head. His suspension of parliament to be stubable to perform its Brexit course until the date of departure withdrawal was annulled earlier this this week. And a law passed by Parliament requires Johnson to bring about an extension of the bilateral talks until 31 October in the event of failed negotiations with the EU. However Johnson had categorically excluded this.
Boris Johnson still thinks a deal possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass noticeably by Johnson. Meanwhile, he made hints during the visit to a hospital that he supported an extension of the negotiations until the end of October in the event of non-agreement:
You know, we will abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that it will work.
And time is gradually running away from the Brexit negotiator in Brussels. Around six weeks, the EU and and British negotiators have time to prevent Britain's exit from the European Union without a agreement. However, even the recent talks have not yet a a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October currently seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, is a further postponement of the exit date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words minister. It fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.

Millions of the videos of Mohammed Ali were shared in online networks. The Spanish-based contractor and actor demands a " people's revolution. " For this Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass rallies with one million participants in central places in the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence could already be observed. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir square were closed. Already in the past days, the police had strengthened their road controls and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians partly on news and photos in connection with the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Susura and Mansura. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted shly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them were arbitrarily arrested - just because they were " in the wrong place at the wrong time, " HRW reported arrested, citing lawyers.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. General has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing the democratically elected ist President President amed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and and partially sentenced in recent years.

During the expedition, among other things, measured with a drone of Greenland glacier ice and fished with nets for microplastic, it was said.
For his " fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's eans, " the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the " Seadevcon Maritime Award " during the Hamburg Climate Week. " For all of us who who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model, " said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. " He is a witness to the changes that have occurred in the Arctic in recent decades. "
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: This seemed too much to two Japanese tourists. Although the bill with 80 euros tip was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
" Such cases damage the reputation of Rome. We ask the police to investigate the question of whether this is a fraud, " demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the association of guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant came promptly. The Japanese had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, justified themselves by the local owner. However, this cannot be seen from the bill. Also, a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, said the innkeeper.
A call to Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump may actually face impeachment proceedings after the turbulent revelations of the past few, the Democrats Democrats to to examine as quickly quickly as with with their in the House of Representatives - there are talking about weeks until a decision is made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky. The accusation of the whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation to the public out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the USA with his complaint, is monstrous: the president has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country to influence encing the 2020 election. He had blackmailed Ukraine's dependence and thus wanted to force it to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be seen in the now published transcript of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not reflect the full wording. However, the telephone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in which center, addition Trump Trump, all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view, the story begins in May 2019, when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selensky, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. " We do not interfere in a choice, we interfere in an investigation what we have the right to do, " he tells the newspaper. One might think it is inappropriate, but " it is not about that illegal. " Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine Ukraine for which there is hardly any basis - " because this information will be very, very helpful for my client and could turn out to be helpful for my government. "
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that fixated on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to construct an occasion for the Russia investigation in the US. but this accusation could never be taken seriously.
This is about exactly the investigation that Trump will talk so prominently ently on the with Selensky in July. Giuliani's and president and the version reads: The former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democrats' presidential candidacy, Joe Biden, urged as the commissionrepresentative of the Obama administration for dismissal of the then then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Chookin, order to stop the the investigation he responsible by the gas company, whose board board son Hunter Biden was active. Biden senior had financially blacktorted Ukraine to cover up his family's corrupt machinations.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General had to leave, the investigation against the gas company was already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Schokin was also accused of being deeply corrupt behaviour, the US government was no means the only Western partner who urged for his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.

Attention: IE VER charge smartphone wirelessly
Practical, but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come onto the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - above all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases s battery
Researchers warn of the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick, this is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If If a mobile phone charged normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. during wireless charging however however, the researchers have always measured more 30 degrees, even with perfect perfect ment of the smartphone on the charging wheel. If the mobile phone is located little next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the the charging wheel increases, which in turn also increases the power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the shelf life of batteries. Every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only loses es capacity, but also does not hold severe for so long overall. Thus, the service life is lower. Therefore, researchers advise advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery replacement on modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the costs of a battery replacement - namely for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable clutter and laborious ous-@-@ fum.. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) a worldwide standard prevails, in which exceptionally even Apple participate, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest traffic jam photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
According to his own information, a Nepalese climer climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within only six months. Nirmal Purja (36) had reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition operator said.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project " Mission Possible. " He has already made international headlines: He is a photo of viral in the spring of climbers in up on Mount Everest.
The image of the mass invasion triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8,848-meter-high mountain and highest peak on earth. In May, eleven climbers had died on the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is bad weather, other other. the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to enable him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. " We suspect that the elephant were poisoned. "
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous earlier rock fortress Sigiriya ya visited by many tourists. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously been harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. Theoretically, their killing is the death penalty.

According to experts, genes are overestimated in the of colorecton cancer
The role of genes in the familially increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. To this this conclusion conclusion by researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a current study. Other risk factors such as familial eating habits habits probably weigh more heavily than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colon al cancer emphasize the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk booup Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) from the industry blog " Electrek. " The demand is strong, so that Tesla could record 110' 000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to customers customers. To do this, Tesla must provide as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares left trading with an increase of more than six percent. Price has not increased that much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360 0,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures have be available in the current and quarter of quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Will British government bypass Brexit law? Johnson cautious
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for ways to circumypass the law recently passed by parliament against an unregulated Brexit. On a corresponding question, he merely told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the exit date if no agreement with the EU was reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a " capitrender law, " which makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law until the time after exit of the EU.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident of leaving the EU on October 31, and the best way is to reach an agreement. "
Iran apparently to drive up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased the pressure on the European contractual tors in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. " Unfortunately, the European states show incompetence or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions, " Rouhani said on Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they were not by their promises, he promised " further steps " away from the agreements of the painstakously negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian atomic bomb, which in return contained the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US withdrew from the agreement on alone in 2018 in order to force Iran with " maximum pressure " to a change course course the aggressive-aggressive Middle East policy. President Donald Trump's administration wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now relying on harsh sanctions against Tehran. Iran has recently responded by reaching the uranium enrichment in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium or at least prepared them for use. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing the set of more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to bear their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of oppressive US sanctions, suspected Rouhani. However, there will still be further talks that would hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the batsituation changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Houi rebels in Yemen had claimed themselves to the attack, but this was considered by the US as a false commitment. " We have nothing to do with it, " Rouhanani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
" Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this, " said Rouhani. However, the European leaders could not done this in the talks with him during the UN General debate. Instead, they had only only to the that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, France President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration would have to be lifted, Rouhani demanded. He called on the government in Washington to switch to a policy of " dialogue and reason. "
Comet of other star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This was only achieved before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a assumpess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depdepths of space was christened 2I / Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The well-travelled comet was discovered on August August by the amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-made telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-up observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not come from our solar system.
After 1I /' Oumuamua from 2017, 2I / Borisov is the second interstellar object to was sighted during a flight of our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get insights into a foreign solar system up close before he disappears on see bagain. Initial observations show the interstellstellcomet resembles bles of our own system, as as the hysical institute institute the Canary Islands reported reported " The current velocity of the comcomis is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which at this distance well above the typical velocities of objects orbiting the sun, " reported Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa in a communication.
According to the analyses, the comet is on a so-called hyperbola train, which leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which had initially initially listed under the catalogue number / / 2019 Q4, received the designation 2I / Borisov, whereby the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar object that was discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I /' Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been ted in approach. Thus, the researchers have many months for investigations. " The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and will still be visible with medium-sized telescopes by April 2020, " explained Farnocchia. " After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020. "
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. Thus, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I /' Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers in a first study. Photordings from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. " The spectrum of this object ressimilar to that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar, " reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comcomets could form by other solar systems other similar processes as in our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years indicates that these objects could open up a new way for the exploration of certain processes in other solar systems. However, it often difficult to how often such often to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly be cepted by a planned satellite mission of the European space agency Esa.
The agency wants to station the three-part spacecraft " Comet Interceptor " (Comet intercepepttor) on a waiting position at distance 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 20. According to Esa Director Günther Hasinger, it should either lurk for a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor like 1I /' Oumuamua.
First Landing on Beijing's New Mega-Airport Daxing
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, the time has come: A first China United Airlines passenger plane has landed at the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honour for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are to be handled annually at the new airport year, and by 2025 it is expected to be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's latest prestige project is also called " starfish " because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn learn from Beijing The The opening of the - and smaller - - in in Germany Germany, which been under under construction since 2006, has been been repeatedly postponed In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger plane landed after only four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: In London to a half hours from a half Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams of this. This should be made possible by a special drive for the 2030s s targeted at supersonic speed (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction action Engines from Oxfordshire, the US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency. " This is the technology that that definitely definitely this, " said agency chief Graham Turnock told the station. " We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced. "
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport,, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until the of of operations in 2003 and took three to three and a half hours.. In 2000, was an accident at the launch of a Concorde at Paris Charles de Gaulle in, in which all 109 occupants were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft aircraft together with the US space space agency. " the " X PlanPlane " Virgin Galactic also has such developments in its program.
" Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport, " writes Reaction Engines on his his homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the " next generation of truly reusable cream devices. "
Riot in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tipists in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about US president's possible abuse of power, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
" I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information, " Trump said on Thursday to employees of the US embassy at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost " a spy " and such was dealt with " a little differently " in the past than today.
This was seen as an intimidation attempt against Tippgeber. The event was not not public. However, several US media outlets distributed audio recordings from the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced preparations for impement ment against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations are based based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who makes serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. Under great public pressure, the whistleblower's descriptions were made published on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received information from several government employees that the US president " uses the power of his office " to have another country interfere in his favor in the 2020 US election.
At the center of the accusations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden, about previous business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukrainian justice. Biden is ahead in the race for the Democratic presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with a view to the Ukraine telephone call: Leading government employees had tried to keep the exact text version of the conversation under the roof. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been made. However, this had been removed from a usually provided database after the conversation on the instructions of lawyers from the White House and was instead in a a specially protected system. So far only only a rough protocol had been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known, and the New York Times reported that it should be an employee of the CIA foreign intelligence service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the " so-called whistleblower " had spread second-hand information that had proven to be incorrect. Therefore, there may be no tipsers or spies.
As Trump said in New York about those who are said to have leaked aked to the whistleblower trigcaused outrage. US House House Chairman Nancy Pelosi responded acted worconcern and complained that Trump's statement once again undermines the government's integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his environment have been running in various committees for months. Given Given the Ukraine accusations, the Democrats are now pushing investigations with new force to initia possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
" The whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation, " said the head of the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of a misaccount of things and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insults ship and had already demanded his retreat months ago.
More than 300 former US government officials from the security and foreign policy sphere, of whom working under Democratic but also under Republican presidents, backed the investigation launched on Friday the an initiated by the Democrats for a possible imachment ment. If the accusations proved,, would be " " unscrupulous abuse of power " by Trump, it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could pursue a so-called impeachment procedure, However, the decision on an actual impement ment would fall in the Senate, where Trump's cans cans the majority majority Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are low. So far, no US president has been severmissed from office by an impeachment procedure.
VW Works Council: Jobs are " " crethly "
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern concerns the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros by 2023 by two billion euros. Of which, 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
A key to this is personnel costs. The " Future Pact " negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be dismantled the car maker if it is virtually proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment insurance will applies until 2029.
As our newspaper has now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production, which are not not up for disposal, are " cre" " reduced via a different way - that is, past the official course. Thus, vacant regular positions would often not be reoccupied.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility to force the re@-@ occupation. Meanwhile, personnel are missing in many places, the labor consolidation is increasing, the concerns of a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would become greater. Thus, the the fear that the vehicle production could gradually be deducted from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. From VW, it was only said: " An adjustment of the employment volume takes place as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve. "
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and manage new projects centrally. This is also intended to reduce costs and also accelerate decisions - the this is on the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Production Director Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: " Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof. "
There are already successes in this way: For example, this year for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann said journalists before journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which will be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will shortened by 1.1 hours. VW does not give exact figures for the production time, according to information in our newspaper it is is around at Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb applies applies internally that 8,000 cars have to be built there every year so that the plant is satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining diesel demand and the problems with the conversion to the new consumption and exhaust gas test procedure WLTP.
As Production Director Tostmann announced announced last year, however, one million cars are to roll off the production line in Wolfsburg " in future. " This should make it possible to le le golf production at the main plant - because the Zwickau plant gives off golf production by converting to the location for e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan developed declined recently. Therefore, the expectations now rest on the Gulf 8. Despite all efforts to build up e-mobility, it should remain the bread bread and butter car of the Wolfsburgers for the time being.
Forced to prostitution with voodoo: traffickers ers ted

The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in dinghies. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to process the alleged sslugling costs of an average of 25 000 euros. Therefore, the the was completely taken them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the infiltration and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels in the trial.

Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In a ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendant union Ufo has once again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will " inform on 14 October about the industrial measures in the LH Group, " said Ufo taribarboard member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its daughter Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining the Ufo for months. This also concerns the question of whether the union has lawfully terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Labour Court Court Lufthansa wanted to to be determined that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court dismissed the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examines to appeal against it. " I think it is unlikely that a second court sees the matter completely differently, " said Ufo Executive Board Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted an application to the Frankfurt Regional Labour Court to have the status of the UFO as a trade union reviewed by court. The company argues that the union had not set up a representative executive board for months and is thus unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the division union, during which numerous members of the executive board as well of the advisory board resigned, including the long-time trade union head Nicoley Baublies. The UFO had suspended an already begun Uvote over strikes of the cabin personnel at Eurowings the end of July because of the doubts about its leadership.

Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of the cities are also causes of the threat, the World Union for servation Nature ((IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 were already at the highest level of the ability and thus facing extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from " potentially endangered " to " endangered, " " angered, " " threatened with extinction " and " extinct in nature " to " extinct. " Overall, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
rowan and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, especially rowan (Sorbus) are threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, told the German Press Agency. " Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats. "
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered " endangered " since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The greatest threat is represented the Balkan miner motte in addition to a hus. It has been spreading from southeastern Europe over the whole continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 specimens. The trees in cities, parks, parks and avenues are not considered in this assessment.
Shruspecies and mosses also in danger
At the same time, the IUscientists scientists created new European Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in recycling recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
" This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet, " said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. " We must limit the human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority. "

US warns federal government against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great, " Pai told the Handelsblatt with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a " national security law " that obliges every company " under Chinese jurisdiction " to follow the instructions of the security organs.
The current law also prohibits companies to inform third parties about such requests, " continues the FCC CEO. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a " declaration of truworthiness " from suppliers.
Berlin initially wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the " Handelsblatt, " citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, " said Pai.
It is " very difficult to imagine ine " that a government agency, " no matter where, would be able to review every single update in real time to detect security risks, " the FCC boss continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The employee company, which supposedly belongs by the company, is not necessarily independent of the government, " Pai told the " Handelsblatt. "
The US would have insights into which government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to promote the position of the US.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleanup work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday as a precaution, the responsible prefecture said. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to expose themselves to the smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that smell spread after the delinction, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police emen and gendarmes were deployed at the fire there.
A gigantic black column column smoke had risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations, which are particularly monitored. In Seveso, Italy, near Milan, there was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that no " high toxicity " had initially been detected in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. Dams had been built in the river against pollution, the prefecture explained.

Is he trying to trick?: Johnson avoids question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticises the " surrender law " passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law stibes ates the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, addressed about this possibility, the Tory politician evuses.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the law recently passed by Parliament, which should prevent exactly that. On a corresponding question, Johnson merely told journalists that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the exit date if no agreement with the EU was reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a " capitrender law, " which makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed on assumption that Johnson could try to use " political harassment " to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law until the time after leaving from the EU. Johnson said he wanted a treaty with the European Union. " We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is that one with an agreement. "
Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings meanwhile, that he felt the political clashes over Brexit as as a " walk the the park " and was confident that the desired exit from the EU will still come about: " We enjoy this, we will win, we will leave it (the note: the EU), not a worry, " CumCummings according to the British newspaper " Telegraph " at a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign " Vote Leave " during the election campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, now acts as chief strategist at the British headquarters of Downing Street. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policies that has led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.

With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, a few hundred of them are now published for the first time in " The Polaroid Diaries. "
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. " She wanted real moments, " writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course, one is always on the focus: your husband Paul - as you might never have seen before.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, calls in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears shapky moon boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but who led a normal life beyond the headlight light on their farm in southern England or in Scotland. Mary McCartney said according to the BBC, that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And, it was not been been with the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's shots are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to take it at exactly the right moment, " said Paul McCartney. " If you tease two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo. " And Linda would have had the gift of always turing exactly the right moment. " She just knew she had it, " Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the frame and the colors are right, which makes " The Polaroid Diaries " not only an entertaining picture book for BeatBeatles fans but but is a great great pleasure pleasure in addition to the anecdotal, where landscapes also look like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly new Beatles album " Abbey Road, " which was released exactly 50 years ago.

US government wants to restrict reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. The US State Department declared on Thursday that the annual upper limit of a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, an cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said that the US would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overloaded.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on taking in two groups of refugees: people who are being persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus been in danger, as the State Department statement shows. On the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala Guatemala and El Salvador.
The the program launched in 1980, refugees are selected from UN camps around the world and resettled in the U.S.. The of 18,000 refugees for the budget year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. The current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was almost 85,000.
Aid organizations responded in horror to the announced reduction in the ceiling. " This is a very sad day for America, " said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would further further damage its leadership in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is strictly trying to limit immigration to the US - legally legally and as illegally. According, the US government government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.

Rental suddenly set: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork rises rising from a small startup to a driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords must fear for billions in income.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to disturb the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. A company days ago the company sold founder Adam Neumann a few days ago, postponed the planned IPO and started the sale of subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the executives in order to gain financial scope for the coming weeks and months. In addition, among other, the British " Financial Financial Times reports, WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect. Thus, the largest tenant ant office office space suddenly suddenly out of the York in London York among London.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and rents it to members at short notice in sometimes small units. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is burning money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company made a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with sales of 1.8 billion dollars. This year, rental costs alone are said to have risen to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars by renting-new large areas. In order to limit the loss, the new corporate management is now said to have drawn the emergency brake and stopped the rental of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with maturities of up to 15 years, in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire property markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, lered almost 300,000 square meters of office space in the past 24 months. WeWorks alone new contracts alone ensure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the newly onto the market at that time time. WeWorks's expansion, the office vacancy in the US metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in the " Business Insider. " It looks similar in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in a prime location.
In the British capital, too, the balance on the real estate market could be noticably noticwithout a further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building bought last year by the savings bank fund fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would have to write off part of the hoped for-billion billion revenues. They do not have access to the - already scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term leases. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually by by-founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company only heres only within narrow limits.

New climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to to take to the streets again for more climate protection.

New Zealand and Australia are likely to start start because of the time difference, before the protests move across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How great the worldwide popularity will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was in good spirits. " Last Friday more over four million people people on for the climate. This Friday we will do it again! " she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.

At the age of 15, Thunberg sat ahead before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 in order to call on the politicians of their country to make greater commitment to climate protection. This has rise to the Fridays for Future movement within a short time. Pils and students mainly participate in the climate protests, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politicians in the fight against global heating and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be contained to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York almost a month ago after a two-week transatlantic cruise with a high-sea racing yacht. There she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN in which she strongly spoke her conscience of the heads of state and government of the earth.

Bke against cybercriminals - investigators lift servers

New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take take to the streets today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests ǀ Who are Thunberg's backers?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the the climate. all the astastonishing that a 16-year-old of all holds the mirror in of the mirror of the power man of that time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and causes young people to stand up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win over a collection of children and young people. Already as 1212, a child named Nikolaus aus Cologne felt felt chosen to stand up for a more just world. At that time, he was also able to win over a crowd of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea to reach the Promised Land, much as Greta Thunberg recently went on a trip to America with a sailboat.
But is there a dark side in this regard? Why does it need a share called " We't have time " to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold far-reaching, thanks thanks the daughter standing in the spotlight. Also well-tried followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the journey with the boat was probably also too thick for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into its own own in the media worldwide and a lot of money flows thanks to the imposing action.
Here the ghosts now differ: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people work work with with stock market brokers during the world rescue action? No matter which position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can quite make sense to critically tically seseemingly pious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is ses ting our solar system at the moment.
The astronomers' conicions have been confirmed: a foreign comet is crosting our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star is ses our solar system at the moment. It was christened 2I / Borisov its discoverer and is employs astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-made telescope and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was sighted when passing through.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to catch insights into a foreign solar system up close. Apparently, the Kommet ressimilar bles that of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reports. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbola orway that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before the time comes, astronomers can observe it in detail. because, unlike its predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been sighted in its approach, which means that it can be examined from Earth for many months. " The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes, " explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa. " After that after, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020. "
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 " Oumuamua. "
First findings on comet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to initial findings, the comet is estimated at a diameter of 2 to 16 kilometers. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comet - because as the IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form by similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years may allow a new way to exploring certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again asteroids occupy the researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid raced the Earth and came dangerously close to it.

" He also complained that an atmosphere had emerged in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory deputy. " I have been torn between loyalty loyalty the family and the national interest in recent months - it's an indissoluble tension, " Jo Johnson explained the move.

An actor and Youtuber plays Egypt's ruler: for the time being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have an influence on whether blood flows back on the streets of Egypt both spent the past week abroad. One of both hovered at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfatfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-General, who deposed the Muslim Brotherhood Mohamed si si, the first freely elected head of state of the country in 2013, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's actions against political Islam and had not lost a syllable about the human rights on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had had " reason to worry, " Sisi said did not misled into the microphones of state television. "
According to the president, the other man tries the other man who who currently currently ing ing the on on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he eluthe access of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor of only a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafés, the living rooms and tea rooms of the country: with his YouTube channel " Mohameds Mysteries " Ali Ali on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He concerns the head of state directly and in a quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president revge in luxury and let magnificent new palaces built, it is said. The army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, Ali Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with exactly these gentlemen gentlemen in his second job as a contractor for 15 years, he seems to know almost much exactly he is talking about about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding click numbers show.
After thousands had demonstrated against his rule for the first time since Sisisi's grip on power last week and almost 2000 citizens, including prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a " million-march " for this Friday. The fact that so many people would venture onto the streets was unlikely.., there were occasional smaller protests, for example in Gisa near Cairo and in the town of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests, whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. At ally, these videos could not independently verified fied. It was said that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators tore banners with the portrait of the president in last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces set established checkpoints in the city and on the arterial roads. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed for " maintenance work, " most of the around around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on Rabaa Square, where supporters of the overthrown Muslim Muslim Brotherhood si i entrenched in in 2013 until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent dissatisfied from from here: Sisi's future party wanted to hold a large scale rally for the president here.
Mohamed Ali prompted these precautions to change his tactics: " Our goal does not have to be the Tahrir Square, " Ali said in Barcelona in his video camera. " Let's not clash with police officers. " As a a retreat, this is not to be understood: " All of Egypt is the Tahrir Square. "
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
Anyone who conclude an Internet contract do not need to blindly trust the speed information of the providers. Customers can check themselves how much of it is actually achieved in the event of abnormalities.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore be achieved, explains the consumer association Bavaria.

On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: They checked cked at the headquarters. in fact, the employee from whom the mail allegedly came is said have denied the mail contact with Jaeline. This was also confirmed by the mail system in which the news did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (around 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new titicket to Taiwan.

The airline's terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now calls on a lawyer.

Doping: Further Russian manipulations proven
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - as confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's integrity leader of the World Athletics Federation.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details of the doping scandal in Russia come to light - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and even to some extent. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the samples samples from the years 2012 to to the World anti-doping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: They were forged.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports had been revealed. Thereupon, the ada had blocked the Russian anti-doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time time Russian Russian athletes were not completely banned ished from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes of the country compete under a neutral flag after individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, at the Winter Games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were also allowed to be part in the World Cups in the various sports, in the summer even the World Cup with the host host took place in Russia as participant.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, the Wada lifted shed the Rusada ban again, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help to punish athletes later. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Athletics tics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory have been manipulated. " Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force received the right data, " said David Howman in an interview with the " Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung " on Friday. " We have identified numerous discrepancies between the data that the ada received from a whistleblower and those it received from the Russians January January. Many Many positive were missing mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organization to stick to to the spell of Russia. 30 Russian athletes under a neutral flag start at the World Cup in Doha. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already launched manipulations and called on Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the re-block the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
