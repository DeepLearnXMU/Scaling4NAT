un chief says there are no military solutions in syria
secretary-general ban ki-moon says his response to russia's military support for syria is that " there is no military solution " to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
the un chief has again called on all parties, including the divided un security council to unite together and support negotiations in order to find a political solution.
ban said at a conference on wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries in the council -- the us the us, russia, china, england and france this month on the general assembly's ministerial session to discuss syria.
ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the syrian people and regional powers " have made this unresolved. "
ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in syria.
8 poll figures show that donald trumtrump has real chance
some have tried to label it as a " flip-flop " politician.
others called him a joke.
and others are waiting for implosion.
but regardless of the way some republican ans are trying to remove donald trump from poll top, it has not worked (yet).
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown donald trump leads to two figures, and some are starting to question what this means for the real estate mogul's possible appointment.
it is, of course, still premature.
none of this says that trumtrump will win the race to nominate the republicans.
pundits shows that during the same period of 2011 rick perry's advancement made room for herman cain in the polls, but none of them won in any nomination race.
and the reasons for hard struggle in the general elections are numerous.
but outside groups such as jeb bush's super cap and the conservative club for growth group recognise trump's power and start to support it with money.
we continue to give you some figures from recent polls that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing one:
the figures showing support for trump returned to 180 degrees.
even before donald trump announced his candidacy in mid-june, a poll by the university of monmouth shows that only two out of 10 republicans had a positive opinion of the real estate mogul.
by the middle of july, the percentage has climbed to 40%.
in early august, it was 52 per cent.
currently, six out of 10 republicans have a favourable view of donald trump.
about three out of 10 say they are negative.
these figures remain.
a poll last week by quinnipiac in iowowa concluded that 60% of the regional republics have a favourable view of trump.
two-thirds of gop voters would be happy if trumtrump won the nomination race.
in a poll by cnn / orc last week, 67% of the republics said they would be " enthusiastic " or " satisfied " if trumtrump won the nomination race.
only two out of 10 say it would be " upset " if trumtrump wins the nomination race.
only ben carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as trump (43% say he was " enthusiastic " about 40% who say the same about trump).
is it closest in terms of enthusiasm?
marco rubio, with only 21%.
on the other hand, 47% of republican voters say they would be " dissatisfied " or " upset " if the favourite jeb bush wins the nomination race.
most republics do not consider trump's temperature a problem.
although donald trump has been strongly criticised for his insults and bombastic style, 52 per cent of national republican voters believe the real estate mogul has the right temperature to be president, according to a poll conducted by abc news / washington post on monday.
we find ourselves the same figures in iowa state, where still 52% of the republics believe that trump has the right personality to lead, according to a poll conducted by quinnipiac last week.
however, 44% believe he does not have the personality to act effectively and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperature has no place at the white house, according to abc / post.
republican voters are getting used to the idea.
when taking attitudes to intellectuals, republican voters consider the trump to be authentic.
according to a poll conducted by cnn / orc last week, the question of who has the best chance of winning the race for gop nomination, four out of 10 said that trump.
the situation changed since the end of july, when four out of 10 bet on jeb bush.
full information: in the past, the gop voters have not read the future very well.
during the same period of last elections, four out of 10 republicans chose rick perry in the nomination race, from only 28% for mitt romney.
however, these figures show that the majority of gop voters consider trumtrump's campaign plausible.
even if the republics or reign to another candidate; trumtrump still leads all.
some say the divided situation will likely contribute to trumtrump's victory, while support for trump will split into more than twelve candidates.
but a poll in early september by university of monmouth shows that the hypothetical situation of collaboration between trump and most of the other republican candidates, almost always trumtrump will benefit from majority support.
trump is from 13 carly fiorina points at 14 marco rubio points, at 15 walker points, at 19 points of jeb bush bush, finally, 33 points each than to paul, john kasich and chris christie.
it is almost equal with ted cruz.
is the only candidate to beat him?
ben carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation of one to one.
most of the supporters of donald trump say they have been decided.
a new poll by cbs / nyt on tuesday shows over half of voters supporting trumtrump say they do not change their choice.
obviously, much can happen here and no one can say that they will never change mind.
46% say it leaves the window open to the possibility of changing its choice.
however, trump's most important adversary is currently ben carson neuroneurosurgery, but it is twice likely that voters who say they have decided to vote with trump.
six out of 10 republics say they agree with trump on immigration.
since donald trump has the immigrants from mexico " rapists " in his campaign's opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the focus in the 2016 campaign.
some are concerned that trump's bombastic style will lead to a division between important hispan voters and the republican party and will damage efforts at rebranding.
but according to a poll conducted by abc / post on monday, six out of 10 republics say they agree with trumtrump on the immigration issue.
so it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will doland trump remain.
frustration with the authorities is reaching new crops.
donald trump and ben carson are now supported by nearly half of republican voters, largely because of their outsiders.
according to a poll conducted by abc / post on monday, six out of 10 republics say they prefer a political outsider at the expense of someone with experience.
people also upset washington.
a poll two weeks ago in iowa by des moines register / bloomberg shows that three out of four iowa republicans are frustrated with the republican performance in the congress, with 54% saying they were " dissatisfied " and 21% " nervous and slees. "
jeremy corbyn makes debut at prime ministry's questions
ever since his election, the start of mr corbyn in pmqs has been long awaited.
the new labour party leader jeremy corbyn will later make his debut at prime ministry's questions, first faced with david cameron.
mr corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be closely closely by the media and labour parliamentarians.
as part of weekly appearances, he called for " less theatre and more deeds. "
he also said he can give up several participations and give in to his colleagues.
the confrontation will be mr corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after calling a " fantom cabinet " and after his speech at the annual tuc congress on tuesday.
meanwhile, the decision of the labour party leader to remain silent at the national anthem anthem's news at a service that was held tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the battle of england has drawn criticism from conservative lawmakers and has made the headlines.
corbyn's decision not to sing national anthem drew attention
a spokesman for mr corbyn said that he' kept silent in a respectful manner' and has recognised the' heroism of the british air forces in the battle of england'.
but a member of mr corbyn's fanhost cabinet, owen smith, told the bbc's two's newsnight show that he would have advised the labour leader to play the national anthem " regardless of " his belief that monarchy should be abolished.
around a dozen anantom cabinet ministers refused to be part of mr corbyn's leading team, arguing by differences of opinion on economy, defence and foreign, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
bbc political correspondent robin brant says the policy differences " cumulate " in the labour party following mr corbyn's appointment of his position towards the eu and the benefit limit.
mr corbyn said at the tuc conference that the labour party will bring changes that would help eliminate the idea of limiting completely.
several hours later, labour and pensions minister mr smith said that the party' is very clear' in exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the' cap' level from 26.000 to 23.3,000 lira.
mr corbyn will be the fifth labour leader facing david cameron in the gallery in the past decade since he assumed the helm of the conservative party.
the labour leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, says that he has some' from external sources' ideas for questions he would put to mr cameron and that he has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
mp islington north said that pmqs implies too high a level of confrontation and it will refrain from replicshocks and attacks, pledging instead to undertake to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
mr corbyn said that angela eagle, the finance minister, will hold his place in pmqs when he cannot attend - for example when mr cameron moves abroad.
he also expressed the idea he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying he had dealt with chamber of deputies chairman john bercow to discuss the issue.
in 2005, when he took the lead, mr cameron said that he wanted to give up the' punpunch and judy' style often associated with pmqs, but acknowledged a few years later that he failed to do so.
since its first transmission, in 1990, the pmqs has been widely seen as a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, the way it heads the chamber of deputies and its position among its fellow parliamentarians, even though critics say it has become a caricature and that it needs a deep reform.
'framework in jobgeon': young homeless receive photo training
it is difficult to be a homelessness in johannesburg.
but a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and earn a living.
" he was shot in the geon " is a non-profit studio teaching young people homeless to take photographs of the areas they live and earn money from it.
the bbc news met with one of the first graduates of the project.
jd sports says higher wages could harm enlargement
jd sports president peter cowgill says an increase in the minimum wage in the uk could mean " a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers. "
however, the purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher costs for the workforce within the firm, he says.
the costs could have an impact on jd sports's enlargement plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
tennis australia president steve healy thanasi kokinakis
thanasi kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticised for his behaviour.
thanasi kokkinakis was the collateral victim in the " storm " he created around his friend, nick kyrgios, and his behaviour deserves more prapraisworthy words words does not criticise, in the opinion of tennis australia president steve healy.
kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented panel often called " special ks, " was unpleasgged in the light of the spotlight by the scandalous derapage that mr kyrkyrgios had to stan wawrinka at the montreal masters tournament.
in a quarly qualification match played shortly after, in five year, the wheelelree had to intervene intervene twice to divide up kokkinakis and his opponent ryan harrison, after which harrison said " wawrinka should have put the back on his giks. "
although he was last seen with a missile powder after crampe musculare and missed a possible us open tournament, upset richard gasquet, kokkinakis was firmly defended by healy.
the teen is currently in glasgow, where he fights sam groth for second place after bernard tomic in the davis cup semifinal against england.
" one thing i feel strong is that in my opinion, thanasi was attracted a little bit into conflict, " healy said.
the truth is that he broke off a rocket when he lost because he accused crampe in the us, but it is not the first player to break a missile from frustration with himself, and i know thanasi well enough to know that he would not be proud of that.
but let us be serious, it has managed extremely well in rather challenging situations in us with harrison and so on, and i think it deserves much confidence.
it has an extraordinary team, it has a great family and i think it has been treated unfairly.
he is a 19-year-old-old very mature, is working hard and integrating integrated into the team, he has had no conflict with the other players, he is highly respected in the west, he is very hard, he is in an excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young man and i think he is worth being tried solely on the basis of his qualities qualities and shortcomings.
healy also backed the decision not to take kyrgios back into account for the important replay match, which starts friday, and described the " joint decision " as the most appropriate for all, but advocated the return of the original player from canberra to the team.
" first of all, we want the team to focus fully on the replay game and not think think at all about the controversy around [kyrgios], " healy said.
and i think nick moved very quickly, as people such as federer and murray ray, he matures under the public's eyes and made some terrible mistakes and deserve criticism, but we are trying to support him, trying to help him understand the consequences of his facts and i think he needs a time when he is not at the centre to reflect,, which is good for his team.
2016 elections: hillary clinton's advantage to bernie sanders narrows to half in national polls
former secretary of state hillary clinton still has a two-diglead in the democratic race for national candidacy, but senator bernie sanders is gaining ground.
clinton is now backed by 47% of democratic voters (falling from 58%), while sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
vice-president joe biden, who has not yet to run for president, is backed by 15% of democratic voters.
at least five months before the start of the primary elections, the majority of democrats say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
but clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
against the cbs poll last month, clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while sanders won several per cent.
clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has narrowed.
support for men has fallen considerably, and sanders is only 5 points away.
clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and now on a par with sanders.
clinton, however, is still in advantage among older voters.
last month, clinton faces a two-digof sanders among the liberals, but sanders now has a slight 5-point advantage in this group.
about half of democratic voters at national level say she would enthusiastically support clinton if she chose to run on behalf of the party.
a quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it only because it represents the party.
six per cent would not.
perhaps unsurpriable, the likelihood that clinton's current supporters will be excited about her election is high.
opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
while 48% of democratic voters say they enthusiastically support clinton, the number of republican voters who say the same about first place, donald trump (35%) is lower.
when clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has proper experience (16%), followed by the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this post (10%).
clinton's supporters also mention her association with bill clinton (9%).
the agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
since the vice-president considers possible presidential candidacy, 57% of democratic voters would like to see it in the race - although a third believe that he should not run.
to the question of a second option for the party representative, the democratic voters mostly call biden.
of clinton's supporters, more than half say that biden would be the second option, well ahead of sanders.
if biden decides not to run for democratic party race, hillary clinton's advantage over sanders grows, from 20 points with biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of democratic voters consider clinton the most likely to win the general elections; but the figures dropped from 78% last month.
biden is second, however, the percentage he is most eligible has increased.
however, when asked what is most important for an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
as last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is viewed by these voters as unacceptable as a party representative in the presidential race.
democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well on several key features towards their party's primary voters.
the majority of voters see clinton, sanders and biden as integrated and trusted and with solid leadership qualities.
biden is seen best of all three in integrity, while clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not believe that h. clinton is also integrated and reliable as twice as those who say this about sandsanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion about it.
democratic voters also generally believe the three, clinton, sanders and biden, have the same ideologies as they.
on all of these issues, about a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion on sanders.
as questions persist about the use of a personal email address and server by hillary clinton when she was secretary of state, most democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject, and say she has not affected her general opinion of the candidate.
but this is not the case among the us public.
half of the americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
public opinion was divided in march on the issue, shortly after the issue came to light.
most americans say the controversy over the email has not affected their general opinion on clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion negatively.
mainly the republics, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their opinion on clinton in the negative sense.
although democratic voters see clinton as integrated and reliable, this continues to raise problems among voters in general: only 32% consider it integrated and reliable, 8% less than last month, and 15% less than in may.
as many as 62% voters do not consider it integrate and reliable.
at the same time, 55% of national voters do not regard trump as reliable and worthy.
however, both clinton and trump have white leadership.
of the six candidates who are evaluated, biden, carson and bush are the first ranking in terms of integrity.
the number of those who consider sanders integrru is greater than those who do not agree but, as in the case of carson, many have no opinion on it.
the margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
five brothers charged over the murder of 1 student at the baruch faculty
nearly two years after a university student lost his lives during an initiation ritual in the pocono mountains in pennsylvania, five people have been accused of murder.
members of the pi delta psi frtherhood at the baruch faculty in new york have brutally attacked chun " michael " deng during an initiation ritual in september 2013 and postponed him to take him to hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police.
official sources say the victim has been tied to the eye eye, a backlog backpack was put the back back of 1400kg full of sand and has repeatedly been bullied down while trying to move towards a target, on frozen ground.
mr. deng accused headache after which he lost his knowledge.
members of the pi delta psi frtherhood did not sound emergency numbers after fainted and claiming to have waited an hour before taking it to hospital, police say.
but they found the time needed to change deng's clothes, look for symptoms of google and contact andy meng, president of the national brotherhood, to seek his advice, police chief chris wagner said at a press conference.
" at this moment, members have started to hide personal goods and practically put the good of the brotherhood before michael deng's good, " wagner said.
it could not be resuscitated and died the next morning.
according to an autopsy report, deng suffered repeated tramas, trunchi and coapse.
" too many families have been devastated by fringe rituals since 1970 at at least one student died every year due of rituals, " douglas fierberg, a lawyer for deng's family, said in a statement.
the brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
the monroe district grand jury recommended that the first five members be charged with three-degree murder.
thirty-two brokers, including mr meng, will also face charges of ultraand complicity in the murder.
" we want to hold accountable not only the people involved but, if there is an organisation that authorised the brotherhood, officially or informally, we will also hold it to account, " the wagner said at a press conference tuesday.
the baruch faculty banned brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representative.
that is what will happen when the federal reserve increases the interest rate
the interest rate will increase and the growing bull market market) will collapse, bond profitability will rise and the economy enters into recession.
we know.
what we do not know is how long it will happen and how long it takes.
in the economy, history offers little time signs.
after the first increase in the interest rate, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
the aggressiveness of the federal reserve to raise interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
that is why us central bank officials have emphasised so strongly that investors should not focus on the moment the interest rate begins to increase but on the trajectory of the time needed for normalisation.
indeed, there are a lot of variables at stake.
but in the end, the market players may see that all the distagr about the increase in the interest rate has been exaggerated.
" the first increase in interest rates decided by the edf after the world financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the " cheap money era, " julian jesjessop, chief economist at capital economics, said on a note to customers.
on the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of us interest rates to more normal but still small levels to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear afraid.
however, it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
we continue to present the way in which several sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
given the situation that the market has been facing in recent months, anticipation of rising interest rate may potentially volatile things for a while.
but at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
" it seems that there is a tendency for the profitability of capital to stagnate for 12 to 24 months after the first growth, which can again reflect the gap in monetary policy, " deutsche bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the edf increases.
specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has increased sharply - by around 14 per cent - moving towards an interest rate increase, quite invariable over the 250 days after period (average hurup of 2.6%) after which it return to normal after 500 days, with an average return to six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on barron by the nunuen management strategy.
deutsche said the impact on shares would tend to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits are beginning to decline.
the recession is a reality of economic life, but increasing the interest rate often contributes to it.
in the current situation, the edf faces conditions that have not existed before and could accelerate a recession.
more specifically, gross domestic product will come closer to its historic minimum point for an increase in the edf interest rate.
according to deutsche bank, out of the 118 increases in the interest rate after 1950, only twice roll-call gdp was less than 4.5%.
even though in the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the edf atlanta.
raising the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question " whether it is different this time, " deutsche said.
market players prepared all this year for a growth decision from the edf with all eyes eyes towards a meeting this week of the federal open market commission ending on thursday.
although many strategists and economists say fomc could approve an interest rate increase during this meeting, long-term transactions point to only 25%.
" in our study carried out after 1950, all interest rate growth cycles so far have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with gdp dromissing missing peaks before the recession very quickly after the recovery began, " the report said.
on the contrary, this has been a bizarre of sluggish recovery after the worst recession in the period under consideration.
the current cycle is by far the longest awaited by the edf since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it has reached 74 months and continues.
the fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the printing is somewhat similar to that of the dividends.
the main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of actions when the edf now changes policy.
in the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits are changing the direction as soon as the first growth / drop in the cycle occurs.
at the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the profitability of bonds falls immediately, " deutsche said.
strategies charles schwab believe that these increases in the interest rate will bring the cost of profitability between short-term and long-term bonds closer, bolrelieving curve.
high-cost bonds do better in such an environment, although " we are still wary of forcing profitability, " kathy jones, a fixed-income analyst with schwab, said in an analysis.
interestingly, jones believes that the markets have already adapted to edf policy expectations.
" in addition to the strength of the dollar and lowering estimated inflation, there are several signs that the market adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy, " jones wrote.
short-term interest rates have increased, curon profitability is fairer, the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded, and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when edf tightens politics.
broadly speaking, majority companies in the us will benefit from an increase in interest rate, and local products will become more attractive.
high-indebted multinationals will suffer because the dollar will make their products in the global market more expensive and their debt will be more expensive.
" history shows that " quality " stocks are tend to be more profitable in the three months after an initial increase in the interest rate, " analyst analyst goldman sachs said in a report to customers.
strong balance firms exceeded those with a low balance after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
large capital collection companies and low volatility stocks have also exceeded similar low-quality companies with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
debt will become an important problem.
companies with a large percentage of flolower debt have the most to lose, goldman says.
consumers will also benefit from the dollar.
the savings could also benefit, although experts disagree on how quickly this happens.
bbc radio 3 copy a fm classic, says lawmaker andrew bingham
conservative lawmaker andrew bingham criticised the radio for " prostoning "
he says increasingly similar to trade opponent
it also took bbc music awards eye, planting brits awards
fellow member damien collins attacked the voice voice, saying the show is not original.
bbc radio 3 is " turning into " fm classic, a senior lawmaker said under pressure to prove he is doing something that is not doing.
conservative lawmaker andrew bingham also told the bbc heads that the public radio station " prostish " and is increasingly resembling trade adversary.
" i have the impression that radio 3 " breaks " -- although i don not like to use the word -- but i feel it is turning into fm classic, " he said.
it also watched the bbc music awards, launched last december.
the bbc music awards, launched last year, appears to be brits under another name.
so, if you try to do something different -- these are the two examples that come to mind that only copy what is already happening on the market, " mr bingham said.
the bbc director-general denied the accusations, saying the bbc radio 3 is well in front of its commercial opponent regarding live music and public education.
i will not know anywhere about the classical music from radio 3.
and his commitment to live and production is no rival.
" furthermore, i think it is also important for radio 3's commitment to discover new music and the allocation of new parts, " he said.
in the first part of this year, bbc radio 3 editor alan davey said he must do more to draw an audience from the previous period because the british have less knowledge of classical music.
but radio 3 was not the only element under the bbc logo criticised at the meeting of the culture, media and sports committee for following the traces of its trading rivals.
conservative mep damien collins attacked the voice - the bbc talent show from dutch producer talpa media for around gbp 22 million.
do you understand why there is often talk about that issue because it is not original and does not distinguish from anything?
lord hall insisted that the bbc1 show -- targeting paloma faith, and boy george in juriu -- be realised " in a specific bbc manner. "
he added that he wants the corporation " to find gold eggs in his own wheat " next time when he launches an entertainment show.
however, he refused to ban in the future the takeover of new seasons from the voice or spend money on licences on other entertainment ats.
internet sales lowest in august, face black friday
in the first three months of 2015, online sales rose 7%.
in the past month, there has been the most sluggish growth since 2000.
online sales gained momentum three years ago, due to the use of the mobile phone to shopping.
specialists say the black friday in november could lead to reticence in spending.
for more than a decade, online shopping has rocketed and have turned britain's commercial streets into fanhost cities.
but specialists say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, with the latest figures indicating a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
the total money spent in august showed the lowest growth since 2000, with an increase of only 5 per cent over the past year.
specialists say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, with the latest figures indicating only 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
" if we look at the level of growth in previous years and we go back to 2000, there has always been rationalised over time, " imrg sales index editor andy mulcahy told the guardian.
he explained that online sales gained momentum three years ago, when buyers began using the mobile phone to make purchases.
thus, it has increased the number of people who were shopping online and do so under different circumstances, such as cancany.
but now that it is stagnating slightly, you could see a decrease (in growth).
the black friday phenomenon, imported from america, is cited as one of the reasons for falling sales.
in the opinion of the specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases ahead of the event in the last friday in november.
last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked to computers to put hands on offers, leading to the collapse of retailers' sites.
specialists say black friday, when shoppers walked on bargains, could trigger the buyers' reluctance.
a study by the british retail consortium determined that at least 1 lira of every 5 is spent online.
for certain products, such as tv sets and washing cars, more than a third of the purchases are currently being carried out through online shops.
at the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and online shoes than resort to fashion shops in commercial areas.
after punishing the bin laden family, muslims buried the victims killed following the collapse of cranes in mecca
the bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked down muslim streets, with the first funeral in mecca.
saudi arabia partly blamed saudi construction giant binladin group for collapse.
health minister says a total of 394 people crashed
at the street walk ceremony, hundreds of muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a collapsed crcrcrle at the mecca mosque.
dressed in white, those complaining about death joined on the road to express their condolences until the first dead reached the end of the final journey at al-moaissem cemetery.
the sad memory of the holy place, where only a few days ago, a construction house collapsed through the mosque mosque's ceilings, falling on believers.
the bodies were released for the funeral after saudi arabia's king penalised the bin laden family construction group for the disaster, which also resulted in 394 wounded.
at the street ceremony, hundreds of muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a collapsed cranes at the mosque in mecca.
the victims included the father of four children, qasim akram in bolton, great manchester, in his first pilgrimage when crashed crashed.
mr akram is in the great mosque with his parents before the start of the hajj pelgriinage.
saudi authorities have already promised that hajj pilgriinage in mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims.
today, king salman said that the binladin group should not have left the arm of the big cranes when the slaughter was not operational.
an arab version of the decree published by the saudi news agency, said the binladin group partly partly blamed for collapse.
the news agency's english service did not reveal the detail, but said the company's leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
earlier this week, salman vowed to disclose what caused the collapse of cranes in the mosque court, where hundreds of thousands of muslims came before the hajj pelgrims later this month.
the binladin group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the cranes, and group representatives could not be contacted for statements.
the royal decree blamed the group for failing to use up-date safety measures and did not coordinate its work with weather authorities.
dozens of cranes surrounding the mecca ca mosque as part of the massive construction effort by the binladin group.
for several decades, the binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of saudi arabia and has been carrying out major construction projects.
qaida's last leader, osama bin laden, was a " reneged " son, who was inherited by the family in the 1990s.
the collapse took place in wind conditions and rain rain just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in royal to participate in pilgrimage, an essential journey, at least once in the life of every muslim physically set.
authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
the authorities have decided the relatives of the deceased victims should receive one million saudi ri( gbp 174,000 000) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent injuries.
other injured are expected to receive half of that amount.
advantages, disadvantages of credit conversion into swiss francs
two offers of conversion into the swiss francs have already appeared on the banking market, the main benefits being to exclude currency risk and reduce the rates.
the disadvantages can come in a few years' time, when the variable interest can lead to an increase in rates.
the transylvania bank has just completed the process of converting loans into francs granted by volksbank, and the post has announced the conversion offer for its own clients.
according to data collected by analysts at the finzoom financial portal, the post offers three years of fixed interest rates at the lei, at 1.5%, the lowest in the market.
on the other hand, the transylvania bank's offer of conversion has been accepted by 83% of customers with loans in francs due to two successive cuts: the soil has been reduced with the value of the risk and management fees paid by the customer, then an additional 22.5% reduction to the soil in lei.
both offers reduce the rates of their own clients, compared to what they paid monthly month equivalent to lei before conversion.
thus, the transylvania bank is reducing the rate by 42.5%, and the banknotes, by 33% in the first three years and, in theory, by 18% in the coming years.

the main advantage of the credit of credit in chchf is that currency risk is eliminated, with the consumer protected from future franc's increases, and credit repayment will be made in the currency in which they collect their salary.
another major advantage of both offers of conversion is that property review is not made, no additional guarantees and another proof of revenues are required.
basically, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of credit, nor will there be additional costs as in the case of refinancing.
both banks also offer reductions at the monthly rate, compared to what customers paid before conversion, equivalent to lei.

the problem is that the rate in the first years is made more of interest, and the customer is repaying very little from the principal.
the very low interest offer in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
it is not known, however, how this interest will turn out after three years.
the margin for customers can be higher than 3.25%, so overall, the reduction of costs is lower.
a possible risk for all credits in the variable interest lei, is that the robor index will increase significantly over the next few years (more than the libor - chf index).
for example, robor three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6% in 2009 at more than 15%, and in a few days of 2008, it exceeded 40%!
in addition, it is possible to defend other costs, which are not mentioned in the initial offer.
it is time for decisions on the us federal reserve interest rate
the world looks looking to a meeting scheduled in two days' time, wednesday and thursday, when the us federal reserve will decide whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
in a reuters poll by 80 economists, just over half last week thought the decision would be taken, now believe the situation will remain some while and that interest rates would be kept within the current range of 0-0.25%.
this is an historic event because it is seven years since the federal reserve brought rates to zero.
for the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could drop its zero rate and initiate a process of normalising interest rates, " said angel ubide, chief analyst with the peterson institute for international economics.
the us economy has evolved relatively well, with the recovery bringing usd trillion to the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
however, the federal reserve must not ignore the less rosy global situation.
he warned markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
the decision will be announced on tuesday, 20: the tec.
stars who lost their charm
actor (left), along with his son redmond (right), has experienced stressful situations in recent years.
in 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 lost life partner, farrah fawcett, to cancer.
the actor is also rumoured to have faced the problem of drug consumption, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
all of this certainly has a cost.
manchester united player luke shaw has been on the bara for months over double fracles.
luke shaw suffered a double fracture at his right leg in manchester united in the champions league match with a defeat over psv eindhoven.
after the event bringing tears to the player's eyes and will keep bara for at least six months, louis van gaal remains optimistic that the shaw can play this season again.
the injury followed a reckless intervention by héctor moreno in the 15th minute after shaw, 20, broke the psv defence.
he received medical care for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
van gaal said, " has double fracture on the leg and is in hospital. "
it will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps the day after tomorrow, then it will be operated in manchester.
it is appalling - a boy who came to manchester united when he was 18, has difficulties, then he plays fantastic and now that is happening.
oxigen has been given a mask in the west.
the complaint.
i am not a doctor, but at the double fracture is six months and will not play at the group stage.
i hope they can play this season again.
moreno seems to have had good luck and got rid of the red card and concession a penalty.
refereree nicola rizzoli has not been punishing mexican.
van gaal suggested the italian official was wrong.
you can judge ourselves when they say it is fault and red card.
it was a very ugly intervention on two feet.
a message on shaw's twitter account:' thank you all for your messages, i have no words to express how weak i feel, the road to recovery begins, i will return stronger'.
similar news: manchester united hit by luke shaw's injury in psv defeat
the england team's defender has one additional reason to recover to play at the european championship in france next june.
phillip cocu, coach psv, said, " it is a very ugly injury. "
everyone is all very sad when a player is suffering such an injury.
our players never aim to accidan adversary.
moreno broke off her leg for mexico's national against the van gaal-led netherlands at the 2014 world championship.
" it is very difficult because he did not want to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it is a very serious injury, it is not good, " cocu said.
i have not seen the phase.
i only managed to see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [moreno] achieved it, but i could not see the intervention on luke.
in the statement for sbs6, moreno said:' i know how it is, i know how difficult it is to get through this.
i feel wrong, i am so sorry.
psv player, andrés guardado, also came to the hospital after an intervention from chris smalling.
adam lyth clearly risks england's omission but remains strong
the victory against pakistan in the united arab emirates is a difficult task but after seeing england's team for the tournament, i do not consider a 3-0 defeat in test matches.
i would not rule out a travel victory either.
alastastair cook's team has less experience than three years ago, but he has good players in the batting line and the collective moral is strong; they will not be marked by 2012 events but will have a positive attitude to youth.
moeen ali develops as a thorner and adil rashid, even if unknown to testing, is an option for the attack.
similar topics: adam lyth left the england team for test matches and was replaced by alex halhales
obviously, as his leading coach in yorkshire, i find it difficult to look at the decision not to select adam lyth on the team.
he played the seven test matches against two good attackers under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are tried after the results.
there were no question marks about joe root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and i said this earlier - the players are their own selection.
some fifty years and perhaps lyth would have extended his run run, but his destiny is in his hands.
i hope that if more run run for yorkshire will have other opportunities.
england's chief coach, trevor bayliss, praised his attitude even when his performance did not match his capacity and that does not surprise me; above all, he is a team man.
it is hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is observed in test matches.
lyth had seven run run -- like sam robson before him -- while nick compton had nine.
only compton luck at home and travel.
the only dissatisfaction you can have was that england preferred jonathan trott on the caribbean tour - when lyth was in its maximum form - but that missed opportunity is in the area of the past.
the team comes alex hales, a sman i very well.
it is a cricket player who has " factor x " and i noticed earlier in yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a pitch trent bridge.
at least the same opportunity should be given as those before him, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the uae team.
the idea was launched for the moeen to open beatings alongside cook ok, which would take extra spinner while retaining four quiches and i have nothing against.
i do not see why a cater cannot strike there and this msy player has already shown its naivety.
moeteen did not bring success to his district, worcesterestershire, but there was 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
my old team colleague, justin langer, played his first 38 test matches 38 as the first drop before entering the open in 2001.
it immediately removed three centuries and not looked back.
zafar ansari comes to the team on the back-up spinner post and although i had limited contact with him, he struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
people could judge the early age -- with an average of 31 to beatings and 35 on the ball -- and they might think it is pun, but there is no lot of spinny and the selection opted for young people.
it will learn a great deal from the tournament.
england has made some changes to the training team as well.
the appointment of mahela jayawardene, sri lanka batsman as test matches consultant could be a master blow.
it is one of the best players and it will bring a great deal of experience, as it has played in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
paul collingwood comes to white-ball leg of the tournament, and will bring both energy and ruthless ambition.
i have always believed that he was born to get involved in the international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like mahela, has a ation.
sometimes, new voices in the west, even though i send messages that have been sent before, can bring fresh air to the team.
colly durham's teammate, ben stokes rest for one-day matches, root received a similar break against australia, and i have no problem with that.
although not all agree, coaches and selection do not make the programme.
and you must remember, the jobs of the players depend on the results they are getting.
such decisions are never easy.
brexit camp may prevail if the economy remains in its mill by 2017
every day, the strategy for renegotiation of david cameron to keep britain in the eu is getting deeper into the mess, even without the choice of jeremy genius' yes or no?' corcorbyn leading labour or tuc makes serious criticism of europe on tuesday.
foreigners also have figures like corbyn and nigel farages.
a european diplomat explained over the past few days that - submerged in crises, similar to the one in the eu - not all of which are caused internally - some member states are fed by britain's agenda by concessions and changes to the treaties, which most do not want.
in brighton, at their annual meeting, the tuc decided that they do not want it if they erode social protection.
we could even call it dave and george's' sel' agenda.
the prime minister and the chancellor participate attending bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, make a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and say they have won allies for reform.
it is just me.
my european friend, who wants a great britain with an outward perspective under the eu roof -- " do not leave us with france, " berlin says -- suggests that several short-sighted ministers and officials from certain capitals have come to the point where they do not care whether they stay or leave.
highly cauticautious german chancellor angela merkel is an ally but has been in office for 10 years and wants to leave her position before her situation clches, as happened with thatcher (11 years), mitterrand (14) and kohl (16), who stayed too long.
in 2017, french president françois hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
power, too, is in decline.
poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, left-wing spain.
it is hard to believe they will help english english, whose energy would be better used to prevent scotland from leaving britain - something that they do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
thus, some ministers could even plan to make remarks that do not help, in the snp style, in the campaign for the uk referendum in 2017 to speed up the breedy process, my grandfather suggests.
the " renegotiation has been fixed " and " the united kingdom has not obtained any value from the renegotiation. "
europeans know on their skin how acthe fleet street can be and how sceptical the oligarchic media barons who view the eu with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by tony benn that ratified our entry from 1973 in report 2: 1.
he may remember the vague of boris johnson, the euro opportunistic, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was resent of brussels.
ed miliband knew enemies.
they included the mixture of tax-payers, foreigners who used telephone and pseudo non-domi with most important newspapers.
in fact, tony blair sees them about the same, but he realised that when you are closed in a cucbox with a nervous gorila, you have to give him the bananas to distract attention from thinking of eating at lunch and again to tea.
in fact, miliband was more blairthan blair in opposition to the idea of cameron's referendum, given that blair made a concession on the principle to the abandoned eu constitution, buried by french and dutch voters in 2005, who gave him an exit card.
the media did not forgive him for that either.
but jeremy corbyn, who reached my friendship on the back at westminster on monday - i told him not to consume his time with me - seems to be in danger adopting herou the murdoch strategy to boycott neil kinkinnock, a mistake then and now.
it can last, but it must develop a coherent media co-operation strategy, not me, but certainly with andrew marr whose position on the bbc left a vacation on sunday.
corbyn's official position towards europe is what i would call it softly.
he says he would like to remain in a reformed eu.
most who disagree with conservative' angism' could agree.
that said hilary ary " a benn, but not a " benn on radio and tv this week, when his researcher fought not to recognise that the appointment of john mcmcdonnell by corbyn as minister " from the shadow " on financial issues was a bad idea.
he reminded me the 1970s when his father fought on tv to be unfair to labour colleagues without going too far and without losing his job in the cabinet.
hilary's struggle has been more attractive.
but the fight to remain " in any situation " -- benn's expression -- does not correspond to what mcdonnell said, nor with what jc told colleagues and lawmakers at a private meeting monday night.
regardless of the image that corbyn wants to convey - take note, it has also made me aware - messaging discipline remains important in the era of television, and particularly in the varorth of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and treason.
it is right not to give cameron a favour ticket in europe, allowing him to take good labour support in the referendum campaign, as mcdondonnell said.
simon jenkins believes.
but the basic histry of mcdonnell and corbyin on eu membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a ezoterical discussion among left-wing dissidents for which small differences' narciism is a central dogma.
as in the case of its nato stry - tom watson is adamant that the jc will not campaign for exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand.
why should the paris or berlin of political capital - and there are suspicious voters - waste their concessions to britain when everything could be unnecessary?
the us is already quite disappointed about the english's poor military performance in iraq, libya and syria, even with a cost-cutting conservative government, as i was reminded of the launch of british influence security forum on monday.
specialists criticise england's public health department decision on electronic cigarettes
a government agency said that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with links to the tobacco industry, according to researchers.
specialists from the editorial team of the british medical journal magazine (bmj) joined lancet in criticizing evidence used by the public health department in england (may) in his report on electronic cigarettes.
it published the " reference reference " report last month and described it as a " complex analysis of evidence. "
a number of researchers, however, have questioned the data robustness and have pointed the finger at links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
an article published last month in the lancet medical magazine attacked the " extraordinarily fragile base " on which the main conclusion founded.
two other researchers writing in bmj questioned the claims and base them " on solid soil or on moving sand. "
martin mckee, a european public health professor at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, and simon capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at liverpool university, have said:' a fundamental principle of public health is that policies need to be based on effectiveness'.
they said they expected the allegations's tions that' current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking' are based on an in-depth analysis of evidence and models.
in reality, a single meeting attended by 12 people has led the elaboration of a multi-criteria decision-making analysis model (mcda) that summarises their views on the negative effects associated with various products that contain nicotina; the results of this meeting have been briefly presented in a new piece of research.
mckee and capewell or said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called euroswiss health, whose executive director was said to have, in the past, received funding from british american tobacco to conduct an independent study.
it also validated public health accreditation in a sustainability report, he said.
they added that one of 12 participants in the meeting declared funding received from a producer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding there are reports to have received from the cigarette and tobacco company, philip morris international.
the arguments on which members of the panwere selected were not provided, but include some " underleaves " known in electronic cigarette production, some of them even say in the financing of the industry.
other meeting participants are not known for tobacco control expertise.
the head of the tobacco control section also attended the meeting.
the research work prepared by the group " is " convincing gremorse " that there is a lack " solid evidence of the detrimental effect that most products have according to most of the criteria, " mckee and capewell said.
however, none of these links or limitations are being referred to in the underlying report.
mckee and capewell said the allegations that " " so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers " are premature.
professor kevin fenton, director of his health department, says he has previously responded to claims in bmj.
he said " electronic cigarettes significantly less harmful than smoking "
one in two people who have lost their lives because of this vice.
all the evidence suggests that the risk of electronic cigarettes for health is minor compared, but we need to continue to look at the long-term effects.
it also has a clear duty to inform the public of information coming and which does not emerge from evidence, especially given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
every year, around 80,000 people die due to a smoking-related disease and annual costs incurred by the national health system by smoking reach gbp 2 billion.
expressing the current evidence clearly - that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not risk-free, it only only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national debt.

advertisements that shame britain's arms trade
keep an eye on amnesty international's footage against the arms fair.
terrible horses were killing us!
fiars for crushing glions!
cluster bombs!
and electric batons that are causing horrific pain without leaving traces!
the vesela voice and animated images leaves no doubt that advertising for the biggest world arms fair is a fierce jumade by amnesty international to highlight the willingness of british authorities to sell armaments to repressive regimes through defence and security equipment international at the excel centre in london's docklands.
similar news: dsei arms fair: authoritarian regimes arrive in london
but a separate campaign also led to the display of many posters in bus and underground stations that need a second look.
" the important announcement, you travel with dlr between 15 and 18 september? " says one of the announcements, using the phony and brand of the london metroro, the dlr line becoming the image of a tanc.
in september this year, a lot of arms hills will spread over dlr to customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
the 300 posters are carried out by artists who exhibited works at the cruel designs museum, in dismaland, banksy.
a group, dubbed special patrol group, helped distribute in london using " ad space hack packs, " a 6 lira challen package, which it says " facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in the bus stations on the planet. "
the london transport kingdom is not amused by this " vandalism " as wheel.
one of the parody announcements produced by the patrol group.
according to gavin grindon, a cruel designs ator and lecturer at essex university, artists are asking more questions and seek to make political works accessible to the public outside the gallery.
many artists are heading towards co-operation with protest activists, realising that they must get out of the real world so that their art can have an impact on society.
another poster against the trade in arms that welcomes commuters travelling the metro.
amnesty's film had more than 100,000 visual views on facebook within 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency vccp, which worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and the artist who doubled the voice also worked free of charge.
vccp's creative director matt lever was shocked by the silence surrounding the complaint about the arms fair -- with an empty space in the calendar -- and thought " to give them the campaign they are trying to avoid. "
they played with making a more realistic advertising but " enriching it with strong animations and colours, was more striking. "
" they have done a great job helping us increase our interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair, " tom davies says on behalf of amnesty.
now, the uk authorities would need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not traded illegally and delivered to the door.
perhaps the most creative form of arms art comes inside excel, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
in a press release, saab leaked an order received from the us army on " at4cs rs with the launchers with shoulder support. "

eight golden rules to live at home
11 years have passed since i moved to camin when i was a 19-year-old who still believed in the berets and moral relativity, but only now i remember the forced smiles of those we annoyed - and the numerous complaints against others.
most of the things we have learned can be summarised in the form of eight simple rules.
moving to camin can bring stari that vary from nervous to grohorror.
palavrageala is tempting: to tell the people where you come from, if and where you have spent a year of break ause from studies, what you think about corbyn and why' frankly, you are regardless of marble because, for good boys, it is nothing other than extract of drojdie hahaha, you find me in my chamber'.
breath deep.
and help others to breathe - ask questions and show interest.
they animated conversation and help you differentiate the people that you like from those you would not talk about if the flood came in and they were the only ones to have boats.
do not suppress people.
dormitories often abound with beverage parties, film evenings and social meetings, but they are also the place where people dress and prove their privacy lenure.
similar topics: do you even consider starting student life in a relationship
introverists receive special treatment at the university.
your sleeping should be a refuge, but a sleeping plindering culture is built up in many homes based on friendship, socialisation and friends lasting all of life.
all of this can be terrible for someone who tries to charge their batteries.
nothing in this culture allows you to say' please and i want to remain friends, but i want to leave to recover the energy that have consumed interacting with you'.
try to complain when a colleague is extended by socialisation - and try to send an sms instead of knoat the door.
as a word to the door: do it.
one type that stood at the same home as me had a policy that said that if a door was not incur, then he was invited to enter.
he saw enough.
make friends.
starting the university into the bake-off fever, if you fight at someone's door to make knowledge and take a denial farrage, it seems less strange, less like the situation in the 50s,' welcome to the neighbourhood, i cooked something, i is now smiling and i ask personal questions'.
home-prepared wonderful are a great way of making you friends.
tacolosns will feel forced to stand and end up linking your figure with a gustoy surprise.
obviously you have to be a good cook.
comns of flour, sugar and the fat are most likely to lead others to pretend to sleep when you on the door.
food theft is a common crime in student homes.
obviously, if you're throwing someone's plates is theft theft but if you take a drop of milk to lying to tea is also theft?
ask the owner.
you will probably tell you even if you boiling inside.
if someone steals things, it is annoying and i understand you - still try to address the more mature problem than my colleague of camin, who coloured his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who have stolen.
now he is in prison.
do not make noise that does not let others sleep or study.
this is not only because it is of common sense, but because you go to your own on the pieces.
a pallim girl with me asked her neighbour to give music more slowly because it was 3 am and had an exam in the morning.
their reaction was to give music stronger.
when they finally stopped music at 5am, the girl was amable and let them sleep two hours before giving the maximum way to music, incubed the door and left the three-hour exam.
would it not be romantic if the future husband / future wife moved lightly?
on the contrary, would it not be extremely strange if you confuse a pallim colleague with your future husband, a couple couple, have broken up and you should meet on daily day, and perhaps even see him how all your common friends are like?
of course, you cannot resist you - but if a pallim sex colleague is certainly not your future husband, it is even trying to be rational.
at the exciting moment you realise that someone left their keys to the open room, the line between farce and intimidation is better than it seems.
a successful farce is funny, but it can distort in a few moments.
hand over a funny and valuable safety lesson by hiding something - but you never tear down the house of someone with a toothth and sampon.
lock the door and put the keys to a glass of water that you turn to freezing - but do not lack someone's goods of tavan more than twice.
violonist david grimal: there were no world tournaments in the era of bach.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people working, artists and not trade representatives.
french violonist david grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a list but as an initiator of a less ordinary project, truly' strange', as he himself says, les dissonances - an orchestra consisting of international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a symphtoire without having a conductor, and that makes a classic landscape.
les dissonances was this year at enescu festival with two performances: a performance sunday, where solist was david grimal, founder of the orchestra, and one monday, was violcelist xavier phillips ps, the work made by enescu nelipsite.
both performances on the athens scene showed another way to interpret classical music.
les dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004, at the time, the only classic musical whole in which there is no conductor.
the conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
it is true, on the one hand need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - i am talking about instrumentatives and not composers.
they are trained as' specialised workers'.
they themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.
on the other side of the scene, for the public, all musical coverage focuses on conductor.
and thus, the businesswoman, the music industry, is doing marketing.
therefore, we are no longer talking about music.
so, if we look at this world, we have qualified workers on hand, which is stupid stupid, and a public that cannot listen, but they have to look at, and that is stupid, " david david grimal.
violonist says the change in the way music music follows his solist career " musical deceptions. "
i was like a high-level athlete to exercise the same exercise throughout the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money to the music industry.
10 years ago, when i was around 30 years ago, i found this very depressing, because we did no longer find human creativity and fraternity in this system.
therefore, we have no longer found any point in continuing along this path.
in this way i have decided to create les dissonances.
this was the case in 2004, and at the time, no one was doing so without a conductor:' the extremely conservative, conservative music world, did not want such projects'.
" how do you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians no longer ego? " the artist asks.
david grimal acknowledges that les dissonaces is " a luxury, " pointing out that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
in 10 years of the ensembles, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a barrier in the musical act: " courcuriously, the more we weigh a more complex repertoire, the more simple, because all musicians are forced to be present in opera and not just in role, " grimal argues, adding at sunday's performance we were 74 conductors on sunday's performance. "
in grimal's grimal, the enescu festival is a " very courageous " one, precisely because it also invited les dissonances:: " an extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras in the world are present to sing and 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestorchestras also invited this strange group as well. "
in a temple of orchestrated tradition, such as the enescu festival, there is a place and interest in something different, which breaks barriers.
speaking about enescu's opera, the violonist acknowledges he feels romanian music of the famous romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when introducing enescu works into his repertoire.
grimal notes that enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is when we speak to george enescu and romanian music, " because there is also a george enescu who has the french music. "
grimal is campaigning for changing the way classical musical education is done, believing that " the musician profession, as it is organised today, has a death voiz, " and that " the future of music represents the music itself. "
we do not need to make the world tour 5 times a year if it does not serve anything.
in the bach era there were no world tours.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people who were artists and not trade representatives.
for me, organising concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albualbum, they are all formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are in the service of music.
if not, we are in a system in which creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
to illustrate this phenomenon, david grimal set an example to romanian products before and after accession to the european union: " in romania, before you enter the eu, you had vegetables and good meat. "
to enter the eu, you have had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
production and agriculture reach the service of supermarkets, as is in france.
the same thing happens with music, it is the same logic.
les dissonances makes red oes perhaps not too beautiful but when we cut them are real tomatoes.
in an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can start with education policy.
" if we thought -- as koreans, chinese chinese, japanese -- that western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce his school learning, we would introduce concerts on television and this education there would no longer need to sell musical by-products, " grimal believes.
there are certainly things in classical musical education that remains very communist, everywhere, is something very militarised.
whether we compare a musician with a soldier depends on this discipline or whether we form a musician who will perform at an instrument and, above all, musician.
this is completely different education if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) it must be somehow if we want to form a musician, it is entirely different.
in your opinion, what is more dangerous, is a soldier or a musician? " asks the french artist zsmiling.
grimal shows that for artists, a reward for another kind of making music comes precisely from overcoming this status of' soldier', going beyond what' they believe are their limits':' the musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and that is why they come are out'.
david grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist in the " festival of ideas, " a discussion with the public at the george enescu international festival by the aspen romania institute.

cinema city seeks " small big voices "
cinema city launches the toughest challenge for children: the doubling of two superproduction figures cracks " 3d snow. "
do you have a super-talented and spontaneeous child, who you like the films?
it gives him a chance.
in september, during the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, willing to reach future stars and are between 8 and 16, cinema city looks for " small big voices, " by giving them an extraordinary opportunity to double two figures in a famous animation film.
if the emphasis was placed in classical drawings on bringing the voice of the actor to the specificity of the animated character, stories are being considered in recent times and those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually well known actors.
cinema city romania, however, wants to discover new voices, which is why we are launching an unprecedented campaign.
we want to find the right voice and challenge parents to roll their children in our contest.
they will have special experience, because characters are sympathatic and replications are fun.
" the children will get fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors, " said ioana ionescu, marketing manager of cinema city romania.
in the first competition stage, from september 11th to september 30th, cinema city holds a shortpressure for 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to perform in a recording studio with professionals.
all parents have to do is access micilecimari.cinema-city.ro platform where to enter the child in the contest and prepare it for the voice test.
subsequently, they must choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts the child is to read and then the child will register by performing its own version of duplication.
four films about friendship, basque o heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support evidence: " pene galbene 3d, " " mune: guardian of 3d, " " blinky bill: koala cel poznas 3d, " and " albinuta maya 3d. "
finally, the two children (one girl and boy) will see their fai dream and each double a figure from the snow snow queen -- facing snow 3d snow, its premiere in romania in november this year.
fedex gains mixed, fiscal forecasts for 2016
fedex declared disappointing results for the last quarter, with the supply giant reducing profit estimates for the whole year as a result of low demand for transport services and the increased costs for its land transport division.
the company also said it plans to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
during the same period, fedex announced he would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
the company shares dropped by about 2.5 per cent in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of the opening bell on wednesday.
fedex corp. said she expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in may next year, with 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimate.
analysts expected $10.84, according to a factset poll.
the decreasing estimate comes despite rising prices of 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 january and the higher overcharge for land transport of large or high-weight packages, which will be applied since november.
the company said it still expects increased gains from the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
president and director general fred smith said " the firm faces a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially as regards global production and trade. "
plans for plans during the holidays were announced a day after the ups ups tor said it plans to employ 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of employment that it did last year.
in the quarter on august 31st, fedex won $692m, 6% more than the previous year.
gains per share were $2.42, below the average of $2.44 per share by 12 analysts responding to the zacks investment research survey.
the profits increased by 5 per cent, up to $12.3 billion.
six analysts attending the zacks's $12.23 billion survey.
fedex has been hit by a decline in international priority transport in recent years, leading to a stagnation in revenues from its unit express.
but explosion in online shopping paid the results of the fedex ground division.
in the last quarter, the revenues of the ground division increased by 29%, but operational revenues basically stalled stalled due to higher costs for large packages and their own insurance.
unit express registered an increase in revenue due to higher basic tariffs, while revenues from the freight division have decreased due to rising costs.
at the pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, fedex shares had dropped by $3.85 or 2.5%, to $150.15.
on tuesday, it fell by 11 per cent year-on-year and 17 per cent from the record peak on 11 june.
at the most expected meeting in the last few years, policy policymakers at the federal reserve will spend two days this week around a table of mahan an by 27 legs to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
above them, at an end of the central bank meeting, a mural picture of the united states will be presented.
the map aims to recall that janet l. yellen, president of the edf, and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all.
the central bank received a twofold task from congress: to maximise the employment rate in the us and to maintain price stability.
but since the big economic crisis, the edf leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
and this third task could be the factor x in decision too difficult to predict, which will be announced on tuesday and which will determine whether the us economy is ready to be disappointed by the unprecedented stimulus offered by the almost zero short-term interest rate in force since the end of 2008.
even though the majority of data points to a sharply growing economy, the recent turmoil val in the global financial markets could frighm the edf officials are already wary of adding the volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - albeit only by a quarter of a percentage point.
" obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will follow, " said lindsey m. piegza, chief economist at brokeraj stifel nicolaus & co.
" but i think that if they sought an excuse not to increase interest rates, rising uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait, " she said.
there is no consensus on the decision that the edf will take, in itself causing financial market instability.
about half of the economists recently questioned by bloomberg predicted an increase in the interest rate this week.
however, the financial markets expect the edf to postpone, with a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
that would indicate a drop on the stock exchange if the edf increases the interest rate, unless policypolicymakers water down the blow by promising to take a long time until the next growth.
on tuesday, dow jones industrial media moved up 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16.599.85.
the momentum was triggered by expectations that the edf decision makers will maintain the stable interest rate this week, said john lonski, chief economist at moody's capital markets research group.
" it would be surprising for the edf to increase the interest rate at this moment, " lonski said.
if edf decision makers were to do so,' they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets'.
other experts have said that an interest rate increase would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the edf works.
just a month ago, the edf appeared about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the force of us recovery.
yellen said in the spring and earlier this summer that he expected an increase in the interest rate this year despite objections raised by liberals such as more economic progress was needed.
although job creation slowed in august, labour market growth was strong this year.
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the edf as full employment.
the wage gains have shown signs of growth.
and although inflation continued not to meet the central bank's annual goal, the edf decision-makers said that a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply-windling oil prices.
the economy " can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tension in the labour market, " said ian shepherdson, chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics.
but the global financial markets began entering fibrilates at the end of this month after china devalued its currency.
dow jones dow dow jones dropped by 16% below the record maximum achieved in may, as investors feared that the slowing down of the chinese economy would sk down world growth.
the market's silence somewhat this month, with the dow index now at about 10% below the may maximum.
for edf decision makers, the turmoil in the market is added to the complex calculation of when the interest rate is raised.
" without what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakening of the chinese economy in recent weeks it would be more firm at the sitting, " said stephen d. oliner, experienced researcher at ucla ziman center for real estate and a former edf edf.
now he expects to wait at least a month to manage effects better.
" there is a lot of uncertainty where the impact is on the us economy and they almost have no data based on the events in china, " oliner said.
the well-being of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the edf, so practically should not be considered in decision making.
but in reality, the edf has become global monetary authority.
in recent years, the central bank's influence has been huge.
the mere illusion of then president ben s. s. bernanke in 2013, that the edf could'' narrow' its monetary expansion has triggered the earthquake in the global markets.
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly emanapart, edf officials are expected not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to better interpret the world economy.
his decision-making process is " more art than science, " said zachary karabell, the head of the global strategy department at the welfare management firm envestnet inc.
jeffrey lacker, the federal reserve bank president of richmond, va, said this month that " the edf has an oversized response record to changes in the financial market that seem not related to do with economic bases. "
lacker, a voting member of the federal open market commission, a decision-making body, which supported the interest rate increase, provided the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
a financial crisis that has affected asia led the edf to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, " despite implications with a limited identification possibility for us development, " lacker said.
a year later, edf officials returned to maturity.
the edf should put financial stability first in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said adam adam s. posen, a former interest rate commission member at the bank of england.
the last turbulent period is nowhere near that, he said.
" we certainly do not want to get in a position to fear of an interest rate increase because they have upset the markets, " said posen, president peterson institute for international economics.
the federal reserve act still holds a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes, i do not believe that it should take premature measures.

4 lost their lives after police fired with rubber bullets in the protesters in nepal
four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern nepal after police fired rubber bullets ets in a crowd demonstrating against the country's new proposed constitution, an official said on wednesday.
the violence occurred tuesday evening in the rupandehi district, about 80km west of kathathmandu.
according to bishnu prasad dhakal, district police chief, over 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station, and some threw stones and molotov cocktails.
mr. dhakal said the police forces used tear gas before firing fire into the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, according to him.
it was not clear immediately why rubber ber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
the clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in nepal's southern region, where members of the madhehesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would weaken their political influence.
protests have also existed in the west of nepal, where the tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
at least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes on august 10th,
when four key political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces - a major step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in nepal, which has been ally governed for hundreds of years.

weight-cutting surgery could be useful for obesity diabetics
the benefits of cutting weight for light obesity people with type-2 diabet sugar could remain for at least five years, according to a new study.
it is still premature to say whether easy obesity diabetites live more after weight loss surage intervention than those who follow nechirurgical treatments.
" it is long needed to centralise mortality data, " said obesity surgery specialist dr. robin blackstone, car she wrote an article on the new study in jama surgery.
operations for weight loss, names and surgeons of barrier barrier, are using different methods to reduce the dental.
they reduce the sense of hunger and limit the capacity of the body to absorb food.
over the years, barrier barrier ric surgery has proved effective in the treatment of type 2 sugar diabet, but most studies went on morbida obesity people with a 35 or higher, corporate table index (imc).
the imc, a unit of weight measure in relation to justice, is considered normal within the range of 18.5-24.9.
the imc value of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and imc people over 30 are considered obese.
you can calculate your imc: 1.usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
for the new study, researchers at taiwan's min-sheng general hospital used the data gathered up after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of of baribarrier ical surgery - bypass gastric, and gastrectomie in manson - in the medical treatment of the type 2 sugar diabet to light obesity people.
the average imc to people who suffered surgical intervention dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the survey.
meanwhile, the imc to people who received nechirurgical treatment against the sugar diabetet remained close to the same level, namely 29.
of those suffering surical intervention, sugar diabetet sold sold to 36 per cent and partly to 28 per cent.
in the treaty group through medical methods, by comparison, sugar diabetet has sold completely to only 1 per cent and partly to only 2% of the subjects.
furthermore, control of terrible tension, trigliceridees and " bad cholesterol were generally better in the surgical group, " the authors concluded.
the researchers also monitored the sanguin level of the a1c globe, which reflects the level of gemia over time.
researchers write that the optimal level of the a1c globe is below 7%.
after surical intervention, the average level of a1c hemous dropped from around 9% to about 6%.
but in the treaty group through medical methods, it stood at around 8%.
but this improved glicemic control " -- reflected by the improved levels of the a1c globe -- have not reduced the mortality rate to five years, according to chief researcher dr. chih-chencheng hsu and colleagues.
the research team has also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
in the fifth year, compared to the gastrectomie group in manson, the surgical group lost more in weight (18.7 compared to 14.2 kg), registered higher falls in imc value (7.4 compared to 5.1) and ha11c (3.1 1 from 2.1%) and 6.7%.
although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgeons after five years, there is evidence from a study by heavy people in sweden that surgical intervention extends life, says blackstone, of arizona university, the faculty of medicine - phoenix.
in the swedish study, obespeople who suffered sursurgery of the barrier barrier showed about 29% less to die after 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit to patients who suffered surical intervention, blackstone said it was an optimistic issue for imc under 35 interested in the procedure.
" this is the point where this work is critical, because it says this surical intervention is safe in the lower imc group, " without increasing the risk of death or renrent disease, she says.
blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start -taking weight seriously then the patient's imc reaches 27-30.
" i think we wait too long to urge people to take this seriously, " she said.
i believe that having accumulated these genetic changes that have shortened their bodies by placing them to obesity and diabet, it is extremely difficult for them to return to normal.
" it is impossible to come to europe " -- the dalai lama -- the rt news
europe could not receive all refugees, the dalai lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the middle east.
the tibetan buddhist leader sent an appeal to end violence in the mother countries of refugees.
the dalai lama spoke about the current problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the dalai lama centre for compassion oxford centre, dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to great britain.
he said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even every continent.
he also stressed that while admirable, the response of the western european countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
" it is impossible to come to europe, " he said in his speech.
although the dalai lama has praised germany and austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
" it is wonderful care for several thousand refugees, but we must also think about long-term solutions in order to bring sincere peace and development, especially through education, to muslim countries, " he stressed.
after all, we need to think about ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
we must reduce the use of force.
the force has never solved these problems, " he added.
on the issue of violence, the dalai lama also commented on george bush's actions after the 11 september terrorist attacks, saying the violent response from the us generated a chain of unmanagable events.
after the events of 11 september, we expressed our condolences in a letter to president bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
i know his motives were strong but used force and generated unexpected consequences, " the dalai lama said.
four-fold increase in the number of children who have sought detergent hands over the past 4 years.
according to georgia's anti-poisvire centre, the us anti-poisoning centres have reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 as regards the number of children under the age of 12 who have allowed wed detergent hands with high alcohol content.
according to dr gaylord lopez, director of georgia's anti-otravire centre, cases of children-12-year-old detergents at anti-opoisoning centres rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
" children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them reach the emergency chamber, " lopez told cnn.
lopez said some children had intentionally detergent, and others do so to impress their friends to respond to challenges on social media.
movies can be watched on youtube showing teenagers like drinking detergent to create cheap beages.
teenagers are said to have mixed up alcohol-ath-water detergents to get a stronger drink.
smaller children can be drawn to the attractive smell of detergents.
" a child does not think that he is doing harm to them, " lopez says.
many of the most attractive types (of detergent hands) are smoked.
capberary detergents, strugure, strugure, steal are the most attractive to children.
hand detergents contain about 45-95% of alcohol.
especially small children, only a few swallow can cause alcohol poisoning.
" it is very focused alcohol, " dr stephen thornton, medical director of the anti-otravire centre at the kansas university hospital, told the fox 4 channel in kansas city.
thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whwhiskey on the table, but people leave these detergents in affordable places and if the small ones reach them, this is a quick way of consuming much alcohol.
a six-year-old nhahaijah russell who recently sought the equivalent of four sprasions with capwwean detergent, reached the emergency chamber to receive treatment.
he had alcohol emia179, twice the threshold an adult is considered under alcohol, according to dr chris ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated it at the gwinnett centre outside atlanta.
nhaijah balmajea and could not go when she arrived in the emergency chamber.
doctors monitored it overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage because the girl fell and hit head due to alcohol, ritchey said.
" it was frightening, " ortoria scott, mother of nhaijah, told cnn.
it could have been fatal.
lopez urged parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or products or serv, and not to leave their hands-hand detergents to children.
in addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
in 2013, two ontario women died after freezing detergent hands containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
health authorities alleged the product contained metthanol, a lethal substance and not alcohol, which was specified as an active ingredient.
in january, three fourth-class students in new york plotted to poison their professor " bad " putting antibacterial products in class, " according to a police report.
she is very allergic in detergent hands and banned him in his training room.

why witness execution in oklahoma
later today, apart from a late legal intervention, i will look at how a man to death is sentenced.
if so, and i hope not happen, i will stand in a room for observers in the oklahoma prison prison execution room and see how richard glossip is executed by administration of the latvian injection.
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
the invitation first came in january, by means of his best friend, and, although i was shocked, i accepted.
as the day approaches, i am appalled at the idea.
so why?
i agreed because i thought that it was a good way of tell the whole story of capital punishment.
it would be unique.
it is true, journalists can witness executions executions in america and, because applications usually exceed the number of places available, a macabra lottery is taking place to decide who will be elected.
oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
those elected will look impartially at execution.
i cannot.
i would stand alongside richard glossip's closest friends, moreover, i have developed my own link with him over the months of telephone conversations and a half-hour visit.
i like.
we often break a great deal when we are talking.
prison authorities say i cannot be a witness and journalist, so i will not be allowed to have a net and a pix to me to note what i see.
i will have to try to recall all the details.
a journalist from oklahoma accused twitter of compromising my impartiality.
the lesson.
it tells the ownership story as it wants, it gets access.
i complained.
he acknowledged that' he could have formula better', but he still says i am wrong.
richard glossip disagreed with some of the things i have said and written.
he does not tell me what to write and i would not do so if he asked me.
i have told him that he can remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
but it wants an international report writing on the subject to be present.
it believes that if it dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
kim ffington post, reporter reporter kim bellware will be with me.
if you want to find out more about the case, you listen to the series of multimedia files that we have made.
i will not come back here to all the details.
i cannot say with certainty that richard glossip is innocent.
his actions after barry van treese are guilty of complicity.
but i think it is very likely not to be guilty of murder.
i certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
i think his execution is wrong.
and i will look at him dying from this perspective.
i cannot pretend that they are totally objective.
for this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
from me, you will find out how it is to watch a man that you like by dying needlessly.
peter moody claims stewarguard tried to spy, threatens to withdraw from race
peter moody said stewarguard racing his victory sought to infiltrate a spy into his walls last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from races.
he launched an attack against stewarmen and the integrity department racracing victoria, saying they run a personal campaign against him, a drop that filled the glass being lady tatai's removal from the race due to treatment administered on race day.
moody told fairfax media that it has always tried to do what is best for flights and that it is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome of lidari's cobalt test, for which it has no explanation.
for 18 months he swallowed his words about statements about spies, and did not want to look like the' volcano that does not reach grapes'.
" i was not going to say anything about that issue and i quiet for a long time but sometimes reach such a level of frustration that everything bursts up at a sudden, " moody said.
it is known to have continued.
sometimes reactionary and you have to suffer the consequences and i will have to live with what i said.
i will go home and i will sleep ease.
i want to go with my head high, and i want the owners whom i am working to see that i strive to give them all the best.
since they start to believe that this is not the case, i have to give up the trainer profession.
i will then have to consider what i will do with my certification.
earlier, moody threw the bomb in an interview with racing.com saying the integrity department had tried to spy on its walls.
" eighteen months ago, terry bailey, the dayle brown and dr brian stewart stood standing in a room with a man -- whose name i will say if i am asked -- and they offered to commit him to my maps to provide information about the work there, " told moody racing.com.
obviously, it considers me to be a trisor.
if that is so, then they should all step down because they were incompetent in an attempt to catch me.
robert roulston, former rvl president david moodie, current president of rvl and bernard saundry, current executive director of rvl, knew at the time and i also know today.
should i think that this is something personal?
is it necessary for the rvl to start having the backbone and can hold people from outside trainers accountable for what is happening in the industry?
do i have a bad influence on the industry?
so bad is my influence on industry?
perhaps that is how i see others.
perhaps i have to take my license and give me aside, and i have no doubts that the statements i am making now could lead them to think about it.
but i reached the point where i no longer care, and that really saddens me.
i am very saddened.
i will put pressure and make them make a decision.
my family is standing up for me and i can leave.
the living's frustration grew with the long investigation into cobalt testing involving liders and the elimination led him to say that he could " put his license on the table. "
moody, whose name is most associated with training undefeated champion black caviar, labelled the race day treatment rule as " ridiculous " after applying on the leg of a namol or argargon its feet, thereby violating the rules.
it is violating the rules of flights.
i have to take full responsibility for this, " he says.
one of my employees put them namol on the foot.
it could have happened last night.
it could have happened yesterday, which happened.
it happened on the day of the race.
moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment on the day of cataplma enforcement, for which stewarguard opened an investigation.
a joke.
people who make these rules do not know anything about horses.
" we all understand that rules are needed, but it went too far, " moody said.
driver who hit, fled accident in cobram arrested
police arrested a man after a collision with a bram bike at the weekend and followed by the flight from the accident.
the cyclwas transported by helicopter to royal melbourne hospital, seriously injured after a car on the murray valley highway saturday morning.
police representatives say the driver of the car did not stop to help the injured bicclike.
on monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to police in shepparton.
he is said to be accused of fleeing from the site of the accident, failing to provide the first help and other road crimes.
the cyclist, a 40-year-old man from cobram, remains internalised stable.
coach melbourne storm craig bellamy responds to opponents in wrestling charges.
coach melbourne storm, craig bellamy, called criticism of his team's car tactics as " distorted topics " brought up by the nrl's two main favourites.
sydney coach roosters, trent robinson, said referees allowed storm players to " storm them, " the team in the nervovos storm storm in friday qualifying finals in sydney.
brisbane broncos coach wayne bennett made a slight reference to storm following his team's victory with north queensland cowboys late saturday when he called the rugby league " demonstration " and said the two queensland teams were little due to wrestling.
bellamy jumped in defence of the liked tactics his team team addressed and said the players simply focused on " contact " when they liked.
bellamy says he gained confidence after two coaches criticised his team, meaning they were worried that storm would beat them.
" and things don't stop here -- i didn't hear trent robinson to complain wrestling when they beat us 24-2 " bellamy said on wednesday.
i can guarantee that we have changed everything year in our defensive systems or techniques, so only as in the last six weeks we have really emphasis on contact in placements and thus changed the situation.
trent has been in office for three years and it obviously has a wonderful team so it is probably not used to losing and was a shock to him.
we know how it is always happening during this period of the year.
bellamy countered bennett's idea of " animating football, " recalling bennett's mentor george-illawarra dragons won the championship in 2010 playing " boring " football.
wayne talks about exciting football.
he argued his opinion by comparing his game saturday evening with our game friday evening and spoke about how exciting the game was, " bellamy said.
i remember that in 2010, st george received much criticism for being a boring team and wayne said he did not interest him either under the dark.
but now it has a team that can play what we would see as exciting football, especially because of abducapped young midfielders.
this kind of game you want to do it when you have such players.
he brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt its playing style -- not any team has two midfielders like anthony milford and ben hunt to be able to do so.
it gives me more confidence because they say this things because they are somewhat concerned about the match with us.
six weeks ago they were probably not thinking of us when they thought about important matches.
bellamy also emphasised that the storm and roosters match was a harsher draw compared to the match between broncos and cowboys.
the bronze cos match was probably a good match, have we not yet seen it score 16-12?
our match ended up 20-18, were there two attempts in our game, does that mean a tremendous game?
or does palpitant mean making breaks and not marching?
there are plans for me.
if i talk about us, it means that we could meet them at some point.
storm free this weekend for winning the right to play home either with north queensland cowboys or cronulla sharks in the preliminary finals next saturday in aami park with tickets on sale on sale next tuesday.
stevan hogg used the fetif phone to help paedophiles to send images.
a paedophile was using an 11-year-old phone to demand images of abused children.
stevan hogg took the girl's phone when her sleep then authentified in an online messaging service where another user sent him a number of indecent images with children as a subject.
the girl later found up and observed the disappearance of the phone, which he found in hand of hogg, while he wanted.
he looked over the phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted his mother.
after arrival, police saw the five pictures then looked at the computers found at the address and found " worrying " searches on the internet using terms to find some indecent images of child subjects.
hogg claimed he did so to " attract paedophiles " to the internet before " claiming to be a police officer to frighten them. "
eilidh robertson told the danube court: " said it is dependent -- that it is dependent on frighing people.
he acknowledged he made computer searches, but said he did so because he wanted to give himself a policeman to frighten paedophiles.
he was asked about conversations conversations with the unknown person who sent him his images and the fact that he had asked the person to send him other pictures as well.
he said she did so.
he said he was no longer considering when the drink and that he wants to see images of rape and murders.
mr robertson added:' when the girl found messages on the phone, his mother and pascried and complaining.
the girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was faced.

mr mugabe, the oldest african leader, fell on a podium at the beginning of the year.
but the filming was not injured has become viral on social media.
the opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by the representatives of the opposition who said that they had received anonymous death threats, threatening to somehow hule mr mugabe during his speech.

hewlett-packard to make 30,000
hewlett-packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 redundancies as part of the company's restructuring and cost reduction efforts in the services sector.
this year, the hp will split on the stock exchange in two companies, separating the computer division and manh from operations with corporate hardware and fulning services.
the expected layoffs will cost about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, the hp said.
" this restructuring will bring the new hewlett packard enterprise with a more competitive and cost-sustainable structure, " said memeg whitman, the president and director of hhp, who will lead unity after the split.
" hewlett packard enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the hp at present and will have a broad business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of firms to the new style of business, " whitman said.
operating as a separate society, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
according to a company statement, hewlett packard enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and " focus on providing unrival integrated solutions " to companies.

friendsfest: the comedy series that has taught us important lessons about male friendship
the absence of similar figures in the series is obvious, since the need for men is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching the past 15 years.
in 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in britain aged 20-45, and remains three times more male than women.
in an attempt to address the problem, the campaign against unfortunate life (campaign against living miserably (calm) designated 2015 as the year of the man, wishing to call into question the culture that prevents men from asking for help in need.
friendship is at the heart of the fight towards this challenge's success.
a recent study of over 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by many friends " with a healthy state of mood, " his chances for recovery doubles.
similarly, for people who are not pressed, a circle of mental healthy friends halhalves half the problikelihood of mental disorders.
of course, in order for friendship to have an effect, it must, above all, be accessible.
in this era of the communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is on style and not on substance, the immediate character of the response often takes priority prior to meaningful contact.
our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong figure who is open to fun and success, even though in reality it is isolation isolation that prevails.
this very superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsecary values; money, image, social status all at the cost of intrinsic values - our internal desire for personal development and friendship - which even more deeply affect our mental health.
the bilbilaire inventor of a video game recently explained that the money really does not buy happiness.
serious friends' beauty has been that it has focused attention to this idea.
characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, whom they showed by interacting as friends.
joey and chandler's frequent humour, the time when they look at football in the comfortable comashes and passion for ross came from the fact that it is known that men men can associate themselves with this situation, even though they often continue to completely exploexplore their feelings.
as a social worker explained to me:'... my role in listening to people with the trend of suicide and depressed has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference'.
often, the people who appeal to us do not feel able to speak with friends.
his old adadage alone is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
friends is one of the series coming to mind when i try to offer more long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
the series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
however much it helps objective, outside intervention, via telephone, the people arrived in times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
thus, if you attend this weekend in friendsfest organised by central comedy edy with the complete offices of fills to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in central perk.
or even better, if you see someone alone in starbucbucks, smiled and greute.
you never know what difference your friendship could make.
friends are being aired by the central comedy from the beginning to the end -- all 236 episodes -- at # friendsfest.
di maria marks, helps the bsp set malmo aside
angel di maria celebrates with blaise matuidi and edinson cavani after marking against malmo.
angel di maria marked her debut match in the champions league on tuesday and helped the bsp pull ahead of swedish's malmo.
we next present you chronic to the match and the reaction at stake.
angel di maria and edinson cavani did their job, paris saint-germain starting the match series in the champions league group, with a reassuring 2-0 victory against malmo in a match on the des prprpark on tuesday.
di maria marked less than four minutes after her bsp champions league debut match kicked off, bringing the french champions to an advantage, although they missed a number of opportunities before securing their advantage with the knight's goal in the 61st minute.
reaching group a with real madrid and sahtior donetk paris needed a strong start against the swedish champions because the french team's objective is not only qualifying for optimi but also an improvement in the quarterfinal course in each of the last three tours.
but while taking the points, laurent blanc's students were far from a perfect picture with zlatan ibrahimovic who wasted the goal opportunity then replaced by his hometown and the club starting his brilliant career in 1999.
" it is not easy to win at home or travel to the champions league, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents, and sets a comfortable difference from the next ahead of the next rankings, even though there are still issues that we need to improve over the course of the season, " blanc says.
it is a good sign of this.
we wanted to win and we did so, although i am sorry that we have not managed to give one or two more goals.
ibrahimovic returned after injured one of the three changes to the paris team, with a 2-2 stake home by bordeaux in league 1 at the weekend, but by di maria took light on the spotlight in the fourth minute.
when transferred from manchester united united last month, argentinian offensive midfielder was named the man who will lead the bsp to the next level in europe and he demonstrated this when he dared to the marco verratti's care behind malmo's defence before he droan incredible incredible over johan wiland, in the long corner on the right of gate.
but if someone expected the bsp to win victory flowing from their fingers, they were disappointed.
malmo, who beat celtic in the play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine holders at national teams, with a defence from five people and two defensive midfielders, was a strong challengsary.
but their attack was not impressive, the exception with the submission of nikola djurdjic who passed kevin trapp's post in the 34th minute.
instead, bsp players slowed the pace several times, giving some unnecessary passes and not finish intervention, even ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts in the first half alone and then replaced by cavyears even after the game resumed.
ibrahimovic, however, proved much better skilled in supporting his colleagues, with the care that di maria sent to a sut deviated by willacross gate in the 52nd minute.
the second goal was eventually scored after an hour was dawn from the match, thanks to cavani, uruguayan who scored the sixth season goal after ibrahimovic passed from the belation of maxwell.
that goal removed malmo's hope that they will rebalance the score and only a superstop by wiland from a distance to reject david luiz kept the final score before new entry equiel lavezzi cancelhim a goal in extensions.
the norwegian team coach in malmo, age hareide, later said that the bsp was a fish and that " the last game we played in the champions league was in december last year. "
since then, we have only played in the swedish league, which does not amount to the same level.
qualifications are insufficient.
below the palace for the bsp.
they have been playing an excellent game.

the government approved, on wednesday, the " national immigration strategy for the period 2015-2018 " and the the year's action plan, " documents considered to be " another stage that romania is taking as part of efforts to modernise the immigration management process within national territory, " according to a press release.
the source cited shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and courses of action that reflect policies established at european level, adapted to national realities.
given the problems faced by the immediate neighbours of romania, measures are being considered for unified and consistent management of situations arising from the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants into romanian territory, resulting from situations of political, social, economic or military crisis.
" the romanian authorities will help create a flexible admission system, but, at the same time, will pay particular attention to citizens coming from countries with potential migrmigration or who can harm national security, " the aforementioned source adds.
the strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including the maintenance of the conflict situation in syria, the reactivation of the conflict in iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the surrounding areas of romania (ukraine, transnistria), the perpetuation and increasing increase in the israeli-palestinian armed conflict.
on the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic immigration objectives, such as: promoting legal migration, tighter controls on the residence of third-country nationals in romania and proper application of distant measures and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
the national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of general strategic objectives.
these include: facilitating access to the territory of third citizens who meet employment needs, favouring third-country citizens access to higher education institutions in romania for the areas and professions identified as a weakness.
with regard to the 2015 action plan, the government appreciates it as' a means of establishing concrete activities that lead to the creation of a more flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon'.

tvr management activity report, rejected in committees: stelian tanhad risks dismissal
parliament's culture committees wednesday rejected an activity report by the romanian television society's board of directors for 2014.
17 voted to reject the report, one against the rejection (senator varujan vosganian) and one abstained.
the report's text will be submitted to the joint permanent offices.
they are expected to decide next week.
the next joint plenary will be discussed.
" i think that in the light of this situation will be done relatively quickly, " the chairman of the senate culture committee, georgica severin said.
he added that " it was of common sense " for the tvr leadership to be present at this meeting, as no representative of the tvr leadership was present at the meeting of culture committees.
it was of common sense that tvr leadership was present because nobody here was subjected to personal attacks or something like.
the invitation was made to members as last night, with an approximate hour that we did not know new, but today, after the meeting of joint offices, i personally sent a fax to tvr leadership inviting it.
i believe that when you are convened, you are a budget wage, paid from public taxes and are called to a joint committee meeting even if you do not like alive.
" because it is your duty, you are in an institution subordinate to parliament, " severin said after a meeting of parliament's joint culture committee.
he added that financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the budget committees.
the debts also saw us as they continued, came with the idea that this year would have been daily, but were not paid from the historical ones.
" i remind you that not because of my fault or anyone else in these committees, that aggression was lost with the banks and with taxation, there are clear management problems, " severin said.
he added that after the activity report is rejected by the joint plenary elections will be held for a new board of board, and it would elect the institution's director-general.
i do not know who will be proposed for this.
wonders will not be done.
it is important for political decisions for this institution to function.
i am not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a great genius will appear in the queue here and knocking.
i hope that those who decide, parliament's plenary, through their vote will very sensibly choose the people who will head tvr.
there must be people who know what is happening there, have experience and have a great deal of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
i do not know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities do they have to have - common sense in their attitude to the employees because it is a malage of petitions coming from employees, complaints, complaints, redundancy.
" when you get such complaints 50, 60, 70, something rotten and the financial situation that is a disaster, " concluded the chairman of senate senate senate culture committee.
while failing to appear in parliament, tvr president-general stelian tanase sent a letter to the president of the chamber of deputies, valeriu zgonea, urging parliament to consider a number of measures that could save and guarantee economic and political independence of public television, including indexation of tv tax.
in the letter, stelian tanase calls, apart from indexing the tv tax, amending and supplementing hg 978 / 2003 on the public service tax, in order to update provisions at the level of technological changes every day, and for regulating the control procedure for the payment of tv tax and the finding of offences and the application of sanctions and penalties.
he also wants a provision to be issued providing for an extension of the obligation for all power suppliers to become srtv mandates for the collection of the tv tax, through anre involvement in regulating this activity.
in his opinion, it is necessary to set a maximum 5% ceiling on the commission from charge.
stelian tanase urges reducing the vat rate for activities specific to the public broadcaster and contribution to the cnc from 15% to 3%, but also amending law 41 / 1994, to receive budget / financing allocations for purchasing licenses for major cultural and sports events -- the world football championship, golden begging, eurovision.
he claims that srtv will defaulted in the coming months, given that labour law obliges the employer to the implementation of court judgments, even if they are not final and wage rights are honoured with priority over any other obligation.
the tvr administration has been making constant efforts to slash spending on staff and tv production.
" this has reduced travel and other cost-generating activities, a number of trade contracts have been renegotiated, and tvr news post was shut down in late july, " president tvr's letter said.
young people appreciate that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied by means of their own efforts alone.
" without the support of state institutions -- the government, parliament, the presidency -- the romanian television will, sooner or later, be unable to carry out its public mission, " the letter noted.
the house of deputies has decided to send the letter to the committee on culture.

i do not want to respond to the challenges posed by some hungarian government representatives.
" they are a disgrace to the eu's culture and values; and in anti-semitic attitudes, and as regards the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis! " ponta added on facebook.
the romanian prime minister added that he supports sensible and sustainable solutions in the event of the refugee crisis, noting that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - just show that in hungary, at the heart of europe, are political decision makers nothing better than those in syria, libya or other countries those refugees are fleeing!
" i believe in solidarity, in sensible and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of european values -- what we see in the last few days in hungary is in complete contradiction with precisely these objectives and values! " the head of the romanian executive stressed.
earlier on tuesday, hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto described as " mere lies " romanian prime minister victor ponta's remarks on hungary's management of the refugee crisis, noting that the asserclaims were inappropriate for a leader in the 21st century, according to mti.
the head of hungarian diplomacy also noted on tuesday that the romanian prime minister's " extremist and offensive remarks " stem from the domestic political crisis in romania and indicated that budapest expects an apology from the romanian side.
szijjarto referred to a statement by prime minister victor ponta monday.
what i have said and always say is that i am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing borders, like all those who come are terrorists, are rubbby the middle ages, and i totally oppose this approach.
if we can get more, we get it, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not as they treat our hungarian neighbours, with bata and seriousness.
" with that i do not agree, " the head of the romanian executive, said at a press conference in targu-jiu.
also tuesday, peter peter szijjarto announced budapest decided to start preparations on the ground for extending the romanian border to the ence it is building on the border with serbia, to deal with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
later, prime minister victor ponta said hungary's decision to raise a border guard does not solve anything of the refugee problem and " take hungary out of europe. "
what link exists between osama bin laden and the collapse of mecca cranes
saudi authorities announced that the saudi giant binladin group, belonging to osama bin laden's family, is " partly responsible " for collapse of a cranes on the grand mosque in mecca on friday, as a result of which 107 people died.
according to an investigative commission, the company has not " complied with the safety rules, " the saudi news agency (spa), the bbc reported.
the company's directors have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation into the case has been completed.
it will also be excluded from new public contracts.
the construction firm is owned by the family of the former leader of the al-qaeda terrorist network, osama bin laden.
the company was founded by osama bin laden's father 80 years ago and is currently led by the brother of the former terrorist leader, bakr.
binladen group has been working to expand large mosques for 4 years to host more pilgrims.
the accident occurred during a storm late friday evening, when a butcher, possibly dispelked by the powerful shelves of wind, crashed on the eastern part of the roof of the big mosque in mecca.
following the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
how haggery closed challenges
considered the biggest romanian football player in history, gica hagi has been labelled after his retirement from his work as a poor coach who cannot be able to perform performance and the new post.
after unfortunate experiences with the national team, his star or galatasaray, hagi assumed the coach role in the constant future a year ago, the team he patrons.
after fixed a year after assuming the team, the king demonstrated that he is capable of turning a team struggling to save from downgragrade to a top one.
thus, a year later, the future registered, with the hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 misstakes and 11 defeats.
the balance is one of a top team on european cups.
things took an even better turn for the future this season, as the team finished second in the league 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader astra giurgiu.
the future also has the best attack in league 1, with 20 goals (on equality with astra), more than double than star.
on the other hand, even though he brought several experienced players, hagi has continued the policy of promoting young people, and names recently in the start team have emerged names such as ianis hagi or hodorogea.
the club's policy made the future a wanted team for the teams abroad, so hagi sold 1.5m euros this summer -- ianis hagi (fiorentina -- about 1m euros) and alexandru mitrita (bari - 500 thousand euros).
alongside the star, the future is the only profitable league 1 team, according to trade registry data.
in the refugee crisis, romania has so far played as a small country.
it is a legitimate strategy, but after that, you cannot ask to be treated as the eu's seventh eu country.
large countries come with solutions for the entire eu, says cristian ghinea, member of the director college of the romanian european policy centre.
in an interview with ziare.com, cristian ghinea showed that europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and purely police means will not work in this crisis: " maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come with. "
but they are nets that have started and we cannot return history.
migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as well as possible and adapt them to us.
in cristian ghinea's view, we are at an extremely emotional time, in which politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
once he passes, the europeans will not be willing to give up freedom of movement, but the rules in the schengen area must be changed:' schengen is now like an animal that has been created in another era and which was not adapted to the situation at the moment'.
where are we in the refugee crisis after this jha council which, in fact, has solved nothing?
it is clear that the ec president in agreement with donald tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
all the forecasts said they would have had the necessary votes.
before the treaty of lisbon, the principle of unanimity is applied in the jha, and any state could block any decision.
that is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
after lisbon, the normal procedure applies, where the ec has initiative, and the council approves it with 55% of states, i.e. 16, accounting represents 65% of the eu's population.
the calculations said that the votes were in place.
but they did not want.
because it is a sensitive issue, reactions have been rerebuement in germany itself against chancellor merkel's opening policy and did not want in many countries to appear as an' eu response sends us migrants per head'.
they have therefore put off, but the problem remains because this wave is obviously creating a huge problem for the governance of schengen and we will probably see big changes there in the coming period.
so mandatory quotas were not really eliminated, but was the subject only being left silent?
yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement by frontex in managing external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are on the external border of schengen to the responsibility of community agencies.
greece's border with turkey is also germany's border with turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has set the limits to the old schengen system.
perhaps the dublin principle will be given up that migrants are the responsibility of the state they they enter the first time, because it is not sustainable.
if greece passes, you cannot say forever that it is greece's job.
the problem is common.
it is precisely because the problem is common, is it possible to be resolved without a precise, perhaps, even binding, mechanism for sharing the effort to be received?
no one knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work, if it comes to them.
because one problem remains: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to romania or portugal, but to sweden or germany?
i do not believe that european states will take the migrants high: you go to the country x or the y country.
it will probably reach single filtering centres, greece or turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
work is being done on solutions such as this.
however, the problem does not have a simple solution.
these are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, are countries with no experience, like romania, where the problem of migrants will increase xenophobic.
the fact is that we are talking millions of people who are in turkey, lebanon, in jordan, who are sitting in precarious camps and who have just begun to europe.
one estimate says that only 10% went to leave, winter is hard to cross the mediterranean, but we expect a perhaps even larger wave next year.
what do we do with them?
my nonsense is that we will get used to this problem, we will no longer regard it as media-catastrophic.
you spoke of countries with less or greater experience.
does it seem to you that there is any place where the integration of large groups from an extra-european culture really succeeded?
i look at the maghreb in france, turks in germany, they are all enclaves.
i would not make radical statements.
of course their integration is more difficult than other migration waves, but this does not mean that they do not integrate at all.
it remains an integrated part that creates major social problems in france, germany, in the uk.
but purely police means will not work.
let us create the fortress of europe is illusory.
it needs to be mowed to the mechanisms for integration into european societies.
there have been some mistakes here.
we must be more demanding.
let us ask these people to learn the language, try to take over values, stop staying on a foot in europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family, including through marriages of convenience.
however, the imminent issue of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
if others have failed in long-term integration does not mean that we must look at them how inherent in the mediterranean.
perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come with.
and if there is an intervention in syria, which i do not think, does not mean that the country will recover overnight and take them back.
until solutions are put in place, we see the fortress within europe.
borders have been closed, walls, border controls are being introduced into the schengen area.
is the european project in jeopardy?
the european project as such does not, the schengen area as built, yes.
it was built rather minimal and arranging the rules, so the pressure was too high on the countries in which these migrants put foot for the first time.
that means we move around there, but everyone is with his problems.
this cannot be the case of such a wave, because some countries are not coping.
when there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show they are doing something but much is not changing in the long term.
after the attacks in france do not have much more draconian anti-terrorist legislation in the eu than we had last year.
it is a wave of public emotion that is installed in both ways.
and it is so unstable from one week to week that you cannot make decisions on the basis of it.
we have a lot of talk, many rebellion statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virals.
and then, you have the dramatic case of the child drowned in turkey, and public opinion is emoemotional.
after public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this area, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
this is the real single market in europe.
and i do not think europeans will give up this libertliberty principle.
that there will be other rules is something else.
schengen is now like an animal created in another era and was not adapted to the current situation.
how has romania played in this crisis so far?
as a small country, which believes that if it sog on the eye and shears its ears, the theme disappears.
faced with the reality of waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it is not a small country.
that is what we have done, it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
you are not, you are not playing at large country level.
large countries come up with solutions for all of the eu, good or bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
poland.
on the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that romanians' appetite for schengen will fall greatly.
president iohannis says it is good that we have not already entered.
we are therefore moving from the despair of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective still remains.
there is, of course, a risk if romania and bulgaria enter schengen that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
this does not mean that it is a reason to stop entering schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
romania will be part of schengen, and schengen will exist, but transformed into the sense that external borders become common responsibility, will be unique rules for accepting migrants, single deportation rules for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries that are considered safe.
the ukrainian president said that after russia moved its attention to syria to ukraine, no one died.
is there a link between the two seals, a russian game?
russia has frustrated behaviour of power.
she believes that being great power means incurring americans and europeans.
from this point of view, yes, there is a link.
without the military and financial effort of the putin regime, the assad regime would probably have long collapsed.
and it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the islamic state.
some two years have been a struggle between the assad regime and the moderate secular and muslim militias, supported by the gulf and western countries.
then the islamic state was lifted and now we no longer know whether we want the assad regime to fall.
russia was able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
it creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that it is unable to close.
but you are only great power if you have solutions.
off-side game is just a strategy for time.
he is unlikely to expect offers, to press the butons to resolve the situation.
the offers are not because the world is not convinced that he can somehow solve the other issues he also created.
but i do not agree with the theories that say that these people are driven by an invisible hand.
let us not see slightly stronger than it is.
ec buton soon
millions of facebook users have become customed to the " like " button, and now social networking network representatives are preparing another opposite, the " dislike " one.
on tuesday, mark zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on his account that this button would be available soon, the new york times reported on blog.
zuckerberg said that the " dislike " button would show a nuance of what a user feels rather than just an option.
however, his announcement raised the issue that facebook could become a less friendly place.
zuckerberg noted that he wants to avoid someone posting on his account an important event in life and someone will give " dislike. "
the users of the network, who reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or the empathy with something sad.
mark zuckerberg also said it is not very comfortable for people to give' like' to current events such as the refugee crisis, or a death of a family member.
" you may not feel comfortable to be like that post, " the facebook representative noted.
a new facebook button has not been well welcomed by everyone.
" there is already enough hatred on facebook and social networking, " afghanistan's atiq haneef commented on the new york times facebook page, where the article has been posted.
" i will give' dislike' to' dislike' button, " he added.
roger anderson, an atlanta microologist, claimed there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to differ on facebook.
debra aho williamson, social media analyst with the emarketer, noted that it is hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
moreover, she says, the election campaign in america is approaching, and the " dislike " button would create a complete disaster.
only 70 refugees enter hungary 24 hours
hungary accepted only 70 migrants on tuesday, a hand from thousands of mass arrivals to its southern border with serbia, government adviser gyorgy bakondi announced.
hungary declared a state of emergency earlier the day in two counties along the border with serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it would build a fence on its border with romania, the dpa recalls.
the move drew a sharp reaction from serbia.
just yesterday, they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to apply for asylum.
" as you see, this is totally different, " serbian refugee minister aleksandar vulin said.
before imposing new immigration legislation, a record 5,809 migrants entered hungary on sunday, police announced on monday.
more than 170,000 immigrants from the middle east and africa entered hungary from serbia in 2015.
many avoid being registered and trying to reach the west, especially in germany.
" the new " headquarters of the county council is typical.
two builders in insolvency
the massive investment here in recent years to move the institution is set to come down because they have been stopped several times.
two important builders who worked here entered insolvency during work.
the county council headquarters in vasile alecsandri street will end up winding alone.
one year and a half after the consolidation and refunctionalisation of the building should have been completed, work has not reached half.
one last stage in the era of the building was consumed last days, when the national dispute resolution council (cnsc) rejected a complaint by the firm that voia to take the contract to complete the technical project for the work still to be done.
the initial draft was drawn up by impex romcatel.
after the builder's insolvency and interruption of the works, negotiation procedures are under way without publishing a participation announcement with impex romromcatel to update the technical project and then a new tender for works will be held.
" but negotiations were not completed through a contract, with the cj assessed that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution, " razvan timotimofciuc, who represented public relations within the cj said.
the cj's decision to break off direct negotiations was attacked in court by impex romcatel.
the emerging court sent the complaint to the cnsc, which has rejected it, as a tardiar.
this does not mean, however, that the cj can start looking for another project.
impex romcatel has the opportunity to attack the cnsc's decision at the court of appeals, only after its final ruling can it be to consider finding another project.
thus, work to strengthen the building could resume at the earliest next year.
our intention is to re-start work as soon as possible.
in principle, restoration of the technical project should not last long, but we need to reach a contract.
" we are waiting to see whether the cnsc's decision will be attacked or not, " timofciuc said.
work on the consolidation of the former headquarters of the police questors began in 2011.
a first works contract was terminated in april 2012, after 4.5 million lei had been done.
the tender was resumed, with the contract adjuto the moldovans.
but the firm went into insolvency, and the contract was terminated after 1.5 million lei were paid.
so far, about 50 per cent has been carried out.
initially, the consolidation, refunctionalisation and mansaration of the building had been assessed at 7.7 million lei.
" ready, i say! " -- a statement criminalising former cadastre head.
one worker involved in the scandalous dossier from the cadastral office signed an agreement to recognise the facts in prison with delay.
his statements are most likely to criminalise the other indictees, led by the former head, narciza nedelcu.
an adviser to the cadastre and real estate advertising office (ocpi) accused by the dna in a corruption file recognised its fad.
the facts recognition agreement signed by dumitru dascalu was registered at the iasi court yesterday, with judges setting for a solution in the case on september 29th.
dumitru daniel dascalu was accused of a false intellectual in his continued form and agreed to execute two years in chişinău with delay, as well as work to benefit the community.
as for the imputfacts of dascalu, prosecutors have indicated that he, as an adviser to the cadastral office, along with other colleagues, " drew up falsely in a number of accepting minutes, prprpri vying service contracts in queid previously by o.c.p.i, with company managers of gauss srl, the srsrs, called into a small group of the srplt t n n'k
last days, former office head narciza nedelcu, and other former former or current ocmo workers have been filed on the file, with charges charges charging services to mentioned companies, although the work has not been done.
the judiciary exceeds 300,000 lions.
stone era adventure
in the opinion of president frh, alexandru dedu, romania can host a major handball competition in 2024, and preparing the women's handball team for qualifying for the olympic games costs a fortune.
the president of the romanian handball federation, alexandru dedu, said at a meeting with the press yesterday that it is great pride that our country has three teams in the champions league groups.
as far as romania's women's handball team is concerned, " the main goal is to qualify for the rio olympics, but for that is, it has to go through two stages of caudine furfts, primarily the world championship, and secondly the pre-qualification tournament, " dedu du said.
we very much want to qualify for the olympic games.
these are fantastic requirements from tomas ryde's technical relay.
the staf that will be made up of seven or eight people.
he wants second coach, a doctor, two masses, coach of portals, a physical preparation, head of delegation.
they asked us to obtain qualifications, namely materials for physical training, which we have never heard.
it did everything to reach the olympic games; and i will do everything in my power to have them.
we are talking about massive investment, there is many, a lot of money.
but that is the way forward.
because we are in the stone era at the moment with preparation.
" the teams we are struggling with have these materials and have had them for some time, " said dedu, who noted they are trying to obtain the amounts needed to purchase these mts and cosr products.
president frh also referred to the infrastructure in romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
we do not have the hall in bucharest.
it is an infrastructure problem and it is shameful to call a european gymnastics championship into question.
let us not forget that olympic neighbourhoods have been built in other parts of the world within a space of two years.
before 1992, the current barcelona olympic area was a landfill and has now reached a beauty landmark.
so did in london, where the organisation of the 2012 olympics was also an investment success.
" in my view, in 2024, we can host a major competition, " dedu said.
he added that international handball bodies are willing to give romania a major competition.
for me to bring major handball competitions to romania is a priority.
mr gatu went civilised with a project, people gave their consent in principle, but it was clarified very quickly that the chamber would never be built.
i had talks with the ehf too, told them that we want, that we were able to organise and they said they agree and invite them to the first match in the new hall in bucharest and then we are talking specifically.
" so we have all the openness, and in ehf and ihf, but we don't have infrastructure, " the frh official explained.
the former handball player has avoided assessing the chances of bucharest's csm teams and hcm baia mare of ending up to four: " i have asked all the coaches to be reserved in the, that if they do not return against them. "

hamas, laughed by ratp controllers and a plier.
a tourist bank
a family of cluj tourists came to iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
after the experience, i nor my wife no longer want to calm any again in your city.
without wanting, they were met with misroneous information, the lack of rapt controllers and, bonus bonus, a fine' like the law'.
spouses arrived in iasi a few days ago, staying at a hotel at the centre and called for tourist leaflets.
they also received a plipliin which the ratp routes were been passed.
" armed " with these maps, the husbands have visited hamas.
but two days ago, they wanted to reach the palas mall.
as it was not toned with tickets in the station near the copou park, they were based on plipliant information: that they can take a ticket via sms.
no one has told them that this service no longer exists.
trusting confident, they climbed into a bus and tried to send sms after the instructions from the plier.
unfortunately for them, a team of ratp controllers emerged.
they said there has been no service for 2 years and that it was announced in the media that it was cancelled.
where can i know what was written in the local media, coming one evening before visiting the city?
i spoke to the controllers, i explained their situation, said that they do not care, it is not their job.
the attitude has been very defiant.
they said all they can do is leaving us one fine instead of 2 (thousand and wife).
" i paid, i did not want to cry my visiting day at the gendarmerie and by making statements there! " ovidiu says.
in conclusion, the family has been amended because to roneous information and controllers who " applied the blood law. "
that is not right, and i have made a complaint to ratp iasi in order to recover my money.
it is not about money, i am not being overly many, but the idea is that i felt deceived.
ghinion for violators in vassa.
accident under preventive detention
the trial of the seven violators in vassa has moved to the iasi appeals court since yesterday.
emerging magistrates tried their first trial at a non-public session in which seven young people accused of scorting an 18-year-old youth called for freedom.
before the actual start of the trial sitting, one of the outstanding judges to whom the file was assigned, viorel munteanu, made a request for abstention that was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
the magistrate served an activated at the vassa tribunal by this summer, where he was the president of the nale station, who, on april 9th, acknowledged a challenge filed by four of the defendants, placing them under house arrest.
at present, the file is being tried by a complete that includes marthical magistrical mythical and getter thinking.
previously, a abstention formulated in the dossier and judge dan an ton on the grounds that his daughter was in a relationship of competing wedlock with one of rapists' lawyers.
the two judges decided that vassa violators remain under preventive arrest.
the grandfathers will remain in prison for at least another 30 days, when jucers re-discuss possibility of putting them at large.
the follow-term for trial will take place at the iasi appeals court on october 6th.
before reaching the iasi appeals court court, the duba carrying out violators from vassa was involved in an accident produced in the neighbourhood of pacwishes, entering the car into the belt.
autoutilitara iveco with which the seven violators were transported hit a volks wagen car that walks from stradela sings, and the driver tried to return to the left.
duba circulates from pacetwishes.
the car entered iasi here because prison administration employees preferred the route from vassa to iasi to grabs and then on the bypass road.
they have thus shortened the road by a few kilometres.
immediately after the impact, the arrested escort called for another transport to take over the detainees.
shortly at the site of the accident, a car from the iasi maximum safety prison, which took over seven detainees and transported them to the appeals court.
as a result of the accident, none of them were injured.
to transfer them to the other duba, the guards surrounded the back part of the keys, and the arrests took to speed, two each.
" the incident was not reported to the police because do ua car drivers understood amicably about the damage that must be paid, " said chief commissioner madalin taranu, of the ipj.
large migrations
romania is not, nor will it be ready for what to come.
what about europe?
i say it from the outset, loud and clear: the 7000 refugees they should and should naturalise romania are, in itself, a significant significant but huge number compared to the capacity of the romanian state to manage such a project.
for romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by bucharest, amounting to around 1 500 soul, goes far beyond our good intentions of solidarity with the european union expressed in recent months.
certainly, if those migrants really accept to settle in our places, the chances of rapidly integrating them quickly into romanian society are extraordinarily small.
i am convinced that they will be the first to lose patience.
parazed by interloves and paralysed by a venvenal political class, the romanian state is proving stuck in all areas.
failure to integrate tigers is just a trivial example.
in addition, governments of any colours have been unable to absorb european funds, to make roads, kindertens or modern schools, ensure decent health care, raise the stakes on the street, create honourably paid jobs or keep their own young generation home.
why would refugees be established in another country from which they are on the run?
but what produces a lot of wonder is particularly the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt with.
we first come from the rebellion facaria of the strong eu member states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
it then comes the chilly hypocrisy of romanians who, although they have millions of scattered relatives around the world, do not yet accept the other - another language, other religion, another blood.
the fear may not steal his cared the national being.
after all, there is also hypocrisy of many migrants,, while invoke only the horrors of war as a reason for departure, does not accept another exodus destination than germany or the nordic countries.
not all refugees are syrian and there is no war in pakistan.
the simplistic way in which the crisis is analysed can only be flouted.
the causes need to be eliminated, support some and, by playing strictly in the book of political correctness, they demand peace and investment for migrants' countries of origin.
but in romania, there is peace and even enters, from time to time, some foreign capital into the national economy -- but this still does not prevent tens of thousands of romanians from leaving their country every year.
why?
in this crisis, the european union has been revealed to us that an outdated, divided and outdated construction of the situation.
we deplore the fact that romania is not able to invent a country project, but here that the eu does not have any plan for the future either.
and improvisation and threats do not help anything.
what is the eu eu use of, then, if the only advantage that romanians enjoy - the right to free movement - could be called up due to waves of refugees crossing borders as through cheese?
at some point, the war in syria will end.
not the crisis of migrants, however.
in the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, the depletion of resources, so on will push millions of desperate migrants, from asia and especially from africa, towards a better life.
with such politicians, romania is nor will ever be ready for the next.

two fratires in tomesti have allowed somspheres.
hospital taken
two 9-year-old children, or 11 years of tomesti, brothers, swallowed a number of diazepam pills.
they found home pastilleries and took them out of curiosity.
their mother was undergoing treatment, and the medicines were not concealed.
children were urgently taken to the iasi " sfanta maria " hospital.
they are stable, as the doctors say.
exclusively: a meeting that breaks your heart.
20 years he received a courageous gift: biological parents
lost in hospital in unclear conditions, in the 1990s's denial, when she had only two months of life, small, sick, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in italy in the same years when adoption was regulated, a young woman, now a blunt and beautiful girl, met the day before biological parents in a two village.
the crina will take 20 years this days and her foster parents in palpalermo thought to give their daughters loved with a staggering and courageous gift: a visit to romania, to iasi, to know their unclear past.
the " newspaper de iasi, " which witnessed efforts to search the home family after several very vague indices, witnessed these meetings that basically break your heart.
reports to reporters, emotions, statements by those involved, their reactions are truly moving and overwhelming.
the crine's story starts 20 years ago in the rusty locality, when she was only two months.
then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to hospital to the city.
at home there are misunderstandings between parents and the mother had to go home.
he decided to stand by and send me from home.
he has stopped the face, and i have not known anything since then.
" when i learned that he was in hospital, it was too late, " recalls alina alina remembers, the biological mother of the girl.
crina was admitted with her grandmother at the pascani city hospital, and then the father of the father, costica balcan, left for work in the town of alexandria, teleorman county.
their lives were broken altogether.
no longer find crina at hospital
after interning, the drc's father left for work elsewhere, and returned six months later.
meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the iasi hospital, and the father, when he returned, never found her.
i think it was now almost nine months since he was in hospital.
" she thought she was being abandoned, " a family's granddaughter.
due to financial problems, grandgrandmother could not come to iasi and the girl remained in care of doctors.
because no one was more interested in the fate of the child during all this time, she was taken over by the directorate-general for social assistance, and the protection of the iasi child, which then gave her to care for care of the placement centre in bucium.
there were years in which abandonment and adoption were more ily regulated than today in romania.
at the bucium centre was found by italy's salvadore and his wife, a couple from palermo who wanted to have their child, but still did to succeed.
they fell in love with blonduta crina and some time they had to move definitively with them to italy.
it had already been reduced nearly two years, as long as adoption formalities took.
when i saw crina, i felt before us.
" as if my wife gave him his life, " he tells us smiling salvadore, the adoptive father, while taking in the firava's hand of the girl.
crine parents alina and costica continued separately in the country, each where they could.
the father asked the rusty y authorities, but he did not receive any answer where his child could be.
police then told him that they may be dead, but in iasi parents found out what really happened to them.
when i looked for it here, they told me to the court that he was going to italy, to palermo.
and we did not look for it.
we asked god to be good.
i thought about it in all the years that have passed, but there were no possibilities to hide, let to find it.
" it is hard, " she tells us the biological mother of the in in her eyes.
but even though the years have passed, parents in the rusty y have not been forgotten.
in italy, salvadore and the wife explained to the girl he comes from and that her past links it to romania.
i was small when i found out.
i think i was five or six years old.
i reacted like a copy, i was curious.
" i wanted to know my parents in romania, " i confess crina.
and her dream was to become a reality.
in march this year, chief commissioner romica ichim, director of the regional centre for prevention, evaluation and advice antidrog iasi, was contacted by an knowledge from italy, who explained salvadore's desire to find the cr's biological family.
and searches started only from one name.
after our request from our partners in italy, we started the first steps.
we had only received one name, balcan costica, then the locality, rusty y.
shortly, i had a job with city hall there, and i could ask whether there was by good quality the name received.
they gave me some indications then, only that the person found was not the one sought.
" it really took about a month eventually to find the biological father of the girl, " chief commissioner romica ichim explains.
in all, more than three months took the authorities to find the shore and alina alina, especially as everyone had their homes in another capacity.
we began steps somewhere in march, and we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions in june-july.
" then, we established that a first meeting would take place in september, " romica ichim added.
at the weekend weekend, alina and costica first saw their girl lost at the offices of the hospital in iasi, 20 years ago.
the father, emotionally moved, could barely master his tears and his hands passed them down.
it is barely changing a few words with those around.
a week before the meeting could not even sleep.
it was emotional, emotional.
" to see your child after so many years, it is something, " she tells us invaluable, coming to the costis from the rusty y.
crine meeting with biological mother and brother
in talks with him, who is to study at a better italian university, costica balcan told him among others that if he once wants to return to him in the village, to come quietly: he can give him some sheep, capats to find a boy from village village and produce a household.
the mother is also emotional, complains, and hardly believes that this can happen to her.
i am emotional.
i did not believe that this could happen.
i have seen such cases on television, i thought in these years, i hoped, but i did not think i could be.
great emotions.
if they could forgive me.
i hope that we will visit each other in the future.
" i hope we are able to keep a link, " tells us great tears on obraalina, the mother of the drc, while keeping a servetel in hand.
he is hiding his tears, fortunately, because he will soon see soon after so long.
on the other hand, crina, which will serve in just a few days this month, 20 years, is trying to reassure itself like an emotional child.
he does not know what to expect, but he has sketted a vague idea of her biological parents.
they think they are young young, but now before the meeting they are trying to gather their thoughts, because they has a great deal to say, but nothing to reproach.
my parents are two mothers and two fathers.
but my parents are at the end of the day who have increased me.
it will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
" i hope to have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say, " i confess ina.
first family meeting in iasi
in the unification market, under the autumn sky, the rugsty family is again uniting their destiny before them in palermo.
crina is 20 years ago, finishing high school on the italian school model, but can begin a new chapter with alina and costica, her biological parents.
they are no longer dividing their borders or countries, but just a barrier: that of language.
over which, with the help of a translator, an italian local owner in the heart, easily passed.
those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of its kind, and that, in the future, if the opportunity still arises, they will do so.
it is the first event of its kind being organised, by such an emotional cargo, and i am pleased to be a success.
we at the centre have various activities, and in most cases, we are associated as an institution that deals with only the consumer people, people who are dependent on drugs.
but we are trying to give society something good back.
" if i still asked for such a food, i will do so with great heart, " says smiling romica ichim, director of the regional centre for prevention, evaluation and advice to antidrug advice.
behind it, the balcan family, in the middle, burden themselves.
i am understandable: they have a great deal to say to each other.
a truce ceasefire on the leg yesterday at the psd.
everyone draws soul
camps in the emerging psd branch ended a gunfire on the leg.
after successive rounds of talks from friday to sunday, the first and the most tense, psd leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
under pressure from party executive president liviu dragnea to present a united position, emerging social democrats will send him a list of potential candidates for party posts.
far from over, the internal war in the party seems to have taken a break to allow combatants to drag their soul.
dragnea has not come up with an ultimatum.
it has sent a very simple and very topical message under the conditions now: you are trying to find a solution not to put the party at risk.
we have party elections on 3 october.
all functions will be made available to those who want them.
" until then, we remain in the existing structure, " interim mayor mihai chirica said.
the two days of talks at the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing certain has been established.
fierce competition is expected, in the october elections as president of the psd's county branch.
on the short list of possible candidates for the main post in the party's emerging branch included secretary of state maricel popa, senator florin constantinescu, senator sorin lazar, county adviser vasile catcatea, and the acting president of the county council, victorel lupu.
added to them could be mayor of coma schitu leads, mihai mihalache.
also considered is the candidacy of psd county advisers leader cristian stanciu, unless lupu joins the race, with party sources saying he is not interested in.
the only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of former branch leader, mayor gheorghe nichita.
the list of candidates is open.
under the status, applications can be submitted, including on election day, and would not surprise anyone if they happened.
" the important is that we remain united, and we will also remain after october 3rd, when we have a new executive office, a new permanent detention office and all new leadership structures, " catea added.
until internal elections are held, the leadership of the psd county branch will be secured by victorel lupu, close to nichita and stanciu.
lupu, however, is on leave until 29 september, with preparing the elections basically to be provided by the branch's executive secretary, county adviser mihail popescu, in cold relations with the nichita camp.
contcontacted telephone, cristian stanciu praised the talks in recent days leading to " a partial consensus. "
there is a broad willingness to maintain party balance and unity.
a partial consensus was reached to support a unitary team to deal with the county.
" but on the other hand, there are several variants about intentions to join the psd iasi presidency, and the list remains open, " stanciu commented.
emerging judge turns down vassa violators file due to competition
the seven young people in the vaslui county convicted of rape are arriving to the court of iasi's appeal today.
vasluyans sentenced to five years to eight months and eight years and four months will today present their arguments about their freedom, after the basic court, the vassa judgment, set their incarceration immediately after the sentence.
the file was registered at the appeals court late last week, magistrates dan anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
anton cited that one of the defendants' lawyers, the attorney bogdan luca, is his daughter's competition, lawyer dana anton.
luca is defending silviu ovidiu burada, who received the highest sentence on this dossier.
how motivated judges
late last week, the magistrate at the vassa judgment that sentenced the seven young people motivated the sentence.
for motivation, the judge talks about the fiant reaction of defendants, but also those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
" the court finds that after a restrictive measure of freedom but not deprived of freedom was placed under a preventive measure under the impact of the attitude of indictees, their families and local supporters, was felt within the local and national community over the fact that people accused of serious deeds are tried less restrictive, " it said to motivate the vessel's judgment.
the magistrates also dismantled the main defence of the seven indictees who during the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be the " door to church. "
" the court plays that the moral quality of the highly injured person is unrelevant, something that the defendants wanted to point out through the appliances they have formulated, as the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be infringed under any pretext, " it also stated in motivation.
corbyn, brexit and the future of europe
due to economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed in recent decades cannot continue to be the same in the coming years.
until saturday, little world knew in romania who jeremy corbyn is.
even today, after he became the new leader of the uk labour party, many are wondering to what extent he can affect the election of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
jeremy corbyn is the most radical post-war labour leader.
marxist said, anti-monarchist ist (at one point asked tony blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family from buckingkingpalace), a fervent anti-american and a sympathise of vladimir putin (it has otherwise been regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel " russia today "), and terrorist movements hizbollah and hamas, wants to give up its nuclear weapons.
for corbyn, who then viewed the killing of osama bin laden laden as a real tragedy, isis is almost preferable to the united states.
on the model of all the populist demagogues, corbyn does, of course, have miracle anti-austerity solutions.
things like those he was saying and tsipras also promised in greece until it had to chgrips with the real world and economic ties.
the new labour leader's economic economic programme, among other things, massive renationalisation and the printing of money as a solution for financing development projects and for covering very generous social benefits.
of course, some might ask themselves why the solution with money printing printing is not unanimously adopted across the globe, we would then have a overall global prosperity! but who would prevent such details this kind any more.
of course, we can charge the bankers, who become a kind of service enemies of the left to blood, but far as it has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in ecuador or venezuela, but in france at the beginning of the mandates of mitterand and hollande.
additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous, uncover promises made by populist demagogues.
as margaret thatcher rightly pointed out,' the problem of socialism is that at some point, other others' money ends'.
few give jeremy corbyn a real chance of ever reaching prime minister.
in the early 1980s another radical left-wing leader, michael foot, who was not as extreme in belief as the new party leader, has lamentably failed in the elections.
and then there is still a worker' class in the uk, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
and trade unions were sensitive more influential than now.
with the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the labour force, and extensive automatiation has resulted that there is a massive need for highly qualified workforce in the industry, corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
but even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
in his latest financial times he sees corbyn's election as increasing brexit chances, britain's leaving the eu.
the new labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership.
in the eyes of the radical left, brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed austerity on the poor.
when you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that is shaking the foundations of the eu is reaching an explosive mix.
and not only for the united kingdom.
but if the british decide following the referendum, to be held by 2017, to leave the loss of symbolic capital for the entire european project and the deep fcreated inside it by the euro crisis, and now that of refugees, between north and south between east and west, are leaving room for the most worrying scenarios.
all the more so because for a whole number of member states, london was a counterbalance to the franco-german axis (where berlin berlin increasingly becomes the dominant actor).
it is true, the british business, city, are powerful lawyers for the country to stay in the eu.
but today's europe is no longer in the past.
there are many resententment, which are increasing in intensity in these very few weeks.
the problem is that brussels, we even recently had a mostra in the speech by jean clude junker, is increasingly tending to make major decisions above the head of the vast majority of the member states by consulting with only a few european powers, mainly with germany.
and this is as electoral support for the anti-system, anti-immigration establishment that are at the same time and eurosceptic is growing dramatically across the continent.
in other words, the emotional climate with negative cargo has reached higher than ever in the past.
hence, the conclusion that the financial times draws when assessing the chances of bre.
the pro-eu option is based on a cold calculation leaving from national interest.
if voters make a cerebral decision, then britain will remain in the eu.
but corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
however, eastern europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
especially if, as expected, we will see greater integration of the euro area, which will push most of the states in the region and the outskirts of the interest and decision-making in europe.
corbyn, tsipras and syriza in greece, podemos in spain, even bernie sanders in the united states are feeding their populist rhetoric from the frustration gained in bio-negotiable societies.
due to economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they enjoyed in recent decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the coming years.
under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the eurozone - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that have only taken into account the integrationist political ambitions, not not the capacity and availability of the peoples and governments of europe to respond to such a challenges, turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the eu will increase in intensity and have a major impact on the situation of romania.
and it is hard to exclude something in terms of possible scenarios.
the question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
constantin brancusi, god taran.
rockefeller: " how can i help you? "
brancusi: " the workshop takes and mature! "
the great sculptor had a great dream: be someone, get famous, hear about him around the world.
behind his renowned, however, something is almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, prescriptions for success in life.
that also has a name.
'truda'.
what about constantin brancusi?
what is, in fact, to say?
his figure appeared on notes.
and recently a known romanian bank has hired a player in a advertising client.
brancusi produces and deliver money nearly 60 years after it is no longer among us.
in romania, there are hundreds of streets and bulevards bearing his name.
in fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
and, when you stands out of odine, you hear the following instructions:' we go to the park, cheese'.
its statues envision the country.
there are few romanian figures whose works are known by so the world, from children to the elderly.
brancusi's infiltration capacity is huge.
the communists also failed to excite romania's memory and culture.
his quotations today dominate the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of chlike and share.
and, then, again, what would still have to be said, to write about this man?
seen from a lot of books and articles trying to reconstitute its destiny, the life of cheese seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
you know, there are those people who tell you that, if you were not lucky to born in any big city and in a family as well off, your chances of success in life are almost invalid.
brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
and perhaps it would be a key one here.
perhaps the forthcoming text should be started here.
with a sentence, however detestable they are.
forget the successful success stories, which are delivered to you to the newspapers and television every day.
take a close look at this man's figure.
do you want to know how to succeeded in life, how, today, he has heard a whole world?
simple.
he has been working all his life to be someone.
that is what it has done.
constantin brancusi is born on 19 february 1876 in hobita, a small fish-common village, gorj county, at carpathians.
it is the fifth child of maria and radu nicolae brancusi.
although he came from a family of wealthy ished easants, cheese makes a modest modest life, but one of which he had to collect the benchmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
recalling his childhood and places where he grew, the artist had to confess at a 1933 meeting in paris with petre tobacco: " at then life was beautiful and harmonious. "
by millennia, people were, happy, taking a patriarchal life.
everything quiet from one season to another.
and do you know why things have changed?
the great city's civilisation reaches us.
brancusi's childhood was far from idyllic.
one of the moments these first years of life is highly indicative for the combination of purity ity and violence that has characterised its future sculptor or in his homeland.
the moment is reproduced in the work " biography, " written by alexandru buican.
in 1879, constantin brancusi was 3.
in the autumn of that year, when it was done " at casan, " watching those who aste the liquid to see if the process is proceeding properly, cheese catch a moment of general disattention.
it fills its palaces with tuica and drink on the breath.
it falls into almost instantly.
the first people notice only a few minutes later.
the mother enters into panic, then in hysteria, believing that the son died them.
later on, when father radu radu returns from living alive accompanied by larels, he sees the desperate signs of those who desperately await him in his mouth from the department.
the party immediately turns into jale.
the father is already thinking about the patient buried.
however, someone finds it good to invite baba brandusa, dofats and cheese.
cheese check the child's breath, then puts them under the balega pool of horse gathered from the eve.
the hard-stretched child.
the world applauds.
while the boy is left to sleep his beside, joy, spending with gregs continues with even more force.
the next day, father and son meet through livada.
radu brancusi puts constantin gather some nunuts and bring them.
the father puts his child down with his head down and, with the ds from the boy, bats him to remember.
and, while he feels the size of blows, small cheese has the revelation that the world can be viewed from a different perspective and that things around can be overthrown around.
the sun's position, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he had to recognise in old age, if he himself participated in his unrest.
should the sun be just as troubled as his father of what happened?
the city currently works
an mp calls on politicians to remember those who voted for it.
independent deputy viorel blajut urged the psd and the pnl to stop internal fighting and refocus their agenda towards voters.
what we see now on our political scene is a great divide and that.
we have seen nothing of the 2012 usl projects to continue.
neither the highway nor the regional emergency hospital, see just how politicians dispute their possible location according to real estate interests.
let us leave a little political aside, let us gather and talk.
at the moment, the city is not working.
" if you are busy with internal war, no time for those who elected you, " blajut said.
he praised the current political class has left voters down, along with a very low turnout in the upcoming local elections, around 30 per cent, virtually representing the parties' faithful electorate.
the member also believes voters will also focus towards traditional parties, expressing reservations about new political initiatives, such as the " for iasi " party, which will be launched today.
local parties have a very small chance and will only break away from the right's electorate, not the psd electorate.
such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually on the right.
" the right is still further farking, which is not good for anyone or for the psd, " blajut said.
he said he is not interested in a candidacy for the upcoming local elections, denying rumours about his intention to join the mayoral race.
i have also said that i do not want to run for any local office.
i also consider whether to continue as a member and in the next term.
i have tried to call for unity for iasi, and in the discussions held on meetings, with the other parliamentarians, and i have been accused of wanting to give my image.
i do not want, but we cannot continue like this.
" if the people voted for us, it does not mean that they are nonsense to vote for us if they don't see anything, " said blajut, who assessed that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of alps.
a tatasi colleague said he did not get his money and go by bus.
let us not be hypocritical.
there is little money.
sometimes i am ashamed to raise the money from the house.
at the end of my mandate, i will make a report with everything we have spent, apart from the salaries of cabinet employees and maintaining it.
i happened to raise in one month and 30 000 lei, with all transport disaccounts, accommodations and others.
" to tell an mp that he does not get his money is clean hypocrisy, " blajut concluded.
