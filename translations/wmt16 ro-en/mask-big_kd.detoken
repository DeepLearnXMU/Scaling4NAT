un chief says no military solutions exist in syria
secretary-general ban ki-moon says his response to russia's military support for syria is that " there is no military solution " to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
the un chief again called on all parties, including the divided un security council to unitogether and support negotiations in order to find a political solution.
ban said at a conference wednesday that he plans to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent council-us countries, russia, china, england and france -- on the sidelines of the general assembly ministerial session to discuss syria.
ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the syrian people and regional powers " made this situation unresolved. "
ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity when they managed to reach an agreement on iran's nuclear weapons, addressing the syrian crisis.
8 figures in the polls showing donald trump has real chances
some tried to label it as a politician " flip-flop. "
others a joke.
and others are waiting for implosion.
but regardless of the way some republicans try to remove donald trump from the top of the polls, it has not worked (yet).
ten of the past 11 national polls have shown that donald trump leads with two figures, and some are starting to ask themselves seriously what that means for the chances of appointing the real estate mogul.
of course it is still premature.
none of this says the trump will win the race for nominating the republicans.
pundits shows that during the same period in 2011, rick perry's advance gave way to herman cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
and the reasons they would fight hard in the general elections are many.
but outside groups such as jeb bush's super cap and the conservative economic group club for growth recognise trump's power and are starting to support it with money.
we are still presenting to you some figures in recent polls suggesting that real estate mogul is not just something passing:
figures indicating support for trump returned to 180 degrees.
even before donald trump announced his candidacy in mid-june, a poll by the university of monmouth said only two out of 10 republicans had a positive view of real estate mogul.
by mid-july, the percentage reached 40%.
in early august was 52 per cent.
currently, six out of 10 republicans favour donald trump.
about three out of 10 say they are negative.
these figures remain.
a poll conducted last week by quinnipiac in iowac concluded that 60% of regional republicans have a favourable opinion of trump.
two-thirds of gop voters would be happy if the trump won the race for the nomination.
in a poll conducted last week by cnn / orc, 67% of republicans said they would be " excited " or " satisfied " if trump won the race for the nomination.
only two out of 10 say it would be " upset " if trump won the nomination race.
only ben carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as trump (43% says he would be " enthusiastic " about 40% saying the same about trump).
closest in terms of enthusiasm?
marco rubio, with only 21%.
on the other hand, 47% of republican voters say they would be " dissatisfied " or " upset " if front-runner jeb bush wins the race for the nomination.
most republicans do not consider trump's temperament a problem.
although donald trump has been strongly criticised for his insults and his bombastic style, 52% of nationwide republican voters believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted by abc news / washington post on monday.
we find the same figures in the state of iowa, where also 52% of republicans believe the trump has the right personality to be leader, according to a poll by quinnipiac last week.
however, 44% believe he lacks the personality to act effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say his temperament has no place at the white house, according to abc / post.
republican voters are getting used to the idea.
when they take the attitude of intellectuals, republican voters consider trump authentic.
according to a poll last week by cnn / orc, on the question of who has the best chance of winning the race for gop nomination, four out of 10 said trump.
the situation has changed since the end of july, when four out of 10 would have gambled jeb bush.
full information: in the past, gop voters have not read the future very well.
during the same period of last elections, four out of 10 republicans chose rick perry in the race for nomination, compared to only 28% for mitt romney.
however, these figures show that the majority of gop voters consider trumtrump's campaign plausible.
even though his republicans to another candidate; trump still leads everyone.
some say the divided situation is likely to contribute to trump's victory, while support for trump will split into more than a dozen candidates.
but a poll conducted in early september by the university of monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of collaboration between trump and most other republican candidates, almost always trump will receive majority support.
trump is 13 carly fiorina away, 14 marco rubio, at 15 walker points, 19 jeb bush points and, finally, 33 points each from paul, john kasich and chris christie.
it is almost on an equal footing with ted cruz.
is it the only candidate who beats him?
ben carson would beat the businessman 19 points in a one-one hypothetical confrontation.
most of donald trump's supporters say they decided.
a new poll tuesday by cbs / nyt shows that more than half of voters supporting trump say they are not changing their ballots.
obviously, much can happen about this and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave open to the possibility of changing their choice.
however, trump's most important adversary is currently ben carson neurosurgeon, but is twice as likely voters who say they decided to vote with trump.
six out of 10 republics say i agree with trump on immigration.
since donald trump called immigrants from mexico " rapists " in his campaign's opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the central topic in the 2016 campaign.
some are concerned that trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between key hispanici voters and the republican party and harm rebranding efforts.
but according to a poll conducted monday by abc / post, six out of 10 republicans say they agree with the trump on immigration.
so it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the light of the spotlight, so will remain doland trump.
frustration with the authorities is reaching new colours.
donald trump and ben carson are now backed by nearly half of republican voters, largely because of their status as outsent.
according to a poll conducted by abc / post monday, six in 10 republicans say they prefer a political outsider at the expense of experienced anyone.
people also upset washington.
a poll two weeks ago in iowa by des moines register / bloomberg found three out of four iowa republicans are frustrated by the performance of congress republicans, with 54% saying they were " dissatisfied " and 21% " nervous at coloes. "
jeremy corbyn makes debut at prime ministry's questions
since his election, the start of mr corbyn in pmqs has been long-awaited.
the new leader of the labour party, jeremy corbyn, will make his debut at prime ministry's questions later, facing david cameron for the first time.
mr corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance is likely to be closely examined by the media and labour meps.
as part of the weekly appearances, he called for " less theatre and more deeds. "
he also said he could give up some participation and succumb to his colleagues.
the confrontation will be mr corbyn's first parliamentary test, after appointing a' phantom cabinet' and his speech at the annual tuc congress on tuesday.
meanwhile, the decision by the leader of the labour party to remain silent at the words of the national anthem in a service he held on tuesday marking the 75th anniversary of the battle of england drew criticism from conservative mps and made the front page of newspapers.
corbyn's decision not to sing national anthem draws attention
a spokesman for mr corbyn said that he' kept silent' and recognised the' heroism of the british air forces in the battle of england'.
but a member of mr corbyn's phantom cabinet, owen smith, told the bbc's two's newsnight that he would have recommended that the labour leader sing the national anthem' regardless of' his belief that monarchy should be abolished.
around a dozen phantom cabinet ministers refused to be part of mr corbyn's leading team, arguing by differences of opinion on the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported it as a leader.
bbc political correspondent robin brant says differences in politics " are cumulative " in the labour party after mr corbyn was appointed regarding his position towards the european union and the benefits limit.
mr corbyn said at the tuc conference that the labour party would bring about changes to completely eliminate the idea of the limitation.
a few hours later, mr smith, the minister for labour and pensions, said the party' is very clear' in exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the' head' level from 26,000 000 to 23.000 lira.
mr corbyn will be the fifth labour leader facing david cameron in the gallery in the last decade, since he took over the leadership of the conservative party.
the labour leader, who promised a different policy approach, says that he has ideas' from foreign sources' for questions to put to mr cameron and that he has received more than 3 000 suggestions.
parliament member islington north said pmqs involves too high a level of confrontation and would refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging to focus instead on serious problems such as the poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
mr corbyn said that angela eagle, finance minister, will take his place in pmqs when he cannot participate - for example, when mr cameron moves abroad.
he also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying he has dealt with chamber of deputies president john bercow to discuss this.
when he took the lead in 2005, mr cameron said that he wanted to give up the political' punch and judy' style often associated with pmqs, but acknowledged a few years later that he failed to do so.
since the first transmission in 1990, the pmqs has been seen as a key barometer of the reasoning of a leader, the way in which he heads the chamber of deputies and its position among his fellow members, although critics say it has become a caricature and that it needs profound reform.

jd sports says higher salaries could harm enlargement
jd sports president peter cowgill says an increase in the minimum wage in britain could mean " greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers. "
however, that the purchasing power is unlikely to exceed higher labour costs within the firm, he says.
costs could have an impact on jd sports's enlargement plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
tennis australia president thanasi kokkinakis steve healy
thanasi kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticised for his behaviour.
thanasi kokkinakis has been the collateral victim in his friend's " storm, " nick kyrgios and his behaviour deserves words of praise rather than criticism, in the opinion of president tennis australia steve healy.
kokkinakis, the younger part of the ented duo often called " special ks, " was unpleasant dragged into the spotlight by the scandalous derapage kyrgios had from stan wawrinka at the montreal masters tournament.
in a ffqualification match shortly after, in five years, the seat referee had to intervene twice to disst kokkinakis and his opponent ryan harrison, after which harrison said, " wawrinka should have put him kyrgios on the ground. "
although seen last time making a dust rocket after having muscular cramle and missed a possible us open tournament, angered richard gasquet, kokkinakis was strongly defended by healy.
the teenager is currently in glasgow, where he battles sam groth for second place, after bernard tomic in the davis cup semifinal against england.
" one thing i feel strong is that in my opinion thanasi was attracted a little into conflict, " healy said.
the truth is that it broke a rocket when it lost for accusing crampe in us, but it is not the first player to break a rocket from frustration with himself and i know thanasi well enough to know he would not be proud of it.
but be serious, it has managed very well in quite challenging situations in us with harrison and so on, and i think it deserves a lot of trust.
it has an extraordinary team, it has a great family and i think it has been unfairly.
he is a very mature-year-old, works hard and integrated into the team, had no conflict with the other players, he is highly respected in the west, trained hard, he is in an excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young man and he is worth trial solely on the basis of his qualities and defects.
healy also backed the decision not to take into account kyrgios for the key landmark match, which begins friday, and described the " joint decision " as the most suitable for all, but advocated the return of player originally of long-term canberra to the team.
" first of all, we want the team to focus fully on the reble game and not to think at all about the controversy surrounding [kyrgios], " healy said.
and i think nick moved up very quickly, as people like federer and murray said, he matures under the public's eyes and made some terrible mistakes and is worth criticism, but we are trying to support him, trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and i think he needs a time when he is not at the centre of attention in order to reflect, as good as his team.
2016 elections: hillary clinton's advantage over bernie sanders shshrunk by half in national polls.
former secretary of state hillary clinton still has a two-digit lead in the democratic race for national candidacy, but senator bernie sanders is gaining ground.
clinton is now backed by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while sanders is second with 27% (17%).
vice president joe biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15% of democratic voters.
at least five months before the start of primary elections, the majority of democratic voters say it is too early to say they were decided on the candidate they will support.
but clinton's supporters are stronger in their election than supporters of other candidates.
compared to the cbs news poll last month, clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while sanders won several per cent.
clinton retains the lead among women and moderates, but the advantage has shrunk.
male support has diminished considerably and sanders is only 5 points away.
clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and it is now on a par with sanders.
however, clinton still benefits among elderly voters.
last month, clinton was before sanders, two-digit figures, among the liberals, but sanders now has a slight 5-point lead in this group.
about half of the democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support clinton if elected to run on behalf of the party.
a quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represent the party.
six would not support it.
perhaps unsurprising, clinton's current supporters are likely to be enthusiastic about her election is high.
opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support clinton -- only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
while 48% of democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support clinton, the number of republican voters who say the same about first donald trump (35%) is lower.
when clinton's supporters are asked an open question why she would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has adequate experience (16%), followed by why the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and is the best candidate for the post (10%).
clinton's supporters also point to her association with bill clinton (9%).
agreement on these and eligibility is also mentioned.
with the vice president considering possible presidential candidacy, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him in the race -- though one third believe he should not run.
on the question of the second option for the party representative, democratic voters mostly call biden.
of clinton's proponents, more than half say biden would be the second option, well ahead of sanders.
if biden decides not to run in the democratic party race, hillary clinton's lead over sanders grows, from 20 points with biden in the race to 30 points if he is not running.
55% of democratic voters see clinton as the most likely candidate of winning the general elections; but the figures dropped from 78% they were last month.
biden is second, however, that the percentage is most eligible has risen.
however, when asked what is most important for an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer the problems instead of eligibility.
as last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well in terms of several key characteristics towards their party's primary voters.
most voters see clinton, sanders and biden as full and reliable and with solid leaders.
biden is best seen of all three in terms of integrity, while clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not believe that h. clinton is integrated and reliable, twice as many as those who say so about sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion on it.
democratic voters also generally believe that the three, clinton, sanders and biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
on all these issues, about a quarter of democratic voters do not think on sanders.
as questions persist about using a personal email address and a server by hillary clinton while serving secretary of state, the majority of democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of subject and say she did not affect their general view of the candidate.
but things are different among the us public.
half of the americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only a third are satisfied.
public opinion was divided on the issue in march, shortly after the issue came to light.
most americans say the controversy over the email did not affect their general view of clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion negatively.
mainly the republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their view on clinton.
although democratic voters consider clinton integrate and reliable, this continues to raise issues among voters in general: only 32% consider it integrate and reliable, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in may.
62% of voters do not see it as to be integrated and reliable.
at the same time, 55% of voters at national level do not consider the trump and tru@-@ worthy.
however, both clinton and trump have white leadership.
of the six surveyed candidates biden, carson and bush rank first in integrity.
the number of those who consider sanders integrer is higher than those who disagree but, as with carson's case, many do not think it.
the margin of error for 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
five members of brotherhood indicted for the year 1 murder of student at baruch faculty
nearly two years after a university student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the pocono mountains of pennsylvania, five people were charged with the murder.
members of the pi delta psi brotherhood at new york's baruch faculty brutally attacked chun " michael " deng during a ritual of initiation in september 2013 and postponed taking him to hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
official sources say the victim was tied in the eye, was put behind him a 141kg ruckpack full of sand and has been bullied repeatedly while trying to move towards a target on frozen land.
mr deng accused headaches before losing knowledge.
members of the delta psi brotherhood did not call the emergency number after it fainted and claim to have waited an hour before taking it to hospital, police say.
but they found the time needed to change deng's clothes, seek google symptoms and contact national brotherhood president andy meng to seek advice, police chief chris wagner said at a press conference.
" at this point, members have started hiding personal goods and practically put the good of the brotherhood ahead of michael deng's good, " wagner said.
it could not be resursuscted and died the next day in the morning.
according to an autopsy report, deng suffered repeated traumas on its head, trunes and coapses.
" too many families have been devastated by the brothers rituals, since 1970 at least one student lost his life every year due to the rituals, " douglas fierberg, deng's family lawyer, said in a statement.
their brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step taken by the authorities is important.
the monroe district grand jury recommended that the top five members be charged with third degree crime.
thirty-two other meries of the brotherhood, including mr meng, will also be indicted for ultraj and complicity in the murder.
" we want to hold accountable not only the people involved but, if there is an organisation that authorised the brotherhood, officially or informally, we will also hold it accountable, " wagner said at a press conference tuesday.
baruch faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representative.
that is what will happen when the federal reserve increases.
the interest rate will increase and the bull market (growing market) will be ticking, bond profitability will increase and the economy will go into recession.
that is what we know.
what we do not know is how long it will happen and how long it will take.
in the economy, history gives little indication of employment.
after the first interest rate increase, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
the aggressiveness of the federal reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
that is why officials from the us central bank have emphasised so strongly that investors should not focus on when interest rates are starting to rise, but on the path of the time needed for normalisation.
indeed, there are many variables at stake.
but, in the end, market players might see that all the fuss surrounding an increase in the interest rate has been exaggerated.
" the first increase in interest rates decided by the edf after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the " cheap money " era, " capital economics chief economist julian jessop, said in a note to customers.
on the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of us interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
but it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
we are still on the table how a few sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
given the situation the market has experienced in recent months, the anticipation of an interest rate increase can make things volatile for some time.
however, at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
" it seems that there is a tendency that the profitability of capital will stagnate for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which perhaps reflects the breakdown in monetary policy again, " deutsche bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after edf increases.
specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by around 14 per cent - moving towards an interest rate increase, quite invariable over 250 days after (the average climation of 2.6%) before returning to normal 500 days, with an average return over the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published by the chief veen management strategy.
deutsche has stated that the impact on actions tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle, and the benefits are beginning to fall.
the recession is a reality of economic life, but raising the interest rate often contributes to it.
in the current situation, the edf faces some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession.
specifically, gross domestic product will move closer to its historic minimum point for an increase in the edf interest rate.
according to deutsche bank, out of the 118 interest rate increases after 1950, only twice nominal gdp was less than 4.5%.
even though in the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to edf atlanta.
raising the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question of " whether this time it is different, " deutsche said.
the market players prepared all the year for a growth decision from the edf, with all eyes focused at this week's meeting of the federal open market commission, which ends on thursday.
although numerous strategists and economists believe fomc could approve an interest rate increase at the meeting, long-term transactions indicate only 25% probability.
" in our study after 1950, all cycles for increasing the interest rate to date have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with gdp eclipping the varieties before the recession very quickly after recovery began, " the report said.
on the contrary, this has been a odd slow recovery since the worst recession under consideration.
the current cycle is by far the longest awaited by the edf since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months and it has reached 74 months and continues.
fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase and the printing is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
the main difference is that the impact is faster in bond case than in the case of actions when the edf amends policy.
in the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits change course as soon as the first growth / decrease occurs in the cycle.
at the end of the cycle of raising the interest rate, the profitability of bonds is falling immediately, " deutsche said.
strategies charles schwab believe that these interest rate increases will bring profitability between short-term and long-term bonds closer, applauwing the curve.
bonds with high profitability are doing better in such an environment, although " we are still wary of forcing profitability, " fixed income analyst, kathy jones, said in an analysis.
interestingly, jones is of the opinion that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of edf policy.
" apart from the power of the dollar and lowering estimated inflation, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy, " jones wrote.
short-term interest rates have increased, curbing profitability is fairer, the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the edf tightens up policy.
by and large, companies operating mostly in the us will benefit from an interest rate increase and local products will become more attractive.
high-indebted multinationals will suffer because the rise of the dollar will make their products more expensive in the area of the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
" history shows that " quality " stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months after an initial increase in the interest rate, " analyst goldman sachs said in a customer report.
strong balance sheets exceeded those with a poor balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
high capital companies and low-volatility stocks have also exceeded similar low-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
debt will become an important issue.
companies with a large percentage of fleet debt have the most to lose, goldman says.
consumers will also benefit from the dollar increase.
rescuers could also benefit, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
bbc radio 3 a fm copy, says parliament member andrew bingham
conservative mp andrew bingham has criticised radio for " foolish "
he says increasingly similar to trade opponent
the bbc music awards also took an eye, saying they plaged brits awards.
my colleague damien collins attacked the voice, saying the show was not original either.
bbc radio 3 " turns into " fm classic, a senior lawmaker said, putting pressure to prove he is doing something that do not do.
conservative mp andrew bingham also told bbc heads that " silol " public radio and increasingly resembles the trade opponent.
" i have the impression that radio 3 " foolish " -- although i don't like to use the word -- but i have the impression that it is turning into fm classics, " he said.
the bbc music awards, launched last december, also took an eye.
the bbc music awards, launched last year appear to be brits under another name.
so, if you are trying to do something different -- these are the two examples that come to mind that only copicopy what already exists on the market, " mr bingham said.
the bbc director-general denied the accusations, saying bbc radio 3 is well in front of its trade opponent in terms of live music and public education.
i will not find out anywhere about classical music i know from radio 3.
and his commitment to live music and production is not a rival.
" in addition, i think the commitment of radio 3 to uncover new music and the allocation of new plays is also important, " he said.
in the first part of this year, bbc radio 3 editor alan davey said he must do more to draw an audience from the previous period because the british have less knowledge of classical music.
but radio 3 was not the only element under the bbc logo criticised at a meeting of the culture, media and sports committee for going in the footsteps of its trading rivals.
conservative mp damien collins attacked the voice -- the talent show bought by the bbc from dutch producer talpa media for about gbp 2million.
do you understand why there is often talk of that because it is not original and distinguished by nothing?
lord hall insisted that the bbc1 show -- with paloma faith and boy george in juriu -- be conducted " in a bbc specific manner. "
he added that he wants the corporation " to find chicken with gold eggs in its own ograyard " next time he launches an entertainment show.
however, he refused to ban in future the taking over of new seasons in the voice or spend money going on licenses on other entertainment facilities.
internet sales drop in august, guilty could be black friday
in the first three months of 2015, online sales rose 7.
in the last month, there has been the slower growth since 2000.
online sales gained momentum three years ago, due to mobile phone use to shop.
experts say black friday in november could be reluctant to spending.
for more than a decade now, online shopping has exploded and has turned the commercial streets of britain into phantom cities.
specialists, however, say there are signs that online sales are diminking, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
the total money spent in august presented the lowest since 2000, with an increase of only 5 per cent over the past year.
experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating only 7% growth in the first three months of 2015.
" if we look at the level of growth in previous years and return to 2000, there has always been a trend of rationalised over time, " imrg sales index editor andy mulcahy told the guardian.
he explained online sales gained momentum three years ago when buyers started using mobile phone to shop.
in this way, the number of people who could make online purchases increased and do so under different circumstances, such as canapea.
but now that it is stagnating a little, you could see a decrease (in growth).
the black friday phenomenon imported from america is cited as one of the reasons for falling sales.
in expert opinion, buyers would refrain from procurement ahead of the event in the last friday in november.
last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked in front of computers to put their hands on offers, leading to the collapse of websites by several retailers.
specialists say black friday, when shoppers beat on bargains, could lead to the buyers' reticence.
a study published by the british retail consortium determined that at least 1 per 5 is spent online.
in the case of certain products, such as televisets and washing cars, more than a third of purchases are currently being made via online shops.
at the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and online shoes rather than turn to fashion shops.
following the sanctions of the bin laden family, muslims bury victims killed as a result of the collapse of the bloodshed in mecca.
the bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were taken to muslim streets, with the first funeral held in mecca.
saudi arabia partly blamed construction giant saudi binladin group for collapse.
health minister said a total of 394 people injured following macarane's collapse
at the street walk ceremony, hundreds of muslims gathered to bury 29 victims, killed due to a crcrcrane at the great mecca mosque.
dressed in white, those complaining about their deaths joined on the way to express their condolences, until the first dead has reached the end of his final trip to the al-moaissem cemetery.
a sad memory kept by the holy place, where only a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the mosque's facility, falling on believers.
the bodies were released for the funeral after saudi arabia's king penalised the bin laden family construction group for the disaster, which also resulted in 394 injured.
at a ceremony on the street, hundreds of muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed due to a crcrane at the great mosque in mecca.
the victims included the father of four children, qasim akram, from bolton, great manchester, in his first pilgrimage when the macauane crashed.
mr akram is in the great mosque with his parents before the start of hajj pilgrimage annually.
saudi authorities have already promised that a hajj pilgrimage in mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
today, king salman said that the binladin group should not have left the arm of the high crane when the slaughter was not in operation.
an arab version of the decree, published by the saudi news agency, said the binladin group partly bears the blame for collapse.
the news agency's english service did not present the detail, but said company leaders had been barred from leaving the country.
earlier this week, salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the crcrin in the grand mosque's mosque, where hundreds of thousands of muslims came ahead of hajj pilgrimage later this month.
the binladin group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the cranes and group representatives could not be contacted for statements.
the royal decree blamed the group for failing to use up-to-date safety measures and failing to co-ordinate its work with weather authorities.
dozens of cranes surrounding the great mecca mosque as part of the massive construction effort led by the binladin group.
for decades now, the binladin family has had a close relationship with saudi arabia's royal family and has been carrying out major construction projects.
the last leader of al-qaeda, osama bin laden, was a " reneged, " " disinherited by the family in the 1990s.
the collapse occurred in strong wind and rain, just days before the arrival of millions of people regking to participate in pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every muslim physically pressed.
authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
authorities have decided that relatives of the deceased victims should receive one million saudi arabia (gbp 174,000) and the same amount should pay to those with permanent injuries.
other injured people will receive half of that amount.
credit conversion and disadvantages in swiss francs
two offers for conversion into credit lei into swiss francs have already appeared on the banking market, the main advantages being to exclude foreign currency risk and lower rates.
the disadvantages may come in a few years' time, when variable interest can lead to an increase in rates.
the transylvania bank has just completed the process of credit conversion into francs granted by volksbank, and the post has announced the conversion offer for its own clients.
according to data cumulated by analysts at the financial portal finzoom, the post offers three years of fixed interest rates at the lei of 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
on the other hand, the transylvania bank's offer for conversion was accepted by 83 per cent of customers with loans in francs due to two successive cuts: the balance of the risk and management fees paid by the customer customer was reduced, then an additional 22.5% reduction to the balance in lei was applied.
both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, from how much they paid equivalent in lei before converting.
thus, the transylvania bank is reducing the rate by 42.5 per cent, and bankpost, by 33 per cent in the first three years and theoretically by 18 per cent in the coming years.

the main advantage of the co-in in credit lei in the chf is that the currency risk is eliminated, with the consumer protected by future increases in the franc, and the repayment of credit will be made in the currency he receives his salary.
another major advantage of both offers for conversion is that there is no further reassessment of property, additional guarantees and another proof of income are being requested.
in practical terms, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of credit, nor will there be additional costs as in the event of refinancing.
both banks also offer a reduction at the monthly rate compared to much customers paid before converting, equivalent to lei.

the problem is that the early years rate is made more of interest and the customer is repaying very little mainly.
the very low interest-interest offer in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
it is not known, however, how this interest will evolve after three years.
the margin offered to customers may be more than 3.25 per cent, so in all, and the cost reduction is lower.
one possible risk to all credits in lei at variable interest, is that the robor index will increase significantly in the coming years (more than the liblibor-chf) index.
robor at three months, for example is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6% over 15% in 2009, and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
in addition, other costs may also arise, not mentioned in the initial offer.
it is time for decisions on interest rates for the us federal reserve
the world looks at a scheduled meeting in two days' time, wednesday and thursday, when the us federal reserve will make a crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
in a reuters poll conducted with the participation of 80 economists, just over half who last week thought the decision would be made, i now believe the situation will remain for some time and that interest rates would be kept within the current range of 0-0.25%.
this is an historic event because seven years have passed since the federal reserve brought the rates to zero.
for the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up its zero rate and initiate a process of normalising interest rates, " said angel ubide, chief analyst at the peterson institute for international economics.
the us economy has evolved relatively well, with recovery bringing usd trillion and generating low inflation.
however, the federal reserve must not ignore the global situation any less rosy.
he warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
the decision will be announced on tuesday, 20: 00 the tec.
stars who lost their appeal
actor (left), with his son redmond (right), experienced stressful situations in recent years.
in 2001, he battled leukemia and in 2009 he lost his life partner, farrah fawcett, to cancer.

all this certainly has a cost.
manchester united player luke shaw has been sitting for months because of double fractures.
luke shaw suffered a double fracture on his right leg in manchester united's champions league match, which ended with a defeat to psv eindhoven.
after the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and keeps the bar for at least six months, louis van gaal remains optimistic that shaw will be able to play this season again.
the injury followed reckless intervention by héctor moreno in the 15th minute after shaw, 20, broke psv defence.
he received healthcare for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before taking to hospital.
van gaal said, " he has double fracture on his leg and is in hospital. "
it will be transferred tomorrow, or perhaps the day after tomorrow, then it will be operated in manchester.
it is appalling - a boy who came to manchester united when he was 18 years old, has difficulties, then he plays fantastic and now that is the case.
oxygen was put a mask in the west.
.
i am not a doctor, but at the double fracture it is six months and will not play in the group phase.
i hope that they can play this season again.
it seems that moreno has had good luck and has escaped the red card and the concession of a penalty coup.
referee nicola rizzoli has not punished mexican.
van gaal suggested the italian official wrong.
you can judge alone when i say that this is a foul and red card.
it was a very ugly intervention with two legs.
a message on shaw's twitter account:' thank you all for your messages, i have no words to express how weakened i feel, the road to recovery begins, i will come back stronger'.
similar news: manchester united hit by luke shaw's injury in psv defeat
the bottom of england's team has an additional reason to recover to play at the european championship in france next june.
phillip cocu, coach psv, said " this's a very ugly injury. "
everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
our players never seek to accidde an adversary.
moreno broke his leg by playing for mexico's national against the national of van gaal-led netherlands at the 2014 world championship.
" it is very difficult because she did not intend to harm his opponent, and when you hear he is very serious, it's not good, " cocu said.
i have not seen.
i only managed to see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed [moreno] reached it but could not see luke's intervention.
in his statement for sbs6, moreno said:' i know how it is, i know how difficult it is to go through this.
i feel bad, i am so sorry.
psv player andrés guardado also reached hospital after intervention from chris smalling.
adam lyth clearly sked england's omission, but still angry
victory over pakistan in the united arab emirates is a difficult task but, having seen the team selected by england for the tournament, i do not consider a 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
i would not eliminate a misplaced victory either.
alastair cook's team may have less experience than three years ago, but it has good spplayers in the firing line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive attitude of youth.
moeen ali develops as spinner and adil rashid, even if unknown to the test level, is an option for the attack.
similar topics: adam lyth left england's team for test matches and replaced by alex hales.
obviously, as his chief coach in yorkshire, i find it difficult to look at the decision not to select adam lyth on the team.
he played the seven test matches against two good strikers under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are on trial after the results.
there were no question marks about joe root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and i said this before - the players are their own selection.
for a fifty years and perhaps lyth extended his run, but his destiny is in his hands.
i hope that if more run for yorkshire will have other opportunities.
the head coach of the england team, treva bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance did not match his capacity and does not surprise me; above all, he is a team man.
it is hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noted in the test matches.
lyth had seven run -- like sam robson before him -- while nick compton had nine.
only compton had good luck at home and in travel.
the only displeasure you can have was that england preferred jonathan trott on the caribbean tournament - when lyth was in its maximum form - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
the team comes alex hales, a batsman i share very well.
he is a cricket player who has the " x factor " and i noticed earlier in yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a pitch trent bridge.
it should be at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the uae team.
the idea of moeen opening up to beates with cook was launched, which would lead extra spinner while preserving four quiches, and i have nothing against it.
i do not see why a throw er could not strike there and this clumsy player has already shown that the naive is being given.
moeen may not bring success to his district, worcesterestershire, but it was 3 for them, so the difference is not large.
my old team colleague, justin langer, played his first 38 test matches as first drop before entering the open in 2001.
it immediately wiped out three centuries and did not look behind.
zafar ansari comes to the back-up spinner post and, although i had limited contact with him, he struck me of being a very impressive young man.
people could judge their early age -- with an average of 31 to beatings and 35 in the ball -- and might think it is bridges, but there is no lot of thorny and the selection opted for young people.
it will learn a great deal from this tournament.
england also made some changes to the training team.
the appointment of mahela jayawardene, sri lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches could be a coup.
it is one of the best players and will bring a great deal of experience, as it has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
paul collingwood comes for the tournament's white-ball leg and will bring both energy and ruthless ambition.
i have always believed he was born to engage in the international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and like mahela, has a intuition.
sometimes, new voices in the west, even if they send out messages that have been sent even before, can bring fresh air to the team.
colly durham's teammate ben stokes rest for the one-day matches, root received a similar break against australia, and i have no problem with that.
while disagree, coaches and selection are not doing the programme.
and remember, players' jobs depend on the results they achieve.
such decisions are never easy.
brexit camp could prevail if the economy remains in the lull by 2017
every day, the strategy for renegotiating david cameron to keep britain in the eu is increasingly entering the mess, even without the election of jeremy genius' yes or no?' corbyn to head the labour party or tuc makes serious criticism of europe on tuesday.
foreigners also have characters such as corbyn and nigel farages.
a european diplomat explained in the past days that -- submerged in crises similar to that in the eu -- not all of which are caused internally -- some member states are fuelled by britain's agenda by concessions and changes to the treaties, which the majority do not want.
at its annual meeting in brighton, tuc decided that they did not want it if they erode social protection.
we could even call it dave and george' sel' agenda.
the prime minister and chancellor are attending bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, make a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and say they won allies for reform.
it is just about me.
my european friend, who wants britain with an outward perspective under the eu roof -- " do not leave us alone with france, " berlin says -- suggests that more ministers and narrow officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they do not care if they remain or leave.
angela merkel, who is extremely cautiously, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave her position before her situation shaks, as happened with thatcher (11 years old), mitterrand (14) and kohl (16), who sat too long.
french president françois hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
his power is also in decline.
poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, spain on the left.
it is hard to believe that they will help the english who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent scotland from leaving britain - something they do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
thus, some ministers may even plan to make remarks that do not help, in the snp style, in the campaign for the uk referendum in 2017 to speed up the brexit process, my grandfather suggests.
" renegotiation was fixed " and " britain has achieved no value from renegotiation. "
europeans know on their skin how defending fleet street can be and how sceptical oligarchic media barons who view the eu with scepticism, because they did not participate in tony benn's 1975 referendum that ratified our 1973 entry into report 2: 1.
perhaps he vaguely remember boris johnson, euro-opportunistic, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a co-ent of brussels.
ed miliband knew enemies.
they have included the mix of unpaid bags, foreigners with telephone fraud and pseudo non-domes holding most important newspapers.
in fact, tony blair sees them roughly the same but realised that when you are closed in a cage alongside a nervous gorla, you have to give him bananas to distract his attention from the thought of eating at noon and again on tea.
in fact, miliband was more blairted than blair in opposition to the idea of a referendum by cameron, as blair made a concession on the principle to the abandoned eu constitution, buried by french and dutch voters in 2005, which gave him an exit card.
the media did not forgive him either.
but jeremy corbyn, who reached my friend by us at westminster on monday - i told him not to spend his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting from egg the murdoch strategy to boycott neil kinnock of the 1980s, a mistake even now.
it can take, but it must develop a coherent strategy for co-operation with the media, not with me, but certainly with andrew marr whose position in the bbc left a holiday sunday.
corbyn's official position towards europe is what i would strongly call development.
he says he would like to stay in a reformed eu.
most of those who disagree with conservative' anglicism' may agree to that.
she said hilary " a benn, but not a lch " benn on radio and tv this week, when his researcher struggled not to recognise that corbyn's appointment john mcdonnell as " in shadow " minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
he reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on tv to be unfair to labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing his job in the cabinet.
hilary's fight was more attractive.
but the fight to remain " in any situation " -- benn's expression -- does not correspond to what mcdonnell said, nor to what the jc told colleagues and lawmakers at a private meeting monday night.
whatever image corbyn wants to convey - remember, he has also made me aware - the discipline of messages remains important in the television era, and particularly in the varieties of social networks, a paranoia and treason hotbed.
it is right not to give cameron a' yes' ticket in europe, allowing him to take good labour support in the referendum campaign, as mcdonnell said.
simon jenkins certainly believes.
but basic sohistry of mcdonnell and corbyin about eu membership -- in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a hesitant discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom small differences' narnarsism is a central dogma.
as with sophistry or nato - tom watson is adamant that the jc will not campaign to give up - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
why should they waste paris or berlin political capital - and there are suspicious voters - on concessions towards britain when everything could be useless?
the us is already quite disappointed with english' poor military performance in iraq, libya and syria, even with a conservative government that is cutting costs, as i was reminded at the launch of british influence security forum on monday.
specialists criticise england's public health department decision on electronic cigarettes
according to researchers, what a government agency said that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with links in the tobacco industry.
specialists in the editorial team of the british medical journal (bmj) joined the lancet in their criticism of the evidence used by england's public health department (au) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
dea, who published the " reference " report last month, described it as a " complex analysis of evidence. "
several researchers, however, have questioned the data robustness and pointed their finger at links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
an article published last month in lancet medical magazine attacked the " extraordinarily fragile basis " that the main conclusion was founded.
two other researchers writing in bmj questioned the claims and basof them " on solid land or on moving sand. "
martin mckee, a professor of european public health at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, and simon capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at liverpool university, said, " a fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on proof of effectiveness. "
they said they expected the assertions that " current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking " are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
in reality, only one meeting attended by 12 people has led to the drafting of a multi-criteria decision-making model (mcda), summarising their views on the negative effects associated with various products containing nicotina; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research piece of work.
mckee and capewell, or said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called euroswiss health, whose executive director said to have previously received funding from british american tobacco to conduct an independent study.
it also validated bat's public health accreditation in a sustainability report, he said.
they added that one of 12 participants in the meeting said funding received from a producer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding there are reports would have received from the cigarette and tobacco-producing company, philip morris international.
arguments have not been provided on the basis of which placmembers have selected selected, but these include some " brothers " known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some even declare financing the industry in work.
other meeting participants are not known for tobacco control expertise.
the head of the tobacco tobacco control section also attended the meeting.
the research work prepared by the group " convincingly covered " that there is a lack of " solid evidence of the detrimental effect most products have according to most criteria, " mckee and capewell said.
however, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the report.
mckee and capewell said claims claims " so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers " are premature.
professor kevin fenton, director of the ea's health department, says he has responded in the past to claims in bmj.
he said " electronic cigarettes significantly less harmful than smoking "
one in two people who have smoke all their lives due to this vice.
all the evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic cigarettes for health is under-age compared, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
the eci has a clear duty to inform the public about information arising and those which does not come out of evidence, in view, in particular, the high degree of public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
every year, around 80,000 people lose their lives from a disease associated with smoking, and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking reach gbp 2 billion.
clearly stating the current evidence - namely that although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risk, they only present a fraction of the detrimental effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

amnesty's film had more than 100,000 visual views on facebook within 24 hours and created by the vccp advertising agency that worked pro bono, while graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked free of charge.

they were played with making a more realistic advertisement, but " enriching it with strong animations and colours, has been more striking. "
" they have done a great job in helping us increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair, " says tom davies on behalf of amnesty.
the uk authorities would now need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded and delivered to the door.
perhaps the most creative form of art on the arms fair comes from inside excel, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.

violinist david grimal: there were no world tours during bach.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people who were working, artists and not trade representatives.
french violinist david grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a list but also as the initiator of a less ordinary project, downright' strange', as he himself says,, les dissonances - an orchestra of international soloists and talented musicians, who plays a symphony repertoire without having a conductor at least curious.
les dissonances was at the enescu festival this year with two performances: a performance sunday, in which solist was david grimal, founder of the orchestra, and one month, when violcelist xavier phillips, with works composed up by enescu being nelipsite.
both performances, held on the athens stage, showed the public another kind of performing classical music.
les dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 at the time being the only classic musical whole in which there was no conductor.
conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
it is true, on the one hand musicians need education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - they speak of toolbox, not composers.
they are' specialised workers'.
they themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.
on the other side of the scene, for the public, all musical reporting focuses on conductor.
and thus business, the music industry, is marketing.
therefore, we are no longer talking about music.
so if we look at this world, we have qualified workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and a public who cannot listen, but they has to look at, which is stupid, " david grimal thinks.
the violinist tells that the change in the way music came from his " musical deception " in his solist career.
i was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise worldwide with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and bring money to the music industry.
10 years ago, when i was around 30 years, i found this very depressing, because we no longer found human creativity and fraternity in this system.
so i found no point in continuing along this path.
that is how i decided to create les dissonances.
this was in 2004, and at that time no one did so without a conductor:' the music world, highly conservative, did not want such projects'.
" how do you imagine making collective marketing by musicians in which ego ego no longer exists? " the artist asks.
david grimal acknowledges that les dissonaces is " a luxury, " making it clear that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
in 10 years of the picture's existence, the lack of a conductor did not prove to be a hindrance in the music act:' curiously, we weigh a more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in work and not just in role,' grimal mal, adding that at sunday's show' we were 74 conductors on stage'.
in grimal, the enănescu festival is' very courageous', precisely because it also invited les dissonances:' an extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras in the world singing 3 times a day, and amid these orchestras also invited this strange group'.
in a temple of orchestras tradition, such as the enănescu festival, there is a place and interest in something different, which breaks barriers.
speaking about enescu's work, the violinist acknowledges he feels romanian music of the famous romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced enescu works on his repertoire.
grimal notes that enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is when we are talking about george enescu and romanian music, " because there is also a george enescu who made french music. "
grimal advocates changes in the way classical musical education is done, considering that' the profession of musician, as organised today, has a death flavour' and that' the future of music represents music itself'.
we do not need to tour the world 5 times a year if it serves nothing.
during the age of bach there were no world tournaments.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people who were working, who were artists and not trade representatives.
for me, organising concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albums, they are all formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they do at the service of music.
if not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, no longer has freedom.
to illustrate this phenomenon, david grimal set an example to romanian products before and after joining the european union:' in romania, before entering the eu, you had good vegetables and meat. "
to enter the eu, you have had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
production and agriculture reach the service of supermarkets, as is the case in france.
with music the same thing happens, it is the same logic.
les dissonances makes tomatoes perhaps not too beautiful, but when we cut them they are tomatoes.
in an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and that institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done from education policy.
" if we thought -- as the koreans do, the chinese, the japanese -- that western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its learning to school, we would reintroduce concerts on tv, and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products, " grimal believes.
there are certainly things in classical musical education that remains very communist everywhere, is something very militarised.
it is up to this discipline if we compare a soldier musician, or form a musician who will sing at an instrument and, above all, a musician.
this is a completely different education if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) we must be if we want to form a musician, it is quite different.
according to your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? " does the french artist asks, smiling.
grimal shows that for artists, the carrot another kind of doing music comes precisely from overcoming this status as " soldier soldier, " overcoming what " they believe are their limits ": " musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, which is why after the concert smilators come out. "
david grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist " festival of ideas, " a discussion with the public held at the george enescu international festival by the aspen romania institute.

cinema city seeks " small big voices "
cinema city launches its biggest challenge for children: doubling two figures in the superproduction " 3d snow snow. "
do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child, who likes films?
it gives him the opportunity to reach stars.
in september, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children willing to reach future stars and between 8 and 16 years old, cinema city is looking for " small big voices, " giving them an extraordinary opportunity to double two figures in a famous animation film.
if emphasis was placed in classical cartoings on approaching the voice of the actor to the specificities of the animated character, emphasis has recently taken into account when creating the stories and those who are to interpret the voices, and they are usually very known actors.
cinema city romania, however, wants to discover new voices, which is why we are starting an unprecedented campaign.
we want to find the right voice and we challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
they will have special experience, because the characters are sympathatic and replicas are funny.
" children will enjoy themselves and have a real chance of being part of a team of actors, " said ioana ionescu, marketing manager of cinema city romania.
in the first competition phase, from september 11th to september 30th, cinema city organises a shortscreen that will choose 10 children (five girls and boys boys) who will have the opportunity to stage a test in a record studio with professionals.
all parents have to do is access the micilecimari.cinema-cityro ro platform, where to enter the child in the contest and prepare it for the voice.
they must then choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is to read and then the child will register by performing its own double version.
four films about friendship, basm heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the event: " pene galbene 3d, " " mune: guard of 3d, " " blinky bill: koala cel poznas 3d " and " albinuta maya 3d. "
finally, the two most talented children (one girl and a boy) will see their fait accompldream and double double a figure in the superproduction " the snow queen -- the 3d snow, " which will premiere in romania this november.
fedex earnings are mixed, the fiscal forecasts for 2016 decrease
fedex said disappointing results for the last quarter, with the giant in the field of supplies reducing profit estimates for the whole year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
the company also said it plans to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
during the same period last year, fedex announced he would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
company shares dropped by about 2.5 per cent in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of wednesday's opening bell.
fedex corp. said he expects to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in may next year, 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
analysts expected $10.84, according to a factset poll.
the falling estimate comes despite price hikes by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on january 4th and the higher surcharges for land transport of large or heavy heavyweies, which will apply since november.
the company said it still expects increased gains from the previous year as a result of reduced costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
president and director general fred smith said " the firm faces a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially as regards global production and trade. "
serbian employment plans were announced a day after ups competitor said it plans to employ additional 90,000-95,000 workers, about the same number of employment it made last year.
in the quarter that ended on august 31st, fedex won $692m, which is 6% more than the previous year.
earnings per share were $2.42, below $2.44 per share by 12 analysts who responded to the zacks investment research poll.
the profit increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
six analysts who participated in zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
fedex has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to stagnation in revenues from its express unit.
but the explosion in online shoppers salted the results of the fedex ground division.
in the last quarter, ground division revenues increased by 29%, but operational revenues effectively stalled because of higher costs for large packages and their own insurance.
the express unit has seen an increase in revenues due to higher basic tariffs, while freight division revenues have fallen due to rising costs.
in pre-market trading about an hour before the opening sound, fedex dropped $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
on tuesday, the closure dropped by 11 per cent year-on-year and 17 per cent compared to the record high on 11 june.
at the most-awaited meeting in years, policymakers within the federal reserve will spend two days this week around a mahan table with 27 feet to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
above them, at a central bank meeting, a us diral painting will be expected.
the map aims to recall that janet l. yellen, edf chairman, and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all.
the central bank has been given a dual task from congress: to maximise the employment rate in the us and to maintain price stability.
but since the great economic crisis, edf leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
and this third task could be the x factor in a decision that is too difficult to predict, to be announced on tuesday, and which will determine whether the us economy is ready to be frozen by the unprecedented stimulus provided by the almost zero short-term interest rate in force at the end of 2008.
even though most data indicate a strong growing economy, the recent agr in the global financial markets could frighten edf officials already wary of adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even by a quarter of a percentage point.
" obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects they will pursue, " said lindsey m. piegza, chief economist at brokeraj stifel nicolaus & co.
" but i think that if they were to seek an excuse not to increase interest rates, growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait any longer, " she said.
there is no consensus on the decision the edf will take, in itself causing instability in the financial market.
about half of economists recently questioned by bloomberg predicted an interest rate increase this week.
but the financial markets expect the edf to postpone, with a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
this would indicate a drop on the stock exchange if the edf increases its interest rate unless policymakers cushishithe blow by vowing to take a long time before the next growth.
on tuesday, the industrial average dow jones moved up 28.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.599.85.
the momentum was expectations that edf decision makers will maintain stable interest rates this week, said john lonski, chief economist at moody's capital markets research group.
" it would be surprising for the edf to increase its interest rate at this point in time, " lonski said.
if edf decision makers did,' they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets'.
other experts have stated that an increase in the interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty as to when the edf will act.
just a month ago, the edf seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the force of us recovery.
yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected an interest rate increase this year despite objections raised by liberals such as more economic progress is needed.
although job creation slowed in august, labour market growth was strong this year.
unemployment dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level the edf regards as full employment.
the wage gains have shown signs of growth.
and while inflation continued not to achieve the central bank's annual goal, edf decision makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices.
the economy " can cope with higher rates and needs them given tension in the labour market, " said ian shepherdson, chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics.
however, the global financial markets began entering fibrilations at the end of this month, after china devalued its currency.
dow jones industrial average dropped by 16% below the record maximum reached in may, as investors feared that a slowdown in the chinese economy would bring down world growth.
the market renoticed somewhat this month, with the dow index now standing at about 10% below the maximum in may.
for edf decision makers, market agitation is in addition to the complex calculation of times when interest rates are rising.
" without what happened on the financial markets and news about weakening the chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be more firm at the sitting, " said stephen d. oliner, an experienced researcher at ucla ziman centre for real estate and a former edf official.
now, he is expected to wait at least a month to deal with the effects better.
" there is a great deal of uncertainty as to what the impact will be on the us economy and they almost do not have data on which to rely later on events in china, " oliner said.
the well-being of the global economy is not one of the edf's major interests, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision making.
in reality, however, the edf has become the world's monetary authority.
in recent years, the central bank influence has been huge.
simply alluding by then president ben s. bernanke in 2013 that the edf could' narrow' its monetary expansion triggered the earthquake in world markets.
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly emanated, edf officials are expected not only to monitor progress made in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
his decision-making process is " more art than science, " said zachary karabell, head of the global strategy department at welfare management firm envestnet inc.
jeffrey lacker, chairman of the federal reserve bank in richmond, va., said this month that " the edf has an historic oversized reaction to changes in the financial market that appear to be unrelated to economic bases. "
lacker, a voting member of the federal open market committee, a decision-making body, which supported an increase in the interest rate, set the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
a financial crisis that has affected asia has led the edf to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, " despite implications with the possibility of limited identification for us development, " lacker said.
a year later, edf officials returned to those drops.
the edf should put financial stability first in a major crisis such as the 2008 market earthquake, said adam s. posen, a former member of the interest rate commission at the bank of england.
the last turbulent period is far short of that level, he said.
" we certainly don't want to end up in a situation to fear of an increase in the interest rate because the markets have angered, " said posen, president of the peterson institute for international economics.
the federal reserve act still holds a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes, i do not think it should take premature action.

4 people lost their lives after police fired with rubber bullets at protesters in nepal.
four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed proposed constitution, an official said on wednesday.
the violence occurred late tuesday in the rupandehi district, about 280km west of the capital of kathmandu.
bishnu prasad dhakal, head of district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, while some threw stones and molotov cocktails.
mr. dhakal said police forces used tear gas before shooting himself air before ting to the use of rubber bullets.
twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
it was not clear immediately why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
the clash came the latest after weeks of violent protests in the southern part of nepal, where members of the madhesi ethnic group say new provinces set up under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
protests also existed in western nepal, where the tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
at least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes on 10 august,
when four key political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces -- a major step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in nepal, a country centrally governed for hundreds of years.
the procedure for drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in april.
in kathathaththis week, lawmakers voted on clauses in the draft constitution, and officials said the new charter could be adopted on sunday.

weight-reducing surgery could be useful in the case of light obesity diabetiations.
the benefits of cyrilum for reducing hardship for light obesity people, with 2-type sugar diabet, could remain for at least five years, according to a new study.
it is still premature to say whether diabetes with easy obesity live more after loss-loss surgical intervention than those following unhirurgical treatments.
" it takes a long time to centralise mortality data, " said dr robin blackstone, a specialist on obesity surgery surgery, she wrote an article on the new study in jama surgery.
operations for loss of weight, named and surgery of baririca, use various methods to reduce the dental.
they reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the capacity of the body to absorb food.
over the years, barrier surgery has proved effective in the treatment of 2-type diabetes, but most studies were conducted on obesity morbida, with a 35 or higher corporate mass index (imc).
the imc, a unit of weight to weight, is considered normal in the 18.5-24.9.
the imc value of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and people with more than 30 are considered obese.
you can calculate your imc by accessing: 1 usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
for the new study, researchers at taiwan's general min-sheng hospital used data gathered after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariric - bypass gastric and gastrectomie in manson -- in medical treatment of 2-type diabes to people with easy obesity.
the imc mediu to people who suffered surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year as part of the study.
meanwhile, the imc to people who received non-hirurgical treatments against the sugar oned diabetes remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
of those who suffered surgical intervention, zaharsugar diabetes fully healed to 36% and partly to 28%.
in the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, sugar diabetes fully healed to only 1% and partly to only 2% of subjects.
in addition, arterial tension, triglicerides and lmr cholesterol " bad " were generally better in the surgical group, " the authors concluded.
researchers also monitored sangulevels in hemoglobina a1c, which reflects the secondary school level over time.
researchers write that the best level of hemoglobina a1c is below 7%.
after surgical intervention, the average level of hemoglobina a1c has dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
but in the group dealt with by medical methods, it has remained at around 8%.
but this improved glicemic control " -- reflected in improved hemoglobina a1c levels -- has not reduced the mortality rate to five years, according to chief researcher dr chih-cheng hsu and colleagues.
the research team also compared average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
in the fifth year, compared to the gastrectomo in manson, the bypass surgical task group lost more in weight (18.7 compared to 14.2 kg), registered more significant falls in the imc value (7.4% to 5.1) and hemoglobina a1c (3.1% compared to 2.1%) and presented a higher probability of the 16.7% share of sugar.
although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence in a study by high yweight people in sweden that surgical intervention extends life, says blackstone, of arizona university, the faculty of medicine - phoenix.
in the swedish study, obese people who have suffered surgery from the barrier presented a probability about 29% lower to die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit for patients who suffered surgical intervention, blackstone said it was an optimistic issue for people with imc under 35 interested in the procedure.
" this is the point where this work is critical, because it says this surgical intervention is safe in the lower imc group, " without increasing the risk of death or renal disease, she says.
blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking seriously the patient's imc reaches 27-30.
" i think we wait too long for people to take this seriously, " she said.
i believe that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have shortened their bodies by disposing them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
" it is impossible for everyone to come to europe " -- the dalai lama - rt news
europe could not receive all refugees, the dalai lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis situation lies in the middle east.
the tibetan buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the mother countries of refugees.
the dalai lama spoke about the problem of the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the dalai lama centre for compassion in oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to britain.
he said that in the current situation, human interests should prevail over the interests of each nation and even every continent.
he also stressed that while admirable, the response of western european countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
" it is impossible for everyone to come to europe, " he said in his speech.
although the dalai lama praised germany and austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed only a temporary solution.
" it is wonderful care for several thousand refugees, but we must also think about long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, to muslim countries, " he stressed.
after all, we need to think about ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
we need to reduce force use.
force never solved these problems, " he added.
on the issue of violence, the dalai lama also commented on george bush's actions following the 11 september terrorist attacks, saying the violent response from the us generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
after the events of 11 september, i expressed my condolences in a letter to president bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
i know his reasons were strong, but he used force and led to unexpected consequences, " the dalai lama said.
the four-fold increase in children who have deterred detergent hands over the last 4 years.
according to georgia's anti-poisraoning centre, us anti-poisoning centres have reported an increase of around 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed up detergent hands with high alcohol content.
according to dr gaylord lopez, director of georgia's anti-otraoning re centre, cases of inggenting hand detergents in children under the age of 12 reported at anti-otraoning centres climbed from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
" children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them reach the emergency chamber, " lopez told cnn.
lopez said some children intentionally drink detergently and others do so to impress their friends to respond to challenges on social media.
films showing teenagers showing detergently can be watched on youtube to create cheap drinks.
teenagers are said to have mixed alcohol-mouth water detergents in order to obtain a stronger drink.
younger children can be drawn to the attractive smell of detergents.
" a child does not think that he is harming them, " lopez says.
many of the most attractive types (of detergent hands) are the perfumes.
gowberhate detergents, strugure, the orange are the most attractive to children.
hands detergents contains about 45-95 per cent alcohol.
in young children in particular, only a few freeze can cause alcohol poisoning.
" it's very focused on alcohol, " dr stephen thornton, medical director of the anti-poisoning centre at the kansas university hospital, told kansas city's fox 4 channel.
thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these detergents of hands in accessible places and if the small ones reach them, this is a rapid way of consuming a lot of alcohol.
the six-year-old nhaijah russell, who recently travelled to school equivalent to four sprayers with detergent strastraal deterurbs, has reached the emergency chamber to receive treatment.
it had alcohol ia179, twice the threshold an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to dr chris ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated it at the gwinnett medical centre outside atlanta.
nhaijah balmajea and could not go when the emergency chamber arrived.
doctors monitored it overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of cerebral injuries, because the girl fell and ran into the head due to alcohol, ritchey said.
" he was frightening, " ortoria scott, nhaijah mother, told cnn.
it could have been fatal to them.
lopez urged parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or servicemen and stop leaving their-hand detergant at children.
besides alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
in 2013, two ontario women died after freeallowed ing detergent hands containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
health authorities assumed that the product contained metthanol, a lethal substance, rather than alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
in january, three fourth-class students from new york planted to poisison their professor " bad " putting anti-bacterial products in class, " according to a police report.
teacher is very allergic to detergent hands and has banned him from his room.
police considered the plan to be " insignificant " and have filed the disciplinary problem with the school inspectorate.

former rangers midfielder and former dutch international player ronald de boer said dutch football fans lost interest in celtic -- because they are not for title rangers.
by boer, currently the ambassador of ajax, said, " in the netherlands, i no longer pass on the celtic match summaries; why? "
because they are not rangers there.
here, there is not just talk of the return of rangers.
there is talk of old firm.
there is talk of both teams together, and that is where interest is heading.
tension is high in matches in old firm, and not just scots want to see the matches.
i will change the situation, deila promises.
ronny deila accepted that celtic is fighting hard, but the norwegian chief vowed to change the situation.
the defeat with malmo and the subsequent elimination from the champions league were followed by defeat to aberdeen that played in 10 people, now ahead of the five-point lead rankings.
but deila said, " celtic had periods before and they will come back. "
we want to emerge from this situation as quickly as possible.
i know it is very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what is happening.
we feel - but we need to go further.
we really need the support of celtic because that is how the players also become better.
it is extremely important for us to remain united now.
warburton caution over january transfers
despite comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he had identified several targets for january transfers, rangers chief mark warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he does not want to affect the unity of the ibrox team.

in the case of players transferred summer, there is the period before the season they can be integrated, which you could see this season in our group.
the team is doing very well.
sometimes you do more harm if you bring non-needed players.
celtic targets michu

why execution in oklahoma
later today, apart for belated legal intervention, i will look at how a man to death is sentenced.
if it happens, and i hope does not happen, i will sit in a room for observers in oklahoma's execution hall and see how richard glossip is executed by managing lethal injection.
he asked me to be one of four official death witnesses.
the invitation first came in january through his best friend, and, although i was shocked, i accepted.
as the day approaches, i am appalled the idea.
so why?
i agreed because i thought that this was a good way to tell all the story of the death penalty.
it would offer a one-off perspective.
admittedly, journalists can witness executions in america and, because applications usually go beyond the number of places available, a macabra lottery is taking place to decide who will be elected.
oklahoma reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
those elected will look at execution impartially.
i cannot.
i would stay next to richard glossip's closest friends, in addition, i have developed my own connection with him over months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
i like.
we often laugh when we speak.
prison authorities say i cannot witness journalist, so i will not be allowed to have a car and a pix with me to note what i see.
i will have to remember all the details.
a oklahoma journalist accused twitter of compromising my impartiality.
that is the lesson.
it tells the detainee's story as he wants, it gains access.
i complained about.
he acknowledged that' he could have worded better', but he still believes i am wrong.
richard glossip disagreed with some of the things i said and wrote.
he does not tell me what to write, and i would do so even if he asked me.
i told him he could remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
but he wants an international report on the subject to be present.
he believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
huffington reporter kim bellware will be with me.
if you want to find out more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that we have made.
i will not return to all details here.
i cannot say for certainty richard glossip is innocent.
his actions following the murder of barry van treese are guilty of complicity.
but i think it is likely that he will not be guilty of murder.
i certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
i think his execution is wrong.
and i will look at it by dying from this perspective.
i cannot pretend that i am totally objective.
to do so, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
from me, you will find out how it is to look at a man i like by dying unnecessarily.
peter moody claims stewares have tried to spy him, threatens to pull out of races
peter moody said stewares racing victoria tried to infiltrate a spy into his codes last year and threatened to withdraw from races immediately.
he launched an attack against stewares and the integrity department al racing victoria, saying they conduct a personal campaign against him, a drop that filled the glass being lady tatai's elimination from the race due to treatment administered on race day.
moody told fair fax media that it has always tried to do what is best for flights and in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome of the leaders' tree test, for which it has no explanation.
for 18 months he swallowed up his words about statements about spies and did not want to sole' vulpea that does not reach grapes'.
" i was not going to say anything about that and i kept quiet for a long time but sometimes you reach such a high level of frustration that everything bursts at once, " moody said.
it is known to have continued.
sometimes you react and suffer the consequences, and i will have to live with what i have said.
last night, i will go home and sleep quietly.
i want to go my heads held high and i want the owners i am working to see that i strive to give them my best.
since they start to believe that this is not the case, i have to give up on the trainer profession.
at that point, i will have to think about what i will do with my certification.
earlier, moody threw the bomb in an interview with racing.com saying the integrity department had tried to spy on its codes.
" eighteen months ago, terry bailey, dayle brown and dr brian stewart were sitting in a room together with a man -- whose name i will say if asked -- and offered to commit him to my codes to provide information about the work there, " moody told racing.com.
obviously consider me a trisor.
if so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
robert roulston, former rvl president, david moodie, current president of rvl and bernard saundry, current ceo ceo of rvl, knew at the time and i still know today.
should i think this is a personal thing?
is it necessary for the rvl to start spineless and can hold people from outside traitors for what is happening in industry?
do i have a very poor influence on the industry?
so bad is my influence on industry?
perhaps that is how i see others.
perhaps it must take me a license and give me aside, and i have no doubt that the statements they are making now could lead them to think about this.
however, i have reached the point where i no longer care, and that saddens me.
it saddens me greatly.
i will put ep pressure and make them make a decision.
my family supports me and leave.
the frustration has increased with the long-standing investigation into balbaltesting involving the leaders and the elimination led him to say he could " put his license on the table. "
moody, whose name is most often associated with training undefeated champion black caviar, labelled the race-day treatment rule " ridiculous " after applying on the feet of a bodown with namol or argila, violating the rules.
it violates flights' rules.
i have full responsibility for this, " he says.
one of my employees wrongly put namol on his leg.
it could have happened last night.
it could have happened yesterday, which happened.
it was race day.
moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment of the race day of the applause, for which stewares opened an investigation.
a joke.
people making these rules know nothing about horses.
" we all understand that the rules are needed, but it went too far, " moody said.
driver who hit, fled site of the accident in cobram arrested
police arrested a man after a collision with a bicicist produced in cobram at the weekend and followed by fleeing the accident site.
the cycliist was transported by helicopter to the royal melbourne hospital, seriously injured after being hit early saturday by a car on the murray valley highway.
police representatives say the driver of the car did not stop to help the injured cycliist.
on monday, a 50-year-old man turned himself in to the police in shepparton.
he is said to be charged with fleeing from the scene of the accident, not providing the first help and other road crimes.
the cycliist, a 40-year-old man, from cobram, remains admitted in stable condition.
coach melbourne storm craig bellamy responds to opponents in wrestling charges.
coach melbourne storm, craig bellamy, criticism of his team's plates tactics as " distorted topics " raised by the two main favourites in nrl.
coach sydney roosters trent robinson said the referees storm players to " take them to tranta " the team won storm nervous match in the qualification final in sydney late friday.
brisbane broncos coach, wayne bennett, made a slight reference to storm after his team's victory in the north queensland cowboys qualifying match late saturday when he called the match a " demonstration " of the rugby league and said the two queensland teams were not enough in wrestling.
bellamy jumped in defence of the placcal tactics addressed by his team and said the players simply focused on " contact " when they liked.
bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticised his team, which means they were worried that storm would defeat them.
" things don't stop there, too -- i didn't hear trent robinson to complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2, " bellamy said on wednesday.
i can guarantee that we have changed nothing all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so only as in the last six weeks have we really emphasised contact in the plates and so we have changed the situation.
trent has been in office for three years and obviously has a wonderful team, so it is probably not used to losing and was a shock to him.
we know how is always the case during this period of year.
bellamy disted bennett's idea of " animating football, " recalling bennett's mentor george-illawarra dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing " boring " football.
wayne talks about exciting football.
he argued his opinion comparing his game late saturday with our game friday evening and talked about how exciting the game was, " bellamy said.
i remember that in 2010, st george received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team, and wayne said he was neither interested in how black under the angle.
but it now has a team that can play what we would consider to be palrilling football, particularly because of the fast young midfielders.
this kind of game do you want to do it when you have such players.
he made that argument in 2010, he now wants everyone to take their playing field -- not any team has two midfielders like anthony milford and ben hunt so that they can play so.
it gives me more confidence because they are saying this because they are somewhat concerned about the match with us.
six weeks ago, they probably did not think of us when they were thinking of the major matches.
bellamy also pointed out that the match between storm and roosters was a sharp score score compared to the broncos match and cowboys.
the match of the broncos was probably a good match, did we not see it yet, how much was 16-12?
our match ended 20-18, were there two more attempts in our game, does that mean exciting game?
or does the palrilling mean making breaks and not marking?
there are plans.
if i am talking about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home either with north queensland cowboys, or with cronulla sharks, in next saturday's pre-trial final in aami park, with tickets on go for sale starting next morning.

hewlett-packard to make 30,000 layoffs
hewlett-packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 redundancies as part of the company's restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the services sector.
this year, the hp will split into two companies, separating the computer division and immune from corporate hardware operations and lightning services.
the expected layoffs will cost about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, the hp said.
" these restructuring will bring new hewlett packard enterprise a more competitive and sustainable structure in terms of costs, " said meg whitman, president and director of the hp, who will lead the unit after the split.
" hewlett packard enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current hp and will have a broad business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of firms to the new style of business, " whitman said.
operating as a separate society, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing requirements of our customers worldwide.

the move taken by the hp, the world's second largest computer producer and one of the largest us technology companies, is the latest in this area, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in one direction are performing better.
friendsfest: the comedy series that has taught us important lessons about male friendship.
the absence of similar figures in the series is obvious, as the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with rates of suicide among young men reaching the peak of the past 15 years.
in 2013, the suicide was the main cause of death among 20-45 men in britain, and remains three times more frequent for men than in women.
in a bid to address the problem, the campaign against unfortunate life (living miserably (calm) named 2015 the year of the man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
friendship is at the heart of the fight for this challenge to succeed.
a recent study conducted on more than 2 000 high school students showing symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by quite many friends " with a healthy state of provision, " his chances of recovery double.
similarly, for people who are not suppressed, a circle of mental healthy friends halves the probability of mental disorders emerging.
of course, in order for friendship to have an effect, it must, first and foremost, be accessible.
in this era of the communication dominated by social media, where emphasis is placed on style and not on substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes priority before meaningful contact.
our digital lives have doubled the need to create the apparent appearance of a strong, open to fun and successful figure, even though it is actually isolation that dominates.
this superficial success is dominated by what the psychologists call extrinsecc values; money, the image, social status, all at the cost of the intrinsic values - our internal desire for personal development and friendship - which is even more damaging to our mental health.
the billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that the money really does not buy happiness.
the beauty of serious friends was to focus attention on the idea.
the characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
the humour of the frequent reasons of joey and chandler, when he looks at football in the convenient seats and passion of ross for his missiles came from the fact that it is known that men can associate themselves with this situation, even though they often thered to completely explore their feelings.
as a social worker explained to me:'... my role in listening to people with a suicide and depressed trend has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference'.
often, the people who appeal to us do not feel able to speak to friends.
his old saying alone is strong, as is the feeling of perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
friends are one of the series that come to mind when i try to provide more psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long term.
the series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
however much helps objective, outside intervention, via telephone, people ended up in times of desperation, long-term support comes from the family and close friends.
thus, if you participate in friendsfest organised by the central comedy this weekend, with the complete drafting of filming platforms to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to coffee in central perk.
or, better still, if you see someone alone in starbucks, smiled and greetings.
you never know what your friendship could make.
friends are aired on central comedy from the beginning to the end -- all 236 episodes -- at hook friendsfest.
di maria marks, helps bsp set aside
angel di maria celebrates blaise matuidi and edinson cavani after marking malmo.
angel di maria marked her debut champions league match on tuesday and helped the bsp bsp appear before the swedish team malmo.
we are still presenting your match chronic and your response to the game.
angel di maria and edinson cavani did their job, paris saint-germain starting with a series of champions league group matches, with a reassuring 2-0 victory over malmo in a match played on the des printi park on tuesday.
di maria marked less than four minutes after her debut match in the bsp champions league began, bringing france's champions into advantage although they missed a number of opportunities before securing their advantage with the kani's goal in the 61st minute.
reaching group a with real madrid and sahtior donetk, paris needed a strong start against the swedish champions because the french team's goal is not only to qualify for optimround but also an improvement in the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
but although they took the points, laurent blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with zlatan ibrahimovic, who wasted the goal opportunity before being replaced by the team in his hometown and the club to which he began brillibrillicareer in 1999.
" it is not easy to win at home or travel to the champions league, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable difference from the next classes, even though there are still issues we need to improve during the season, " blanc says.
this is a good sign.
we wanted to win and did so, although i am sorry that we did not manage to give one or two more goals.
ibrahimovic returned after accidto one of three changes to the team in paris, with a 2-2 milestone obtained at home by borghex in the 1st league at the weekend, but a di maria took light on the spotlight in the fourth minute.
when he was transferred from manchester united last month, argentine offensive midfielder was appointed the man who will take the bsp to the next level in europe and demonstrated this when he tasared in marco verratti's care behind malmo's defence before he shot incredibly over johan wiland, in the long corner on the right of the gate.
but if anyone expected the bsp to win victory by mering from fingers, they were disappointed.
malmo, who defeated celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national team holders, a defence from five people and two defensive midfielders, was a strong adversary.
but their attack was not impressive, with the exception to nikola djurdjic, who passed through kevin trapp's post in the 34th minute.
instead, the bsp players slowed the pace several times, giving some unnecessary and not completing the interventions, even ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then replaced by kghts even after the game resumed.
but ibrahimovic proved much more skilled in supporting his colleagues, with his care the one maria sent to a sut devited across the gate in the 52nd minute.
the second goal was scored at the end of the day after an hour broke out of the match, thanks to cavani, uruguayan who scored the sixth season goal after ibrahimovic walked out of maxwell's belt.
that goal removed the hope in malmo that they would rebalance the score and only a superstop by wiland from a distance to david luiz retained the final score before the new entry of equiel lavezzi is cancelled a goal in extensions.
the team's norwegian coach in malmo, chaid age, later said the bsp was a fish class and that " the last match we played in the champions league was in december last year. "
since then, we have only played in the swedish league, which is not up to the same level.
qualifications are not enough.
below the palace for the bsp.
they made an excellent game.

more than 100 stewardese fired for too fat
air india discharges about 130 stewares and stewardese for being overweight weight, the company announced late last week.
the state company announced that the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move " ridiculous " and " shocksexists, " writes the washington post.

the weight limit for them dates back to the 1980s, when air india started using ideal weight and graphics.

although the 35-year-old man was saying he had not consumed alcohol, it was visible that he was in ebriety.
when he first accused me of being drunk without drank, i thought it was mad.
" but friends and the family thought' maybe they drink alone, it's one alcoholic in secret', " he recounts, according to mirror.
when he saw his wife shooting with him, the man in columbus, ohio simply did not recognise admitted: " i look in my eyes and i was not there. "
'it was appalling, remember nothing'.
in addition, his wife, who, although he doubted some while of him, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that nick mirosea smell of alcohol as well.
the moment that made nick the most was when, after a minor accident when it was hit by another car, it was discovered that she had three times above legally limred alcohol, although one evening it had never consumed just one beer.
after years and non-number investigations, it was found that nick suffers from an extremely rare disease, " self-brewery syndrome. "

the government approved on wednesday the " national immigration strategy for the period 2015-2018 " and the " action plan for the current year, " documents considered to be " another step romania is taking as part of efforts to modernise the immigration management process within national territory, " according to a press release.
the quoted source shows that the strategy aims to manage immigration effectively, including strategic objectives in general, specific objectives and courses of action that reflect policies established at european level adapted to national realities.
in view of the problems faced by states in the immediate vicinity of romania, measures are being envisaged for the unified and coherent management of situations resulting from the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants into romanian territory, resulting in crisis situations of a political, social, economic or military nature.
" the romanian authorities will help create a flexible admission system but, at the same time, they will pay particular attention to citizens from states with potential migratory potential or who can harm national security, " the aforementioned source adds.
the strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in syria, re-activating the conflict in iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the outlying areas of romania (ukraine, transnistria), perpetuating and growth in intensity of the israeli-palestinian armed conflict.
on the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic objectives relating to immigration, such as: the promotion of legal migration, more rigorous controls on the residence of third-country nationals in romanian territory, and the proper application of removal measures and restrictive measures, the improvement of the national asylum system.
the national strategy also contains specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of general strategic objectives.
these include: facilitating access to the romanian territory of third nationals who meet employment needs, favouring access for third-country nationals to higher education institutions in romania for the areas and professions identified as lacking.
with regard to the 2015 action plan, the government appreciates it as' a means of setting out concrete activities leading to creating a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon'.

latvia, romania and bulgaria saw the greatest increase in the total cost of labour among european union member states in the second quarter of the year, compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published by the european statistical office (eurostat) on wednesday.
the index is about employers' staff.
thus, between april and june 2015, the total labour cost increased by 1.9% in the european union and 1.6% in the euro area.
romania ranks third in eu labour costs
biggest increases were reported in latvia (7.9%), romania (7.7%), bulgaria (6.8%), estonia (5.5%) and lithuania (4.3%).
the only eu states where the labour cost fell in the second quarter this year were greece (minus 2.9%), cyprus (minus 1.2%) and italy (minus 0.4%).
advancing labour costs in romania from april to june 2015 is mainly due to an increase in labour costs in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
in the construction sector, romania registered a 5.8 per cent lead in labour costs.
activity report by the tvr leadership, rejected in committees: stelian tanase risks dismissal
parliament's culture committees on wednesday rejected an activity report by the governing board of the romanian television company for 2014.
rejecting the report voted 17 lawmakers, one against rejection (senator varujan vosganian) and one abstained.
the text of the report will be submitted to the permanent offices brought together.
they will probably decide next week.
at the next joint house, it will be debated.
" i think that given this situation will be done relatively quickly, " said senate culture committee president georgica severin.
he added that " it was common sense " for the tvr leadership to also be present at the meeting, as no representatives of the tvr leadership were present at the meeting of the culture committees.
it was common sense that tvr leadership because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like this.
the invitation came to members like last night, with an approximating hour that we did not know hour either, but today after the joint office meeting, i personally sent a fax to the helm of the tvr inviting it.
i believe that when you are called, you are a budget employee, paid from public taxes and are called for a joint committee meeting even if you do not like it alive.
" because it is your obligation for service, you are in an institution subordinate to parliament, " severin said after a meeting of parliament's joint culture committee.
he added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the budget committees at the meeting.
debts also saw how they continued, came up with the idea that this year it would have been up to date, but were not paid from the historical ones.
" i remind you that it is not through my fault or anyone else in these committees that leisure was lost with the banks and taxation, there are clear management problems, " severin added.
he added that once the activity report has been rejected by the joint plenary, elections will follow for a new board of directors, and it would elect the institution's director-general.
i do not know who will be proposed for this.
miners will not.
what is important is for political decisions to be made in order for this institution to function.
i am not the man to lie to you, tell you that there will be a genius who will queue here and beat ck.
i hope that those who decide, parliament's plenary, with their vote will choose with great reason the people who will lead the tvr.
there must be people who know what is happening there, have experience and have a great deal of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
i do not know who will be, if you ask me what quality they have to have - common sense towards employees because it is a maldar of petitions coming from employees, complaints, redundancies.
" when you get such complaints 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster, " the chairman of the senate culture committee concluded.
while not present in parliament, tvr r director-general stelian tanase sent a letter to president of the chamber of deputies valeriu zgonea calling for parliament to consider a series of measures that could lead to saving and guaranteeing the economic and political independence of public television, including tv tax indexation.
in the letter, stelian tanase asks, in addition to the tv tax indexation, amending and completing hg 978 / 2003 on the tax on public television service, in order to update provisions at the level of daily technological change, as well as for regulating the control procedure in the payment of tv tax, and the finding of offences, and applying sanctions and penalties.
he also wants to issue a provision providing for extending the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become srtv mandations for collecting tv tolls by involving anre in regulating this activity.
in his opinion, a maximum ceiling of 5% of collection fees needs to be set.
stelian tanase is demanding a reduction in the vat rate for activities specific to public television station and the contribution to the cnc from 15% to 3%, but also changes to law 41 / 1994, in terms of the possibility of receiving budget / financing allocations to purchase licenses for major cultural and sports events -- the world football championship, the golden g, eurovision.
he claims that srtv will default in the coming months given that labour law obliges the employer to implement court rulings, even if they are not final, and wage rights honour themselves as a priority over any other obligation.
the tvr administration has been making constant efforts to cut m spending on personnel and tv production.
" this has reduced travel and other cost-generating activities, a number of commercial contracts have been renegotiated, and in late july the tvr news station was closed, " president tvr's letter said.
young men appreciate that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied by their own efforts alone.
" without the support of state institutions -- the government, parliament, the presidency -- romanian television will, sooner or later, be unable to carry out its public mission, " the letter noted.
the chamber of deputies leadership decided to send the letter to the committee of culture.

" in fact, fictitious service purchases, which were not provided in the company's accounting, would have been registered, with the state budget thus costing around 600,000 euros, " romanian police explained in a press release.

barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will just show that in hungary, at the heart of europe, political decision makers with nothing better than those in syria, libya or other countries from which those refugees!
" i believe in solidarity, in sensible and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of european values -- what we see in recent days in hungary runs completely counter to precisely these goals and values! " " the head of the romanian executive stressed.
earlier on tuesday, hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto described " mere lies " romanian prime minister victor ponta's remarks about hungary's management of the refugee crisis, describing the claims as inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to the mmti.
the head of hungarian diplomacy also noted on tuesday that the romanian prime minister's " extremist and false remarks " contain the domestic political crisis in romania, and made it clear that budapest apologises from the romanian side.
szijjarto referred to a statement monday by prime minister victor ponta.
what i have said, and i always say is that i am against xenophobic speeches to close borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are middle nonsense nonsense and i am totally opposed to this approach.
if we can receive more, we will receive it, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not as they treat our hungarian neighbours, with cudgks and the series.
" that's what i disagree with, " the head of the romanian executive, said at a press conference in targu-jiu.
also on tuesday, peter szijjarto announced that budapest has decided to start preparations on the ground for expanding the romanian border of the fence building on the border with serbia, to deal with any change in the route used by migrants.
later, prime minister victor ponta said hungary's decision to raise a border fence resolves nothing of the refugee problem and " takes hungary out of europe. "
link between osama bin laden and collapse of mecca cranes
saudi authorities have announced that saudi giant binladin group, belonging to osama bin laden's family, is " partly responsible " for the collapse of a crane on friday at the great mosque in mecca, an accident that left 107 people dead.
according to an investigative committee, the company failed to " comply with safety standards, " saudi news agency (spa), the bbc reported.
company executives have been barred from leaving the country until the investigation is completed into the case.
the firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
the construction firm is owned by the family of former al-qaeda terrorist network leader osama bin laden.
the company was founded by osama bin laden's father 80 years ago and is currently headed by the former terrorist leader's brother bakr.
binladen group has been working on the expansion of large mosques for 4 years so that it can host several pilgrims.
the accident occurred during a storm late friday, when a crane, possibly unbalanced by strong wind shelves, crashed on the eastern part of the large mosque roof in mecca.
as a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
how the haghaghagpieces close their mouth of appeals
widely considered romania's biggest footbalplayer in history, gica hagi was labelled, after stepping out of work, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to perform performances in the new position as well.
after unfortunate experiences with the national team, star or galatasaray, hagi took over the coaching role in the constant future, his team a year ago.
fixed a year after assuming the team, the king demonstrated that he is capable of turning a team struggling to save from downgrading to a top one.
thus, a year later, the future registered, with hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 mismisery and 11 defeats.
the balance sheet is one of a top team, beating european cups.
things took an even better turn for the future this season, as the team finished second with 19 points, one less than the leader astra giurgiu.
the future also has the best attack in the 1st league, with 20 goals (on par with astra), more than double than the star.
on the other hand, even though he brought several experienced players to the team, hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and names recently such as ianis hagi or hodorogea appeared on the start team.
club policy made the future a team to watch for teams abroad, so hagi 1.5m euros this summer -- ianis hagi (fiorentina-1m euros) and alexandru mitrita (bari - 500 thousand euros).
along with the star, the future is the only profitable team in league 1, according to trade registry data.
in the refugee crisis, romania has so far played as a small country.
it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask being treated as the seventh eu country.
large countries come up with solutions for the entire eu, says cristian ghinea, a member of the executive college of the romanian european policy centre.
in an interview with ziare.com, cristian ghinea showed that europe cannot be turned into a fortress and purely police means will not work in this crisis: " maybe we have doubts about the quality of values these people come with. "
but there are masses that started and we cannot return history.
migration is a reality that we need to adapt to as well as possible and adapt them to us.
in cristian ghinea's view, we are at an extremely emotional time when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
once he has passed, europeans will not be willing to give up freedom of movement, but the rules in the schengen area must be changed: " schengen is now like an animal being created in another age and which was not adapted to the situation now. "
where are we in refugee crisis after this jha council which has, in fact, solved nothing?
it is clear that ec president in agreement with donald tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
all the predictions were saying that they would have had the necessary votes.
before the treaty of lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in the jha and any state could block any decision.
that is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
after lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the ec has the initiative, and the council approves it with the vote of 55% of states, or 16, accounting for 65% of the eu population.
calculations said votes existed.
but they did not want to move forward.
as this is a sensitive issue, reactions of rejection arose in germany itself against chancellor merkel's opening policy and did not want it to appear in many countries such as an' eu is sending us migrants to our head' response.
they have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave is creating a huge problem for schengen governance and we will probably see great changes there in the coming period.
so mandatory quotas have not really been eliminated, but has the subject just been left before?
yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement by frontex in managing external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are on the external border of schengen to the responsibility of community agencies.
greece's border with turkey is also germany's border with turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has set the limits to the old schengen system.
perhaps the dublin principle will be waived that migrants are the responsibility of the state in which they enter the first time, because it is unsustainable.
if greece falls, you cannot say forever that it is greece's job.
the problem.
precisely because the problem is common, is it possible to resolve without a precise, perhaps even binding, mechanism for sharing the reception effort?
no one knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work, if they are to be reached.
because a problem remains: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to romania or portugal, but to sweden or germany?
i do not believe that they will press on the european states to take migrants upwards: you go to country x or to the y country.
some single filtering centres will probably reach greece or turkey, where asylum applications can be processed.
work is being done on solutions such as this.
but the problem does not have a simple resolution.
there are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without any experience, like romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic trend.
the fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in turkey, lebanon, jordan, who sit in precarious camps and have only just begun to leave for europe.
an estimate says only 10% went to leave, winter is hard to cross the mediterranean, but we expect an perhaps even larger wave next year.
what are we doing with the people of them?
my nonsense is that we will get used to this issue, we will no longer look at it so catastrophic.
you were talking about countries with less or greater experience.
does there seem to you any place where it really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-european culture?
i look at the maghreb in france, at turks in germany, they are also divided.
i would not go to any radical statements.
of course their integration is more difficult than other migration waves, but this does not mean that it does not integrate at all.
it has remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in france, germany, the united kingdom.
but purely police means will not work.
let us fortress europe is illusory.
it must be tailored to integration mechanisms in european societies.
there were mistakes.
we must be demanding.
ask these people to learn the language, try to take on values, stop remaining on foot in europe and one to their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family, including through marriages of convenience.
however, the impending issue of these people needs to be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
if others have failed in long-term integration, it does not mean that we must look at them how they drowning in the mediterranean.
perhaps we have doubts about the quality of values these people come with.
and if there is an intervention in syria, which i do not think, does not mean that the country will recover overnight and take them back.
until solutions emerge, we see fortress within europe.
borders have been closed, walls are raised, border controls are reintroduced within the schengen area.
is the european project?
the european project as such no, the schengen area as built, yes.
it was built quite minimal and arranging the rules, so pressure was too high on countries they put these migrants for the first time.
that is to say, we are moving freely and there, but everyone is with their problems.
this cannot in the face of such a wave, because some countries are not coping.
when there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show they are doing something, but much is changing in the long term.
after the attacks in france, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the eu than we had last year.
it is a wave of public emotion in both ways.
and it is so unstable from one week to next that you cannot make decisions on it.
we have a lot of talking, many rebellion statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virals.
and then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in turkey and public opinion is emotional.
after public emotion, we will return to the reasons why we created this area, this freedom of movement which is not only for people, but also for goods.
this is the real single european market.
and i do not think that europeans will give up this principle of libertats of movement.
there will be other rules is something else.
schengen is now like an animal created in another age and which was not adapted to the situation at the moment.
romania how has it played in this crisis so far?
as a small country, which believes that, if it pulls a soap on the eye and uues its ears, the subject is disappearing.
faced with the reality of waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it is not your small country problem.
that is what we have done, it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
you are not, not at high country level.
large countries come up with solutions for the entire eu, good or bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
as poland.
on the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that romanians' appetite for schengen will fall greatly.
president iohannis says it is good that we have not already entered.
we are therefore moving from dispersing entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
there is, of course, a risk whether romania and bulgaria enter schengen that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
this does not mean that it is a reason not to enter schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
romania will be part of schengen, and schengen will exist, but turned into the sense that external borders will become shared responsibility, there will be single rules for the acceptance of migrants, single deportation rules for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
the ukrainian president said that after russia moved syria to ukraine, no one died.
is there a link between the two, a russian game?
russia behaves frustrated power.
she believes being great power means incurring americans and europeans.
from this point of view, yes, there is a link.
without the regime's military and financial effort, the assad regime would probably have collapsed.
and it was good to collapse before his main opponent was islamic.
for a two years has been a battle between the assad regime and moderate secular and muslim militias, supported by the gulf and western countries.
then the islamic state was raised and now we no longer know whether we want the assad regime to fall.
russia was able to complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
it creates breaks of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
but you are only great power if you have solutions.
off-side game is just a strategy for time.
he is unlikely to expect bids to be made, to press the barons to resolve the situation.
offers do not come because the world is not convinced it can solve one way or another issues he also creates.
but i disagree with the theories that say these people are driven by an invisible hand.
let us not see a little stronger than.
what buton is expected to appear soon
millions of facebook users have become used to the " like " button, and now social networking representatives are preparing another opposite, " dislike. "
on tuesday, mark zuckerberg, a co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on his account that this button will soon be available, the new york times reported on the blog.
zuckerberg said that the' dislike' button will show a nuance of what a user feels rather than an option.
however, his announcement raised the issue that facebook could become a less friendly place.
zuckerberg noted that he wants to avoid a time when someone posts on his account an important event in life and someone else will give " dislike. "
users of the network, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long called for the opportunity to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
mark zuckerberg also said that it is not very comfortable for people to give' like' to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a death of a family member.
" you may not feel comfortable to like that post, " the facebook representative noted.
a new facebook button option has not been well received by everyone.
" there is already enough hatred on facebook and social networking networks, " atiq haneef of afghanistan commented on the new york times facebook page, where the article on this subject was posted.
" i will give' dislike' to the' dislike' button', " he added.
roger anderson, a microbiologist from atlanta, claimed there is nothing wrong with the button, encouraging people to differ differently on facebook.
debra aho williamson, social media analyst with emarketer, noted that it is hard to imagine that a single button can send a complex range of negative emotions.
moreover, she says, the election campaign in america is approaching, and the " dislike " button would create a complete disaster.
only 70 refugees enter 24 hours
hungary accepted only 70 migrants on tuesday, a handful of thousands who came en masse to its southern border with serbia, government adviser gyorgy bakondi announced.
hungary declared a state of emergency later in the day in two counties along its border with serbia, due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing and announcing that it would build a fence on its border with romania, the dpa recalls.
the move, which drew a sharp reaction from serbia.
just yesterday, they said that the border logo for those who want to cross, but not for those wishing to seek asylum.
" as you can see, this is totally different, " said serbian minister for refugees aleksandar vulin.
before imposing new immigration legislation, a record 5,809 migrants entered hungary on sunday, police announced on monday.
in addition, more than 170,000 immigrants from the middle east and africa entered hungary from serbia in 2015.
many avoid being registered and are trying to reach the west, especially in germany.
the " new " headquarters of the county council is to be typical.
two insolvency
the massive investments made here in recent years to move the institution are to break apart because they have been stopped several times.
two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during work.
street county council headquarters vasile alecsandri will end up tearing down alone.
a year and a half after the consolidation and re-functionalisation of the building should have been completed, work has not reached a half.
a last stage in the building era was consumed when the national dispute resolution council (cnsc) rejected a complaint by the firm, that wanted to take over a contract to draft the technical project for work still to be carried out.
the initial project was drawn up by impex romcatel sa.
following the builder's insolvency entry and interruption of the work, negotiation procedures were launched without the publication of an announcement of participation with impex romcatel, with the firm expected to update the technical project and a new tender for works will then be held.
" but the negotiations were not concluded with a contract, with the cj describing the proposed form would have put the institution at a disadvantage, " public relations representative razvan timofciuc of the cj.
the cj's decision to suspend direct negotiations was attacked in court by impex romcatel.
the emerging tribunal sent its complaint to the cnsc, which rejected it, as a belar.
but that does not mean that the cj can start seeking another design.
impex romcatel has the opportunity to attack the cnsc's decision at the appeals court, only after a final ruling by it could it be possible to find another project.
thus, work to strengthen the building could resume early next year.
our intention is to restart work as soon as possible.
in principle, restoring the technical project should not take a long time, but we must reach a contract.
" we are waiting to see whether or not the cnsc decision will be attacked, " timofciuc said.
work on strengthening the former headquarters of police quaestors began in 2011.
a first works contract was terminated in april 2012, after 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
the tender resumed, with the contract to moldovan moldova.
the firm went into insolvency, however, with the contract terminated after 1.5 million lei had been made.
the work has so far been carried out about 50%.
initially, consolidation, re-functionalisation and mandation of the building had been assessed at 7.7 million lei.
" ready, i say! " -- a statement that could criminalise the former cadastre head.
one of the employees involved in the scandalous file at the cadastre office signed an agreement to recognise the facts, against prison with postponement.
his statements will most likely criminalise other indictees, led by former head narciza nedelcu
an adviser to the cadastre office and real estate advertising office (ocpi), accused by the dna in a corruption file, recognised her faf.
an agreement on recognition of the facts signed by dumitru dascalu was registered yesterday at the iasi tribunal, with judges setting out a solution in the case on september 29th.
dumitru daniel dascalu was accused with false intellectual intellectual in the continued form and agreed to execute delayed chişinău for two years, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
as for dascalu's imputfacts, prosecutors made it clear that he, as an adviser to the cadastre office, along with other colleagues, " drew up in falsely several minutes of accepting ants, prs want contracts for provide services in cheiearlier by o.c...p.iasi with company managers of gauss srl, sc and five euro scs.
past days, former office head narciza nedelcu, but also other former or current icc employees have been tried on the dossier, with charges of services to the firms mentioned, although work has not been done.
the judiciary exceeds 300,000 lei.
stone adventures
in president frh's view alexandru dedu, romania can only host a major handball competition in 2024, and preparing the women's handball qualifying team for the olympic games costs a fortune.
romanian handball federation president alexandru dedu said at a meeting with the media yesterday, that it is great pride that our country has three teams in champions league groups.
as for romania's national women's handball team, " the main goal is to qualify for the rio olympics, but for that it needs to go through two stages of cauwives, firstly, the world championship and secondly the pre-qualification tour, " dedu also said.
we very much want to qualify for the olympic games.
these are fantastic technical relay requirements led by tomas ryde.
the staf, which will include seven or eight people.
he wants second coach, a doctor, two masses, coach of portals, a physical preparation, head of delegation.
they have asked us to obtain the qualifications of some things, namely materials for physical training, which we have never heard.
that was all to reach olympic games; and i will do everything for me to have them.
this is massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
but that is the way forward.
because we are currently in the stone with preparation.
" the teams we are struggling with have these materials and have them for some time, " said dedu, who noted he is trying to get the amounts needed to buy these products from mts and cosr.
president frh also referred to romanian infrastructure and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
we do not have the chamber in bucharest.
it is an infrastructure problem and it is shameful to call into question a european gymnastics championship.
let us not forget that olympic neighbourhoods have been built in other parts of the world in its entirety within two years.
before 1992, in barcelona's current olympic area, it was a landdump, and now it has reached a milestone of beauty.
the same was the case in london, where the organisation of the 2012 olympics was also a success in terms of investment.
" in my view, in 2024 we can host a major competition, " dedu added.
he added that international handball bodies are willing to give romania major competition.
it is a priority for me to bring major handball competitions to romania.
mr gatu went in a civilised with a project, people gave their consent in principle, but it made it clear very quickly that the chamber would never be built.
i, too, had talks with ehf, told them that we want, that we are able to organise and said they agree and invite them to the first match in the new hall in bucharest and then talk in concrete terms.
" so we have all openness, in ehf and ihf, but we don't have the infrastructure, " the frh official explained.
the former major handball player avoided assessing the chances of the women's csm bucharest and hcm baia mare teams of finally reaching four: " i called on all coaches to be reserved in prostitions, that if they do not turn against them. "

14 million lions given to st. spiridon " hospital in iasi for amending budget
what will be purchased with this important amount of money?
the " st. spiridon " hospital was received from the health ministry following budget amendments, about 14 million lei.
the money the medical unit has received to use by the end of the year will be invested in modernising and planning clinics, but also in machinery and medical equipment for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograf computer with a new radiology apparatus, with six trks used for surgical interventions, six properly equipped beds, oftalmogic microscope and other appliances needed to conduct the medical act.

the hell, made a laughing stock of ratp controllers and a sleent.
tourist skine
a family of cluj tourists came to iasi to visit him, but the trip ended in a bitter promise.
after experienced experience, my wife does not want to calm any again in your city either.
without wishing, they were hit by the erroneous information, by of heapt controllers and, bonus bonus, by a fine' like the law'.
husbands arrived in iasi several days ago, stayed at a hotel in the centre and asked for tourist tourist fluts.
they also received a dreadful where ratp trails were passed.
" armed " with these maps, the husbands visited madeira.
but two days ago, in copou, they wanted to go to palas mall.
as it was not ticket ticket in the station near copou park, they were based on printed information leaflets: that they can take a ticket via sms.
nobody told them that this service no longer exists.
confident in the field, they climbed into a bus and tried to send sms after instructions from the horets.
unfortunately for them, a team of ratp controllers.
they said there has not been the service for 2 years now and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
where to know what was written in the local press coming an evening before visiting the city?
i spoke to controllers, i explained their situation, they did not care, that is not their job.
the attitude has been very defiant.
they said that all they can do is divert one fine instead of 2 (i and the wife).
" i paid, i did not want to shout my day of visiting at the gendarmerie and making statements there! " ovidiu counts.
in conclusion, the family was amended because of the erroneous information and controllers who' applied the law in blood'.
that is not right, and i made a complaint to ratp iasi in order to recover my money.
it is not a question of money, there are not excessively many, but the point is that i felt deceived.
ghinion for rapists in vaslui.
accident, under preventive arrest
the trial of the seven rapists in vaslui has moved to the iasi appeals court since yesterday.
emerging magistrates tried the first term at an unpublic meeting in which the seven young people accused of mounking an 18-year-old woman demanded that they be released.
before the actual start of the trial, one of the emerging judges who had been assigned the file, viorel munteanu, filed a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
the magistrate activated until this year's summer at the vaslui court, where he was president of the nale section, the one who, on 9 9th, admitted a challenge filed by four of the defendants, with them being placed under house arrest.
currently, the file is being tried by a complete including magistrates mythical telu and geta sandu.
previously, in the dossier, he formulated a abstention and judge dan an ton, on the grounds that his daughter was in a relationship with competition with one of rapists' lawyers.
the two judges ruled that vaslui rapists remain under preventive arrest.
ti nuds will remain imprisoned for at least another 30 days, when jucrs rediscuss the possibility of free them.
the trial-in-chief will take place at the iasi appeals court on 6 october.
before reaching the iasi, duba appeals court with which rape from vaslui were transported was involved in an accident in the pacurari neighbourhood, with the car entering iasi on the belt.
autoutilitara iveco car with which the seven rapists were transported hit a volks wagen car that walks off the dela dela sing, and the driver tried to viviate on the left.
duba circulates from late foetings.
the car entered iasi here because prison administration employees preferred the route from vaslui to iasi to bars, then on the ring road.
they have thus shortened the road by a few kilometres.
immediately after the impact, the arrested escort called another transport to take over detainees.
shortly after, at the scene of the accident, a car was sent from iasi maximum safety penitentiary, who took over the seven detainees and transported them to the appeals court.
following the accident, none arrested were injured.
to transfer them to the other dub, the guards surrounded the back side of the monks, and arrests came in speed, two each.
" the incident was not reported to the police because do ua car drivers amicably about the damage to be paid, " said chief commissioner madalin taranu of ipj.

romania is neither, nor will it be prepared for what to come.
?
i say this from the outset, loud and clear: neither the 7 000 refugees they should and must naturalise to romania are, in itself, an insignificant, but huge number compared to the ability of the romanian state to manage such a project.
for romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by bucharest, worth around 1 500 soul, far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the european union expressed in recent months.
certainly, if those migrants really accept establishing our locations, the chances of integrating them quickly into romanian society are extraordinarily slim.
i am convinced they will be the first to lose patience.
paralysed by mobsters and paralysed by a venal political class, the romanian state is proving mired in all areas.
failure to integrate gypsies is just a trivial example.
in addition, governments of any colour have not been able to absorb european funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, ensure decent healthcare, raise the stakes on the street, create honourably paid jobs or preserve their own young generation at home.
why would refugees be established in another country from which they are running away?
but what causes much wonder is particularly the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt with.
we first strike against the rebellion facarity of the strong eu states, which show utmost generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
then there is the cold hypocrisy of romanians who, although they have millions of dispertered relatives around the world, do not yet accept the other - on a other language, of religion, blood.
perhaps for fear of stealing them into their national being.
after all, there is also hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for departure, do not accept another destination for exodus than germany or the northern countries.
not all refugees, however, are syrian and there is not a war in pakistan.
the simplistic way in which the crisis is being looked at can also only be mocked.
the causes must be eliminated, some argue and, squabbling strictly on the book of political correctness, they call for peace and investment for migrants' countries of origin.
but in romania e peace and even enters, from time to time, some foreign capital into the national economy -- but that does not prevent tens of thousands of romanians from leaving their country every year.
why are they?
in this crisis, the european union has been revealed to us that heavy construction, torn apart and overtaken by the situation.
we deplore the fact that romania is unable to invent a country project, but here the eu does not have any future plan either.
and improvisation and threats do not help anything.
what is the eu still using, then, if the only advantage romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be called into question because of the waves of refugees crossing borders as through cheese?
once the war in syria will end.
it is not the crisis of migrants, however.
in the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc., will push millions of desperate migrants, from asia, and particularly from africa, towards a better life.
with such politicians, romania is neither, nor will it ever be prepared for what to come.

two tomato brothers have swallowed ed citers.
taken to hospital
two 9-year-old children and 11 from tomesti, brothers, swallowed up several diepo pills.
they found home pastilleries and took them out of their curiosity.
their mother was treated and medicines were not hidden.
the children were urgently taken to the " saint maria " hospital in iasi.
they are stable, as doctors say.
exclusively: a meeting that breaks your heart.
20 years received but courageous: biological parents
lost in hospital under unclear conditions, in the denial of the 1990s, when it had only two months of life, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in italy, in the same years that adoption was aguely regulated, a young woman, now a blber and beautiful girl, met the day yesterday in iasi with biological parents in a other village.
crina will last 20 years these days and her adoptive parents in palermo thought to give their loving daughter a stunning and courageous gift: a visit to romania, to iasi, in order to know their past unclear.
the " de iasi newspaper, " which witnessed search for the home family after several highly vague indications, witnessed these meetings that basically rurupt your heart.
according to reporters, emotions at times, statements by those involved, their reactions are downright moving and overwhelming.
crin's story starts 20 years ago in rusty locality, while it was only two months.
then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to hospital.
disagreements began at home between parents and the mother had to go on the home.
he decided to keep up and to send me from home.
he has stopped the girl, and since then we have not known anything before.
" when i found out he was in hospital, it was too late, " indurerata alina, a biological mother of the girl, remembers.
crina was admitted with her grandmother at pascani city hospital, and then the father of the girl, costica balcan, left for work in the town of alexandria, teleorman county.
their lives were permanently separated.
no longer find crin at hospital
after internalisation, the crin's father left for work in another village, and returned six months later.
meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the iasi hospital and the father, when he returned, found her again.
i think it had been almost nine months since the girl was in hospital.
" she thought she was abandoned, " she tells an grandchild of the family.
due to financial problems, grandmother was unable to come with crin to iasi, and the girl remained in doctors' care.
because no one was interested in the fate of the child all the time, she was taken over by the directorate-general for social assistance and protection of the iasi child, who then looked to care for the foster centre in bucium.
there were years in which abandonment and adoption were more lax than today in romania.
at the bucium centre was found by italy's salvadore and his wife, a couple from palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
they fell in love with blonduta crina, and some time she had to move permanently with them to italy.
it had already done nearly two years since adoption formalities lasted.
when we saw the crin, we felt it was before us.
" as if my wife gave him his life, " tells us smiling salvadore, the adoptive father, while taking in the palface of the girl.
in the country, crin's parents, alina and costica, continued their searches separately, each where she could.
the father asked the rusty authorities, but received no answer where his child could be.
police then told them that they may be dead, but in iasi parents found out what really happened in front of them.
when i looked for her here, they told me in court that she was going for italy in palermo.
and i will look for it no longer had it.
we asked god to be good.
i thought about it in all the years to come, but there were not possibilities, to find it.
" it's hard, " tearfully tells us with the crin's biological mother in our eyes.
but even if the years passed, rusty parents were not forgotten.
in italy, salvadore and the wife explained to the girl where it comes from and that her past connects it with romania.
i was small to learn.
i think i was five or six years old.
i reacted as a copy, i was curious.
" i wanted to know my parents in romania, " i confess crina.
and her dream was to become reality.
in march of this year, chief commissioner romica ichim, director of the regional centre for prevention, evaluation and anti-drug counselling, was contacted by an knowledge from italy, who explained salvadore's desire to find the drc's biological family.
and the search started only from a name.
after our request from our italian partners, we started the first.
we had only received a name, balcan costica, then locality, rusty.
shortly i had a job with city hall there, and i could ask whether there is the name received by quality.
then they gave me some indications, only that the person found was not the one wanted.
" it took about a month to go for us to find the biological father of the girl, " chief commissioner romica ichim explains us.
in all, more than three months have taken authorities to find costica alina alina, especially as everyone resident in another village.
we began work somewhere in march, and in june-july we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
" then we established that a first meeting would take place in september, " romica ichim added.
at the weekend, alina and costica first saw their first girl lost at the hospital offices in iasi, 20 years ago.
the father, moved, was barely able to control his tears, and his hands passed him relrelessly.
it is just changing a few words to those around.
a week before the meeting could not even sleep.
it was increasingly emotional, passing.
" to see your child after so many years, it's something, " tells us an grandchild, coming from rugy as well.
meeting with mother, biological brother
in talks with him, who is expected to study at a well-rated university in italy, costica balcan told him, among other things, that if he once wants to return to him, to the village, to come peacefully: he can give him some sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and nurer a household.
my mother is also emotional, complains, and she hardly believes that this can happen to them.
i am.
i did not believe that this could happen.
i saw such cases on television, i thought for mind these years, i hoped, but i did not think that could be the case.
great emotions.
if it could forgive me.
i hope that we will visit each other in the future.
" i hope that we can keep a touch, " says great tears to obraji alina, crin's mother, while holding a servetde in her hands.
he is, he conceals his tears, happiness, because he will soon see himself with them after so long weather.
on the other hand, crina, which will last in just a few days' time this month, is trying to reassure itself like an emotional child.
he does not know what to expect, but has sketched a vague idea of his biological parents.
he think there are young people, but now before the meeting they try to remember, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
my parents are two mothers and fathers.
but it is my parents at the end of the day who have increased me.
it will be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
" i hope to have a nice memory with them, because now there is so much to say, " i confess.
first family meeting
in the union market, under the sky of the beginning of the autumn, the rusty family once again unites their destiny in front of them in palermo.
crina is 20 years old finishing high school along the italian school model, but can begin a new chapter with alina and costica, her biological parents.
there are no more borders or countries dividing them, but only one barrier: that of language.
over which, with the help of an translator, an italian local owner at the centre of hell, easily passed.
those who managed to make this meeting possible say it is the first event of its kind to do, and that in future, if the opportunity arises, they will do so.
it is the first event of its kind to be organised by such an emotional charge, and i am pleased to be a success.
we at the centre have different activities, and we are often associated as an institution that deals only with consumer people, drug-related addicts.
but we are trying to get something good to society back.
" if i have asked for such a food of food, i will do so with great dear, " says by smiling romica ichim, director of the regional centre for iasi prevention, evaluation and anti-counselling.
behind him, the balcan family, crin in the middle, tells itself.
i am understandable: they have a great deal to say to each other.
a arms truce yesterday in the psd.
everyone shos
camps in the emerging psd branch ended a ceasefire on the leg.
after successive rounds of talks from friday to sunday, the first and most tense, psd leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
pressed by party executive president liviu dragnea to present a united position, the emerging social democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for party posts.
far from over, the internal war in the party seems to have taken only a break to allow combatants to shoot their soul.
dragnea gave no ultimatum.
it has sent a very simple and very current message under the current conditions: you are trying to find a solution not to jeopardise the party.
on october 3rd we have party elections.
all functions will be made available to those who want them.
" until then, we remain in the existing structure, " said acting mayor mihai cyrillic.
the two days of talks at the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing doubt was established.
fierce competition is expected to serve in the october elections as president of the psd's county branch.
on the brief list of possible candidates for the top post in the party's emerging branch are state secretary maricel popa, senator florin constantinescu, senator sorin lazar, county adviser vasile catea and the acting president of the county council, victorel lupu.
added to that were mayor of como schitu duca, mihai mihalache.
one option under consideration is also psd county advisers leader cristian stanciu's candidacy should lupu no longer join the race, with party sources saying he is not interested in the post.
the only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of former branch mayor gheorghe nichita.
the candidate list is open.
applications can be submitted under status, including on election day, and would not bride anyone if they happened.
" what is important is that we remain united, and we will stay after october 3rd, when we have a new executive office, a new permanent county office and all new management structures, " catea added.
until internal elections are held, the leadership of the psd county branch will be secured by victorel lupu, a close nichita and stanciu.
lupu, however, is on leave until 29 september, with the preparation of the elections practically to be secured by the branch executive adviser mihail popescu, who reccold relations with the nichita camp.
contacted by phone cristian stanciu praised the talks in recent days as leading to " a partial consensus. "
there is willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
a partial consensus was reached to support a unitary team to deal with the county.
" but on the other hand, there are several variants regarding intentions related to candidacy for membership in the psd presidency, with the list remaining open, " stanciu commented.
emerging judge refused the file of vaslui rapists on the grounds of competition
seven young people in vaslui county convicted of rape today reach the iasi appeals court.
vasluians sentenced to sentences of five years to eight months and eight years and four months will today present their arguments on their imprisonment, after the substantive court, judge vaslui, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentencing.
the file was registered at the appeals court late last week, with magiate dan anton formulating a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
anton cited that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer bogdan luca, is the competition of his daughter, lawyer dana anton.
luca defends silviu ovidiu burada, who received the highest sentence on the dossier.
how motivated judges
late last week, the magistrate at judge vaslui, who sentenced the seven young people, motivated the sentence.
in motivating the judge talks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, pointing out that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
" the court notes that after the time judicial control was placed under preventive measures, the restrictive measure of freedom but not freedom, under the impact of the attitude of defendants, their families and local supporters, felt a strong sense of indignation within the local and national community that people accused of serious facts are being tried to less restrictive extent, " vaslui judgment said.
magistrates also dismantled the main defence of the seven defendants who during the trial cited that the girl they raped would not be the the door of church. "
" the court states that it lacks irrelevant the moral quality of the injured person, which the defendants wanted to highlight with the machinery they formulated, as a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated on any pretext, " the motivation also states.
corbyn, brexit, european future
for economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades cannot continue the same in the coming years.
until saturday little people knew in romania who jeremy corbyn was.
even today, after he became the new leader of the uk labour party, many are wondering to what extent the election of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
jeremy corbyn is the most radical left-wing leader of post-war labour workers.
marxist said, anti-monarchist (he once asked tony blair, then prime minister, to pull the royal family out of buckingam palace), a fervent anti-american and an sympathiser of vladimir putin (was otherwise regularly invited to comment on political developments by the television channel " russia today "), and hizbollah and hamas, wants to leave britain.
for corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of osama bin laden a real tragedy, isis is almost preferable to the united states.
based on the model of all populist demagogues, corbyn, of course, has miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
things of the kind he said and promised and tsipras in greece until they chest with the real world and economic ties.
the economic programme of the new labour leader provides, among other things, for massive renationalisation and the printing of money as a solution to finance projects to develop and cover very generous social benefits.
of course, some might wonder why the solution for printing money is not unanimously adopted around the globe, we would then have global general prosperity! but who would prevent themselves from such details.
of course, we can charge blood on bankers, become a kind of service enemies of the left, but as it has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or ecuador or venezuela, but also in france at the beginning of mitterand hollande's mandates.
the additional sums are quickly swallowed by generous, cover promises by populist demagogues.
as margaret thatcher rightly pointed out, " the problem of socialism is that at one point others' money ends. "
few give jeremy corbyn a real chance of ever reaching prime minister.
in the early 1980s, another radical left-wing leader, michael foot, who was not as convinced anyway as the fresh party leader, failed lamentably in the elections.
and then there is still a workers' class in britain in the relatively consistent and structured sense of the word.
and trade unions were sensitive more influential than now.
against the background of the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant throughout the labour force, and extensive automatiations have made a massive need for highly qualified labour in industry, corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
however, even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
in his latest financial times, he believes corbyn's election increases the chances of brexit, namely britain's exit from the eu.
the new labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's union membership.
in the eyes of the radical left, brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that imposed austerity on the poor.
when you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis rocking the foundations of the eu, reaching an explosive mix.
not just britain.
but if the british decide following the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the union the loss of symbolic capital for the entire european project and the deep lines created within it by the euro crisis, and now that is why refugees, between north and south, between east and west, leave room for scenarios of the most worrying.
all the more so because for a whole series of member states, london was an counterbalance to the franco-german axis (in which berlin anyway is increasingly becoming the dominant actor).
admittedly, the british business environment, the city, are strong lawyers of the country's stay in the eu.
but today's europe is no longer that of the past.
there are many resentment, which are growing in intensity in these very few weeks.
the problem is that brussels, i had a sample just recently in jean clude junker's speech, increasingly tends to take major decisions over the head of the vast majority of member states consulting with only a few european powers, mainly with germany.
and this is at a time when electoral support for the anti, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time and eurosceptic is growing dramatically throughout the continent.
in other words, the tionally charged climate has reached higher than ever in the past.
hence, the conclusion that the financial times draws from when assessing brexit's chances.
the pro-eu option is based on a cold calculation leaving national interest.
if voters make cerebral decision, then britain will remain in the eu.
but corbyn's victory reminds us of the strength of excitement in current politics.
however, eastern europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
especially if, as expected, we see greater integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and on the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in europe.
corbyn, tsipras and syriza in greece, podemos in spain, even bernie sanders in the united states are feeding their populist rhetoric accumulated in osociental societies.
for economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades, generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the coming years.
under explosive pressure from the dual crisis, the euro area - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that have only taken account of integrationist political ambitions, not the capacity and availability of the peoples and governments of europe to respond to such challenges, turbulence on the continent, internal tensions in the eu will increase in intensity and may seriously affect romania's situation.
and it is hard to exclude something in terms of possible scenarios.
the question is whether our main political leaders are in a position to cope with such complicated situations.
constantin brancusi, taran.
rockefeller:' how can i help?'
brancusi: " also mature the workshop! "
the great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to get famous, to hear about it all over the world.
behind his well-known, however, something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for life success.
that also has a name.
it is to be called' truda'.
what write about constantin brancusi?
what remains to say, in fact?
his figure appeared on banknotes.
and recently, a well-known bank of romania hired an actor to play him in a advertising clip.
brancusi produces and supplies money nearly 60 years after it is no longer among us.
in romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards bearing his name.
in fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
and when they leaves out with odrasla, you hear the following instructions:' we are going to the park, brancusi'.
the country is crowded with its statue.
there are few romanian figures whose works are known to so much, from children to the elderly.
brancusi's infiltration capacity is huge.
the communists also failed to extirpe out of romania's memory and culture.
his quotations place the internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of like ings and share.
and, then, once again, what would still be to say, to write about this man?
viewed from a lot of books and articles trying to reconstitute his destiny, brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, which is totally unlikely.
you know, there are those people who tell you that if you did not have the good fortune to born in any large city and in a family as well as possible, your chances of success in life are almost null.
brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
and perhaps a key here.
perhaps the text to come should start from this point.
with one sentence, however they are.
look at the success stories crete, which are delivered to you daily in the newspapers and on television.
take a close look at the figure of this man.
do you want to know how he has succeeded in life, how today, he has heard a whole pamworld?
it is simple.
he has worked to be someone.
that is what it has done.
constantin brancusi is born on february 19th 1876 in hobita, a small village shared to fish, gorj county at carpathpathians.
he is the fifth child and radu nicolae brancusi.
although he came from a wealthy family, brancusi leads a modest life, but one of which he would reap the benchmarks that will guide his late artistic vision.
recalling his childhood and places where he grew, the artist had to confess, at a meeting with petre tutea in paris in 1933: " then life was beautiful and harmonious. "
people have been happily taking a patriarchal life for millennia.
everything quiet from one seasons to another.
and do you know why things have changed?
the civilisation of the great city has reached us.
brancusi's childhood, however, was far from idyllic.
one of the moments in these first years of life is highly revealing of the combination of purity and violence that characterised the future sculptor years spent in their home town.
the moment is being re-produced in the work " cheese; a biography, " written by alexandru buican.
in 1879, constantin brancusi was 3.
in the autumn of that year, when tuica was done " overnight barracks, " watching those who sample the liquid to see if the process is going properly, cheese and catches a moment of general attention.
it fills its palats with tuica and drink on brepressed.
it falls into almost instantaneously.
the first people see only a few minutes later.
the mother panic, then in hysteria, believing her son died.
later, when the father, radu radu, returns from alive accompanied by greists, he sees away the desperate signs of those who very much await him at his mouth.
the party immediately turns into jale.
the father is already considering burying.
however, someone finds it is good to call on baba brandusa, doe and servvers of cheese.
cheese verifies children's breath, then puts them under the balega of horse gathered from preajma.
the child hard.
the world applauds.
while the boy is left to sleep his anger further, joy, spending with grerels continues with even more force.
the next day, father and son meet through livada.
radu brancusi puts constantin to collect nuts and bring them.
the father puts his child with his head down and, with the expenses made by the boy, beats him to remember him.
and while feeling the ustasty of the blows, small cheese has revelation that the world can also be viewed from another perspective and that the surrounding things can be overturned.
especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him ask himself, as he had to recognise in old age, if not the very himself participates in his turmoil.
had the sun been as disturbed as his father or what happened to him?
currently, city works
an mp calls on politicians to remember those who voted.
independent deputy viorel blajut called on the psd and the pnl to stop their internal battles and reorient their agenda to the electorate.
what we are now seeing on our political scene is a great divide.
we have seen nothing of the usl projects in 2012 that will continue.
neither the highway nor the regional emergency hospital can see how politicians dispute possible sites according to real estate interests.
let us leave politics aside, gather and speak.
at the moment, the city is not working.
" if you are busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who elected you, " blajut said.
he assessed that the current political class disappointed emerging voters, as a result of being a very low turnout in the upcoming local elections around the 30% figure, effectively representing the parties' core electorate.
the deputy also believes that voters will also move towards traditional parties, expressing reservations over new political initiatives, such as the " for iasi " party, which will be launched today.
local parties have a very little chance and will only break the electorate of the right, not that of the psd.
such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually right.
" it's further shmering the right, which is not good for anyone, nor for the psd, " blajut said.
he made it clear that he is not interested in candidacy in the upcoming local elections, denying rumours of his intention to join the mayoral race.
i have also said that i do not want to run for any local position.
i am also considering whether to continue as a member in the next term of office as well.
i tried to call for unity for iasi and in cholholding discussions, with the other parliamentarians, and i was accused of wanting to give my image.
i do not want, but we cannot go on like that.
" if people voted for us, it does not mean they are fools to vote for us if they see nothing more, " said blajut, who assessed that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of another.
a colleague from tatarasi said he did not get his money and must go by bus.
let us not be hypocritical.
there is little money.
sometimes i am ashamed to raise the money from the cake.
at the end of my mandate, i will make a report with everything i have spent, apart from the salaries of cabinet employees and its maintenance.
i have happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all transport deaccounts, accommodation and the others.
" telling an mp he does not get his money is clean hypocrisy, " blut ended.
