un chief says no military solutions in syria
secretary-general ban ki-moon says his response to russia's military support for syria is that " there is no military solution " to the nearly-year year conflict, and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
the un chief again urged all parties, including the divided un security council to unitogether and support negotiations in order to find a political solution.
ban said at a conference wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent countries currently the council in the council-the us, russia, china, england and france -- on the ministerial session of the general assembly to discuss syria.
ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the syrian people and regional powers " have made this situation unresolved. "
ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the syrian crisis.
8 polls showing donald trump has real chances
some tried to label it as a " lip-flop " politician.
others called him a joke.
and others wait awaiting implosion.
but regardless of how some republicans are trying to remove donald trump from the top of the polls, it has not worked (yet).
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that donald trump is ves with two figures, and some are starting to ask itself seriously what this means for the chances of appointing the real estate mogul.
of course, it is still premature.
none of this says trump will win the race for nominating the republicans.
pundits shows that during the same period in 2011, rick perry's lead led to herman cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
and the reasons why it would fight hard in the general elections are many.
but outside groups such as jeb bush's super cap and the economically conservative conservative group club for growth recognise trump's power and are beginning to support it with money.
we are still presenting to you some figures in recent polls suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just a passing thing:
the figures indicating support for trump returned to 180 degrees.
even before donald trump announced his candidacy in mid-june, a poll by the university of monmouth said only two out of 10 republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
by mid-july, the percentage climbed to 40%.
in early august, it was 52%.
currently, six out of 10 republicans have a favourable view of donald trump.
about three out of 10 say they have a negative view.
these figures remain.
a poll last week by quinnipiac in iowa concluded that 60% of the region's republicans have a favourable view of the trump.
two-thirds of gop voters would be happy if trumtrump won race nomination race.
in a poll last week by cnn / orc, 67% of the republicans said they would be " excited " or " satisfied " if the trump won the nomination race.
only two out of 10 say they would be " upset " if trump won the race for the nomination.
only ben carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as trump (43% says he would be " enthusiastic " about 40% who say the same about trump).
closest in terms of enthusiasm?
marco rubio, with only 21%.
on the other hand, 47% of republican voters say they would be " dissatisfied " or " upset " if the favourite jeb bush wins the nomination race.
most republicans do not see trump's temperament problem.
although donald trump has been strongly criticised for insults to his bombastic style, 52% of domestic republican voters believe real estate mogul has the right temperament for president, according to a poll conducted by abc news / washington post on monday.
we find the same figures in the state of iowa, where also 52% of republicans believe the trump has the right personality to be leader, according to a poll by quinnipiac last week.
however, 44% believe it does not have the personality to act effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperature has no place at the white house, according to abc / post.
republican voters get used to the idea.
when taking the attitude of intellectuals, republican voters consider the trump authentic.
according to a poll last week by cnn / orc, on the question of who has the best chance of winning the race for nominating gop, four out of 10 said trump.
the situation has changed since the end of july, when four out of 10 gambled jeb bush.
full information: in the past, gop voters have not read the future very well.
during the same period of the last elections, four out of 10 republicans chose rick perry in the race, compared from only 28% for mitt romney.
but these figures show that the majority of gop voters consider trump's campaign plausible.
even though the republicans or handodreadful to another candidate; trump still tops everyone.
some say the divided situation is likely contribute to trump's victory, while support for trump will split to more than a dozen candidates.
but a early september poll by the university of monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of collaboration between the trump and most other republican candidates, almost always trump will benefit from majority support.
trump is 13 points away from carly fiorina on 14 points of marco rubio, 15 points by walker, on 19 points of jeb bush and 33 points each from around paul, john kasich and chris christie.
it is almost to par with ted cruz.
the only candidate who beat it?
ben carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical-one-one confrontation.
most of donald trump's supporters say they decided.
a new poll tuesday by cbs / nyt shows that more than half of voters who back trump say they are not changing their voting option.
obviously, much can happen about this and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave loophole open to the possibility of changing their option.
however, trump's most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon ben carson, but it is twice as likely that voters who say they decided to vote with trump.
six out of 10 republicans say i agree with trump on immigration.
since donald trump appointed immigrants from mexico " rapists " in his opening speech at his campaign two months ago, immigration has been the central topic in the campaign for 2016.
some worry that trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between important hispanic voters and the republican party and will harm efforts to rebranding.
but according to a poll conducted by abc / post on monday, six of 10 republicans say they agree agree with trump on immigration.
so it seems that as long as the immigration problem remains in the spotlight, so will remain be doland trump.
frustration with the authorities reaches new colours.
donald trump and ben carson are now supported by nearly half of republican voters, largely because of their status as outsent.
according to a poll conducted by abc / post on monday, six out of 10 republicsay they prefer prefer a political sider to the expense of someone experienced experienced.
people are also angry with washington.
a poll two weeks ago in iowa by des moines register / bloomberg shows that three out of four iowa republicans are frustrated with the performance of the republics in the congress, with 54% saying they were " dissatisfied " and 21% " nervous in cules. "
jeremy corbyn makes debut at prime ministry's questions
since his election, mr corbyn's debut in pmqs has long long awaited
the new leader of the labour party, jeremy corbyn, will make his debut at prime ministry's questions, facing david cameron for the first time.
mr corbyn will ask the first of the six questions he entitled shortly after lunch; his performance is likely to be closely examined by the media and labour parliamentarians.
as part of weekly appearances, he called for " less theatre and more deeds. "
he also said he can give up some participation and give in to his colleagues.
the confrontation will be the first parliamentary test of mr corbyn as a leader, coming after appointing a' ghost cabinet' and his speech at the annual tuc congress on tuesday.
meanwhile, the decision of the labour party's labour party to remain silent about the news of the national anthem part of a job held tuesday on 75th 5th anniversary of the battle of england drew criticism from conservative lawmakers and made the headlines.
corbyn's decision not to sing national anthem points out
a spokesman for mr corbyn said that he' kept silent respectfully' and recognised the' heroism of british air forces in the battle of england'.
but a member of the phantom cabinet of mr corbyn, owen smith, told the two's newsnight programme broadcast by the bbc that he had recommended that the labour leader to sing the national anthem " regardless' of his belief that monarchy should be abolished.
around a dozen fanantom cabinet ministers refused to be part of mr corbyn's leading team, arguing by differences of opinion on the economy, defence and foreign, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
bbc political correspondent robin brant says differences in politics " come together " in the labour party after mr corbyn's appointed regarding his position towards the eu and the benefits limit.
mr corbyn said at the tuc conference that the labour party would bring about changes to completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
a few hours later, mr smith, the minister for labour and pensions, stated that the party' is very clear' in exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce' head' level from 26,000 lira to 23.000 lira.
mr corbyn will be the fifth labour leader facing david cameron in the gallery in the last decade since he assumed the helm of the conservative party.
the labour leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, says that he has ideas' from external sources ideas for questions to ask mr cameron and and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
parliament member islington north said pmqs involves ates too high a level of confrontation and would refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging instead focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
mr corbyn said that angela eagle, the finance minister, will hold his place in pmqs when he cannot participate - for example, when mr cameron moves abroad.
he also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying he has approached with chamber of deputies president john bercow to discuss this issue.
in 2005, when he took the lead, mr cameron said that he wanted to give up the political style punpunch and judy' often associated with pmqs, but acknowledged a few years later that he had failed to do so.
since the first transmission in 1990, pmqs has been considered a key barometer of the reasoning a leader leader the way in he drives the chamber of deputies and its position among fellow parliamentarians, although critics say it has become a caricature and that he needs profound reform.
" framework at job ": homeless young people receive photography courses
it is difficult to be a homeless man in johannesburg.
but a group of people who lived on the streets for childhood found a way of learning a profession and earn a living.

the bbc news met with one of the first graduates of the project.
jd sports says higher salaries could harm enlargement
jd sports president peter cowgill says an increase in the minimum wage in britain could mean " greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers. "
but the purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher costs for labour in the firm, he says.
costs could have an impact on jd sports's enlargement plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
thanasi kokkinakis backed by tennis australia president steve healy
thanasi kokkinakis would deserve praise and not criticism for his behaviour.
thanasi kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the " storm " around his friend nick kyrgios, and his behaviour rather deserves words of praise and criticism, in the opinion of tennis australia president steve healy.
kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called " special ks, " has been unpleasantly dragged into the spotlight by the scandalous derapment that kyrgios had to stan wawrinka at the montreal masters tournament.
in a hard qualification match played shortly after, in five years, the refereferee the seat had to intervene twice twice disdivide kokkinakis and his opponent rryan harrison, after which harrison said, " wawrinka should have put kyrgios and i should have put put the knees.
although seen last time making a powdered rocket after having cramon muscular and missed a possible us open tournament, angered richard gasquet, kokkinakis was strongly defended by healy.
the teener is currently in glasgow, where he battwith sam groth for second place individually, after bernard tomic in the davis cup semifinal against england.
" one thing i feel strong is that in my opinion, thanasi has been attracted a little into conflict, " healy said.
the truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he of crampe in us, but he is not the first player to break a frustration rocket with himself and i know thanasi well enough to know he would not be proud of it.
but let us be serious, it has meined extremely well in quite challenging situations in us with harrison and so on, and i think it deserves a great deal of trust.
it has an extraordinary team, it has a great family with us and i think it has been treated unfairly.
he is a very mature year-old man, he is working hard and integrated into the team, he has had no conflict with the other players, he is very respected in the west, he is very hard, he is in an excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young man, and i think he deserves be tried solely on the basis of his qualities and defects.
healy also backed the decision not to consider kyrkyrgifor for key milestone stake match, which begins friday, and described the " joint decision " as the most appropriate for all, but advocated the return of the original in the long-term canberra to the team.
" first, we want the team to focus fully on the rematch and not to think at all about the controversy surrounding [kyrgios], " healy said.
and i think nick moved very quickly, as people like federer and murray said, he is mataway under public public and made terrible mistakes, but we try try to,, help good both for the team and for him.
2016 2016: hillary clinton's advantage over bernie sanders shrank by half in national polls
former secretary of state hillary clinton still has a two-digadvantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but senator bernie sanders is gaining ground.
clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
vice president joe biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is backed by 15% of democratic voters.
at least five months before the start of the primary elections, the majority of democratic voters say it is too early to say they decided on the candidate they will support.
but clinton's supporters are stronger in choosing them than the supporters of other candidates.
compared to the poll conducted by cbs news last month, clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while sanders won several per cent.
clinton maintains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has narrowed.
support among men has narrowed considerably and sanders is only 5 points away.
clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now now being on a par with sanders.
clinton, however, is still popular among elderly voters.
last month, clinton was outside sanders, with two figures, among the liberals, but sanders now has a slight 5-point advantage in this group.
about half of democratic voters at the national level say they would enthusiastically support clinton if elected to run on behalf of the party.
a quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
six per cent would not support it.
perhaps unsurprising, the probability of clinton's current supporters being enthusiastic about her election is high.
opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support clinton -- only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
while 48% of democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support clinton, the number of republican voters who say the same about first donald trump (35%) is lower.
when clinton's supporters are asked an open question as to why would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has adequate experience (16%), followed followed by the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the post (10%).
clinton's supporters also mention her association with bill clinton (9%).
agreement on these aspects and eligibility is also mentioned.
with the vice president considering a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him in the race -- although one third believe he should not run.
asked about the second option for party representative, democratic voters are majority calling biden.
of clinton's supporters, more than half say biden would be the second option well ahead of sanders.
if biden decides not to run in the democratic party race, hillary clinton's advantage to sanders is growing from 20 points with biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of democratic voters consider clinton the candidate likely likely of winning the general elections; but the figures dropped from 78 per cent last month.
biden is second away, however, where he percentage most eligible has increased.
however, when asked what is most important for an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
as last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is seen by these voters as unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well on some key characteristics compared to their party's primary voters.
the majority of voters see clinton, sanders and biden as integrated and reliable and with solid leaders.
biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity, while clinton's strength is the leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not think h. clinton is integrated and reliable, twice as many as those who say so about sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion on it.
democratic voters also generally believe the three, clinton, sanders and biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
on all these issues, about a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion of sanders.
as questions persist regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by hillary clinton when she was state secretary, the majority of democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject and say she did not affect their general opinion on the candidate.
however, things are different among the us public.
half of the americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
public opinion was divided in march on the subject, shortly after the issue turned out.
most americans say the controversy over the email has not affected their general opinion on clinton, although 36 per cent say they have changed their opinion on negatively.
mainly republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their opinion on clinton in the negative sense.
although democratic voters consider clinton integrate and reliable, this issue continues to raise problems among voters generally: only 32% consider it integrate and reliable, 8% less than last month, and 15% less than in may.
62% of voters do not consider it integration and reliable.
at the same time, 55% of voters at national level do not consider trump integrated and trustworthy.
however, both clinton and trump have white bles for leadership.
of the six assessed candidates, biden, carson and bush rank the first in terms of integrity.
the number of those who consider integrative sanders is higher than those who disagree but, as in carson's case, many do not have an opinion of it.
the error margin for the sample 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
five brotherhood indicted for murder of student in 1 at baruch faculty
nearly two years after a faculty student lost his life during a initiation ritual in the pocono mountains in pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
members of the pi delta psi brotherhood of the baruch faculty in new york york brutally attacked chun " michael " deng during a ritual of initiated in september 2013 and postponed taking him to hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
official sources say the victim was tied to the eye, was put behind it a backpack pack of 14kg full of the sand and has been bullied bled repeatedly while trying to move towards a target on frozen land.
mr. deng accused headaches before then losing knowledge.
members of the pi delta psi brotherhood did not call the emergency number after he fainted and claim to have waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.
but they found the time needed to change deng's clothes, look for its symptoms of google and contact national brotherhood president andy meng to ask him for his advice, police chief chris wagner said at a press conference.
" at this moment, members have started hiding personal goods and put practically the good of the brotherhood before michael deng's good, " wagner said.
it could not be resurved and died the next day in the morning.
according to an autopsy report, deng suffered repeated traumas at its head, thraces and coapse.
" too many families have been devastated by the brothers' rituals since 1970 at least one student lost his life every year due to the rituals, " douglas fierberg, the lawyer for deng's family, said in a statement.
brothers and their members must be held accountable, and that move taken by the authorities is important.
the grand jury in monroe district recommended that the first five members be charged with three-degree crime.
thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including mr meng, will also be indicted for the ulj and complicity in the murder.
" we want to hold accountable not only the people involved but, if there is an organisation that authorised the brotherhood, officially or informally, we will also hold it accountable, " wagner said at a press conference tuesday.
the baruch faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with local representation.
that is what will happen when the federal reserve increases interest.
the interest rate will increase and bull market (growing market) will stumck, bond profitability will increase and the economy enters into recession.
that is what we know.
what we do not know is how long will happen and how long it will last.
in the economy, history offers few entry indications over time.
after the first increase would the interest rate, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
the aggressiveness of the federal reserve to raise interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets are respond.
that is why officials from the us central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start to raise interest rates but on the path of the time needed for normalisation.
indeed, there are many variables at stake.
but in the end, market players could see that all the turmoil over the increase in the interest rate has been exaggerated.
" the first increase in the interest rate decided by the edf after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the era " cheap money, " julian jessop, chief economist at capital economics, said in a note to customers.
on the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of interest rates in the us to more normal but small levels to be the seismic shock that all seem to be afraid.
but it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
we are to put forward how some sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
given the situation that the market has experienced in recent months, the anticipation of an interest rate rate can volatile up for some time.
but at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
" it seems there is a trend for the profitability of capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which perhaps again reflects deforestation in monetary policy, " deutsche bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after edf increases.
specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by around 14% - moving towards increasing interest rates, quite invariable over the 250-day period after (average of 2.6%) returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to recent analysis published on barron by chief nuveen asset management.
deutsche said the impact on actions tend to become pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits are beginning to fall.
the recession is a reality of economic life, but increasing the interest rate often contributes to it.
in the current situation, the edf faces conditions that did not exist before and which could speed up a recession.
specifically, gross domestic product will move closer to its historic minimum point for an increase in the edf interest rate.
according to deutsche bank, out of the 118 interest rate increases after 1950, only twice nominal gdp was less than 4.5%.
even though in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to atlanta edf.
increasing the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question of " whether this time it is different, " deutsche said.
market players have also prepared the year for a growth decision from the edf, with all eyes focused at this week's meeting of the federal open market commission, which ends on thursday.
although many strategists and economists believe the fomc could approve an increase in the interest rate at meeting meeting, term transactions indicate only 25% problikely.
" in our study after 1950, all cycles for increasing the interest rate to date have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with gdp eclipping the varieties before-recession very quickly after recovery began, " the report said.
on the contrary, this has been a strange recovery of sluggish after the worst recession in the period period.
the current cycle is by far the longest widely for by the edf since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months and it has reached 74 months and continues.
fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates and the printing tern is somewhat similar to dividends.
the main difference is that the impact is faster in case of bonds than in the case with actions when the edf changes policy.
in the case of bonds, the benefits to be changing changing direction once the first growth / decrease occurs in the cycle occurs.
at the end of the cycle of raising the interest rate, the profitability of bonds is falling immediately, " deutsche said.
the charles schwab strategies believe that these interest rate increases will bring bring profitability more together between short- and long-term bonds, cheising curve.
bonds with high profitability are doing better in such an environment, although " we are still wary of forcing profitability,, " kathy jones, a fixed income analyst with schwab, said in an analysis.
interestingly, jones is of the opinion that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of edf policy.
" besides the power of the dollar and the estimated inflation inflation, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy, " jones wrote.
interest rates in the short term have risen, curprofitability is fairer, the the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the edf tightens politics.
overall, majority-based companies in the us will benefit from an interest rate increase and local products will become more attractive.
the high-debt multinationals will suffer because increasing the dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market more expensive and their debt more expensive.
" history shows that " quality " stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months after an initial increase in the interest rate, " analyst goldman sachs said in a report to customers.
firms with strong balance shepassed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
companies with high capital proceeds and low-volatility stocks have also exceeded companies similar to lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
debt will become an important issue.
companies with a large percentage of fleet debt have the most to lose, goldman says.
consumers will also benefit from the rise of the dollar.
those who save could also benefit, although experts disagree disagree on how quickly this will happen.
bbc radio 3 a copy after fm classics, says mp andrew bingham
conservative mp andrew bingham criticises radio for " fool "
he says he increasingly similar to trade opponent
it also eyes bbc music awards, saying they plaged brits awards
colleague damien collins attacked the voice, calling the issue original either
bbc radio 3 " turns into " classics fm, a senior mp said, putting pressure pressure to prove it is doing something that commercial stations are not doing.
conservative mp andrew bingham also told bbc heads that public radio as " foolish " and increasingly resembles the trade opponent.
" i have the impression that radio 3 " fose " -- although i don't like using the word -- but i have the impression that it is turning into fm classic, " he said.
it also took the bbc music awards, launched was december last year.
bbc music awards, launched last year, appears to be brarm under another name.
so if you try to do something different -- these are the two examples that come to mind that only copicopy what already exists on the market, " mr bingham said.
the bbc director-general denied the accusations, saying bbc radio 3 is well in front of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and public education.
i will not find out anywhere about classical music coming from radio 3.
and his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
" moreover, i think radio 3's commitment to unnew new music and allocation of new parts, " he said, is also important.
in the first part of this year, bbc radio 3 editor alan davey said he needs to do more to attract an audience from the previous period because the british have less knowledge of classical music.
but radio 3 was not the only element under the bbc logo criticised at a meeting of the culture, media and sports committee for going along the footsteps of its trade rivals.
conservative mp damien collins attacked the voice -- the taltalent show bought by the bbc from dutch producer talpa media for around gbp 22 million.
you understand why there are often discussions on that issue because it is not original and distinguishes itself by nothing?
lord hall insisted that the bbc1 show -- having the paloma faith and boy george in jurjury -- be conducted " in a manner specific to the bbc. "
he added that he wants the corporation " to find the egg chicken in its own ography " next time it launches a entertainment show.
however, he refused to ban in future the taking of new seasons in the voice or spend money leading on licenses on other entertainment facilities.
internet sales drop lowest in august, guilty responsible could be black friday
in the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
over the last month, there has been the slower growth since 2000.
online sales gained momentum three years ago, due to the use of a mobile phone to shop.
specialists say the black friday of november could lead to a reluctance to spend.
for more than a decade, online shopping have explooff and have turned commercial streets of britain into ghost cities.
specialists, however, say there are signs that online sales are diminking, with the latest figures indicating a only 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
the total money spent in august presented the lowest growth since 2000, with an increase of only 5% over the past year.
specialists say there are signs that online sales are diminking, with the latest figures indicating a only 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
" if we look at the level of growth in previous years and return to 2000, there has always been a tendency rationalising over time, " andy mulcahy, editor of the imrg sales index, told guardian.
he explained that online sales gained momentum three years ago, when buyers started using their mobile phone to make purchases.
thus, the number of people who could make online purchases has increased and do so under different circumstances, such as the seers.
but now that it is stagnating a little, you could see a decrease (in growth).
the black friday phenomenon, imported from america is cited as one of the reasons for falling sales.
in the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases ahead of the event over the past friday in november.
last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked in front of computers to put hands on offers, which led to the collapse of sites of several retailers.
specialists say black friday, when buyers beat on bargains, could lead to the reluctance of buyers.
a study published by british retail consortium determined that at least 1 titles from every 5 fortress is spent online.
in the case of certain products, such as televisets and washing cars, more than a third of the purchases are currently carried out via online shops.
at the same time, more than a quarter prefer prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to fashion shops in commercial areas.

today, king salman said the binladin group should not have left the arm of butcranes raised when the bloodshed was not in operation.
an arab version of the decree, published by the saudi news agency, said the binladin group bears partly the blame for collapse.
the news agency's english service did not present the detail, but said company leaders had been banned banned from leaving the country.
earlier this week, salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the macary in the court of the great mosque, where hundreds of thousands of muslims came ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
the binladin group has not yet made statements about the collapse of butchanes and group representatives could not be contacted for statements.
the royal decree blamed the group for failing to use up-to-date safety safety measures and not co-ordinate its work with weather authorities.
dozens of bloodshed around the great mosque in mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the binladin group.
for several now, the binladin family has had a close relationship with saudi arabia's royal family and has been conducting major construction projects.
the last qaida leader osama bin laden, was a a " reneged, " inherited by the family in the 1990s.
the collapse occurred in strong wind conditions and rain, just days before the arrival of millions of people on the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the life of every muslim who physically pressed.
authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
authorities have decided that relatives of the deceased victims receive one million million saudi (gbp 174.000) and the same amount should pay to those with permanent injuries.
other injured will receive half that that.
advantages, disadvantages of credit converin swiss francs
two offers for conversion into credit ei in swiss francs have already appeared on the banking market, the main benefits being to exclude foreign currency risk and lower rates.
the disadvantages may come in a few years' time, when variable able interest can to higher the rates.
transylvania bank has just completed the process of credit conversion into francs by volksbank, and the post bank announced its conversion offer for its own clients.
according to cumulative data by analysts from the financial portal finzoom, post post offer three years of fixed interest on lei of 1.5%, the lowest in the market.
on the other hand, the transylvania bank converoffer of the transylvania bank was accepted by 83% of customers with credit in francs due to two successive cuts: the balance has been reduced to the value of the risk and administration fees paid by the customer, then an additional 22.5% reduction in soil in lei was applied.
both offers lower the rates of their own customers, compared to how they paid equivalent monthly in lei before the conversion.
thus, the transylvania bank is reducing the rate by 42.5%, and post bank, by 33% in the first three years and theoretically by 18% in the coming years.
benefits
the main advantage of the weather in credit lei in chf is that the currency risk is eliminated, with the consumer protected by future increases in frankes, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency where he receives his salary.
another major advantage in both offers of conversion is that no property-reassessment is being carried out, no additional guarantees and proof proof revenue are being requested.
in practical terms, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of credit, nor will there be any additional costs as in the case of recovery.
both banks also offer a reduction at the monthly rate, compared to how much customers paid before conversion, which equivalent in lei.
risks
the problem is that the first years rate consists of more of interest and the customer customer repaying very little mainly.
the offer of the very low-interest bank in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
it is unclear, however, how this interest will evolve after three years.
the margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25 per cent, so in total, and cost reduction is lower.
a possible risk to all credits in the variable interest ei is for the robor index to increase significantly in the coming years (more than the libor-chf) index.
for example robor every three months now is 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached reached 6% in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days after 2008, it exceeded 40%!
in addition, other costs may also arise, not mentioned mentioned in their initial offer.
time is time for decisions on interest rate for us federal reserve
the world is watching its eyes at a meeting scheduled in two days, wednesday and thursday, when the us federal reserve will make a crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
in a reuters poll with the participation of 80 economists, just over half who last week thought the decision would be made, i now believe the situation will remain for and and interest interest rates would be kept the the current 0-0.25%.
this is an historic event because seven years have passed since the federal reserve brought the rates to zero.
for the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a process of interest rate normalisation, " said angel ubide, chief analyst with the peterson institute for international economics.
the us economy has evolved relatively well, with recovery bringing usd trillion to the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
but the federal reserve must not ignore the global situation less rosy.
he has warned the markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
the decision will be announced on tuesday, 20: 00 tec.
stars who lost their charming
actor (left), along with his son redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
in 2001, he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his life partner, farrah fawcett, to cancer.
the actor is also rumoured to have faced the problem of drug consumption and and in 2008 was arrested for drug possession.
all this certainly has a cost.
player luke shaw of manchester united stands on the bar for months due to double fractuets.
luke shaw suffered a double fracture on his right leg in manchester united's champions league league match with a defeat over psv eindhoven.
after the event, brought tears to the player's eyes and which will keep the bbar for at least six months, louis van gaal remains optimistic that shaw will be able to play again this season.
the injury came following reckless intervention by hécctor moo o in the 15th minute after shaw, 20, broke defence of psv defence.
he received medical care for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before taking to hospital.
van gaal said " has a double fracture on his leg and is in hospital. "
it will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps the day after tomorrow will then be operated in manchester.
it is appalling - a boy who came to manchester united when he was 18, is difficulties, then plays plays fantastic and now this is happening.
in the west, he was a mask of oxygen.
the complaint.
i am not a doctor, but at the double fracture, it is six months and will not play in the group phase.
i hope that it can once again play this season.
it seems that moreno has had luck and has escaped his red card and concesigning a coup of punishment.
referee nicola rizzoli has not punish mexican mexican.
van gaal suggested the italian official was wrong.
you can judge alone when i say that it is a red card and card.
it was a very ugly intervention with two legs.
a message on shaw's twitter account:' thank you all for your messages, i do not have words to express how weakened i feel, the road to recovery recovery is beginning, i will come back more strongly'.

phillip cocu, coach psv, said " it is a very ugly injury. "
everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
our players never seek to injured an adversary.
moreno broke his leg playing mexico's national team against the national of the netherlands led by van gaal at the 2014 world championship.
" it is very difficult for her because he did not intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it is a very serious injury, it is not good, " cocu said.
i have not seen the phase.
i only managed to see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed [moreno] achieved it but i could not see intervention against luke.

adam lyth clearly riskengland's omission, but still alive
the victory over pakistan in the united arab emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing england's team for the tournament, i am considering a repeat of a 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
i would not eliminate a victory in travel either.
alastair cook's team may have less experience than three years ago, but it has good players at hope in the firing ting line and collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by events in 2012 but will have a positive attitude of youth.
moeen ali evolves as spinner and adil rashid, even if unknown at the test level, is an option for the attack.
similar topics: adam lyth left england team for test matches and replaced by alex hales
obviously, as his chief coach in yorkshire, i find it difficult to look at the decision not to select adam lyth on the team.
he played seven test matches against two good strikers in difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are on trial after the results.
there were no question marks about joe root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and i said this before - the players are their own selection.
for fifty years and may lyth would have extended its run, but its destiny is in its hands.
i hope that if it does more run for yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
the head coach of the team of england, trevor bayliss, praised his attitude even when his performance was not in line with his capacity and it does not surprise me that; above all, he is a team man.
it is hard to answer the question while a batsman is noted in the test matches.
lyth had seven run runs -- as did sam robson before him -- while nick compton had nine.
only compton had good luck at home and travelling.
the only dissatisfaction you can have was that england preferred jonathan trott on the caribbean tour - when lyth was in the maximum form - but that missed opportunity is in a thing of the past.
the team comes alex hales, a batsman whom i-chair very well.
he is a cricket player who has the " factor x " and i noticed early in yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a pitch trent bridge.
it should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will course depend on the composition of the uae team.
the idea of moeen has been launched opening to beating with cook, which would lead extra spinner while preserving four quicks, and i have nothing against it.
i do not see why a carter could not hit there and this clumsy player has already shown that he is naive.
moeen may not bring success in his district, worcestershire, but it was no 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
my old team colleague, justin langer, played his first 38 38 test matches as first drop before entering the open in 2001.
it deleted three centuries immediately and did not look behind.
zafar ansari comes to the team as back-up spinner and, although i had limited contact with him, it struck me to being a very impressive young man.
people could judge early age -- with an average of 31 on the beating and 35 in the ball -- and they might think it is pun, but there is no lot of nibacks and selection opted for youth.
he will learn much of the tournament.
england has also made some changes to the coaching team.
the appointment of mahela jayawardene, sri lanka's batsman, as consultant for test matches could be a master blow.
he is one of the best players and he will bring a great deal of experience, given that he has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
paul collingwood comes to white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and ruless ambition.
i have always believed he was born to get involved in the international cricket, whether as a player or coach, and like mahela, he has a intition.
sometimes, new voices in the west, even if they send messages that were sent before, can bring fresh air to the team.
colly durham's teammate ben stokes, restfor the one-day matches, root received a similar break against australia, and i have no problem with that.
although not all agree, coaches and selection are not doing the programme.
and you have to note, players' jobs depend on the results they achieve.
such decisions are never taken easily.
brexit camp could win if the economy remains in its slel by 2017
every day, the strategy for renegotiate david cameron in order to keep britain into the eu is coming increasingly and into the mess, even without the election of geniant jeremy' yes or not?' corbyn at the helm of the labour party, or tuc bring serious criticism of europe on tuesday.
foreigners also have personers such as corbyn and nigel farages.
a european diplomat explained in recent days that - sunmerged in crises similar to that in the eu - not all being caused internally - some member states are fuelled by britain's agenda by concessions and changes to the treaties, which the majority do not want.
in brighton, at the annual meeting, tuc decided that they do not want it either if they erode social protection.
we could even call it dave and george's' selfie' agenda.
the prime minister and chancellor are attending bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, are giving a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and say they have won allies for reform.
it is just about me.
my european friend, who wants britain with a outward perspective under the roof of the eu -- " do not leave ourselves with france, " berlin says -- suggests that more ministers and narrow officials from some capitals have reached the point where they do not care whether they remain or leave.
angela merkel, cautiously german chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her position before her situation shaels, as happened with thatcher (11 years), mitterrand (14) and kohl (16), who have been too long.
in 2017, french president françois hollande will be re elected or replaced.
his power is also in decline.
poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, spain a left-wing one.
it is hard to believe that they will help the english who pose pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent scotland from out of britain - something that they do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
thus, some ministers could even plan to make remarks that do not help, in the style of the snp, in the campaign for the referendum referendum in 2017 to speed up the brexite process, my father suggests.
" renegotiation was fixed " and " britain has achieved nothing value from renegotiation. "
europeans know on their skin how acthetic fleet street can be and how sceptical the oligarchic press barons are who who view the eu with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by tony benn who has ratified our entry since 1973 into report 2: 1.
perhaps he remember the ely of boris johnson, the euro-un, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a co-ent of brussels.
ed miliband knew his enemies.
they have included the mixending of non-taxpayers, foreigners who telephone fraud and pseudo non-domi who own most of the important newspapers.
in fact, tony blair sees him about the same but he realised that when you are closed in a cfe with a nervous gorla, you have to give the bananas to distract his attention from thinking of eating at midday and again to tea.
miliband was, in fact, more sofder than blair in opposition to cameron's idea of referendum, as blair made a concession to the principle to the abandoned eu constitution, buried by french and dutch voters in 2005, who gave him an exit card.
the media did not forgive him for that either.
but jeremy corbyn, who reached my friend through the back monday at westminster -- i told him not to consume his time with me anymore -- seems to be in danger to adopt the murdoch strategy for boycotting neil kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
it may take time, but it must develop coherent strategy for co-operation strategy with the media, not with me, but certainly with andrew marr whose position at the bbc left a vacation sunday.
corbyn's official position towards europe is what i would call development with leniency.
he says we would like to stay in a reformed eu.
most of those who disagree with conservatives conservative' angism' could agree to that.
that is hilary said " a benn, but not a bennite " benn on radio and tv this week, when his researcher struggled not to recognise that the appointment of john mcdonnell by corbyn as minister " in the shadow " on financial issues was a bad idea.
he reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on tv to be unfair to labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing his job in the cabinet.
hilary's fight has been more attractive.
but the fight to stay " in any situation " -- benn's expression -- does not correspond to what mcdonnell, nor does to what jc told colleagues and lawmakers at a private meeting monday night.
regardless of the image corbyn wants to convey out - remember it has also also made me aware - the discipline of messages remains important in the television age and in in particular, the varvarieties of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and treason.
it is right not to give cameron a' yes' ticket in europe, allowing him to take the good support of labour in the referendum campaign, as mcdonnell said.
simon jenkins certainly believes that.
but the basic sohistry of mcdonnell and corbyin with regard to eu membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a hesitant discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcicism of small differences is a central dogma.
as with sophistry on nato - tom watson is adamant that the jc will not campaign for abandon -- foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
why should paris or berlin in political capital - and there there are suspicious voters - for concessions towards britain when everything could be pointless?
the us is already quite disappointed about the weak english military performance in iraq, libya and syria, even with a conservative government that is cutting costs, as i was reminded at launching the british influence security forum on monday.
specialists criticise england public health department decision on electronic cigarettes
according to researchers, claims by a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of whom with links to the tobacco industry.
specialists from the british medical journal (bmj) 's editorial team joined lancet in criticising the evidence used by the england department of public health (ppc) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
sanovic published the " reference " report last month and described it as a " complex analysis of evidence. "
some researchers, however, have questioned the robustness of data and have pointed their finger at links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
an article in the medical magazine lancet last month attacked the " extraordinarily fragile basis " on which the main conclusion founded founded.
two other researchers writing in bmj questioned their claims and basing them " on solid soil or moving sand. "
martin mckee, a professor of european public health at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, and simon capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at liverpool university, said, " a fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on proof of effectiveness. "
they said they expect the claims of derogations that " current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking " are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
in reality, only one meeting attended by 12 people led to the elaboration of a model for multi-criteria decision-making analysis (mcda) sumsummarising their views on the negative effects associated with various products containing a nicotina; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research work.
mckee and capewell, or said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called euroswiss health, whose executive director said to have received funding from british american tobacco in the past to conduct an independent study.
it also validated the bat's accreditation in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
they added that one of 12 participants in the meeting said funding from a producer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding there are reports would have received from the cigarette and tobacco manufacturing company, philip morris international.
no arguments have been provided on the basis of which members of the ship were selected, but these include some " frgs " known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare funding funding in the work of work.
other participants in the meeting are not known for tobacco control expertise.
the head of the tobacco control station in the blast also attended the meeting.
the research work drafted by the group " convincingly musup " that there is lack of " solid evidence of the detrimental effect most products have according to most criteria, " mckee and capewell said.
however, in the screening report, none of these links or limitations are mentioned.
mckee and capewell said claims the claims that " so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers " are premature.
professor kevin fenton, director of the health department within the, says he has been responded in the past to claims in bmj.
he said " electronic cigarettes significantly less harmful than smoking. "
one in two people smoking all their lives lolosing their lives because of this vice.
all the evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic health cigarettes is minor compared, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
contracting has a clear duty to inform the public of the information arising and those that do not out of evidence, particularly given the high level of public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
annually, about 80,000 people lose their lives due to a smoking-related disease and the annual costs by the national health system due to smoking reach gbp 2 billion.
by expressing the current evidence clear - that although the use of electronic cigarettes is not free of risk, they only only a fraction of the detrimental effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national debt.

violinist david grimal: during the era there were no world tournamentbach.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people working, artists rather than commercial representatives.
french violinist david grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as the singer but also as initiator of a less ordinary project, downright' strange', as he himself says, les dissonances - an orchestra of international soloists and talented musicians, interprets a symphony repertoire without having a conduc, makes it at least curiosity.
les dissonances was at the enescu festival with two performances this year: a performance, sunday, in which the solist was david grimal, founder of the orchestra, and one month, when violinist xavier phillips at the forefront, with works composed by enescu being nelipsite.
both performances, held on the athens scene, showed the public another to interpret classical music.
les dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at the time, the only classic musical whole in which there is no conductor.
the conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
it is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - they speak of instrumentbox, not of composers.
they are trained as' specialised workers'.
they themselves have the impression that they need a dilimtor.
on the other hand of the scene, for the public, all the music notistory focuses on the conductor.
and so business, the music industry, commercimarketing.
therefore, we are not talking about music.
so, if we look at this world, we have qualified workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and a public who cannot listen, but he must look, which and is stupid, " david grimal says.
the violinist tells that the change in the way music does came followed the " musical deception " in his singer career.
i was like a high-level athlete who had to the same exercise throughout around the world with different orchestras, earn a lot of money and bring money to the music industry.
10 years ago, when i were around 30 years, i found this very depressing, because we we no longer found creativity and fraternity in this system.
so i have found no sense to continue along this path.
that is how i decided to create les dissonances.
this was in 2004, and at the time no one was doing so without a conductor:' the musical world, is highly conservative, did not want such projects'.
" how do you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no ego ego? " the artist asks.
david grimal acknowledges that les dissonaces is " a luxury, " saying none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
in 10 years of existence of the le, the lack of a conductor was not proved to be a hindrance in the music act: " curiously, we weigh a a complex repertoire,, simpler it seems seems, because all musicians are forced to be present in opera and not just in a role, " grimal says, adding that sunday's performance, " we were 74 conductors on the stage. "
in grimal's view, the enăescu festival is' very courageous', precisely because it has also invited les dissonances:' an extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras in the world playing and 3 times a day present, and in the midst of these orchestras you you also invited this strange group'.
in a temple of orchestrated tradition, such as the enănescu festival, there is the place and interest in something different, breaks breaks barriers.
speaking about enescu's work, the violinist acknowledges he feels romanian music of the famous romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced enescu works on his repertoire.
grimal notes that enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is when we talk about george enescu and romanian music, " because there is also a george enescu who has done french music. "
grimal is advocating for changing the way classical musical education is done, believing that' the musprofession, as it is organised today, has a death flavour' and that' the future of music represents music itself'.
we do not need to make the world tour 5 times a year if it serves nothing.
during the age of bach, there were no world tours.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people working, who were artists rather than commercial representatives.
for me, organising concerts, festivals, tournaments, the release of album, are all formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done at the service of music.
if not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
to illustrate this phenomenon, david grimal set an example to romanian products before and post joining the european union:' in romania, before entering the eu, you had good vegetables and meat'.
to enter the eu, you have had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
production and agriculture end up at the service of supermarkets, as is the case in france.
the same happens with music, it makes the same logic.
les dissonances makes tomatoes perhaps not too beautiful, but when we cut them are real red.
in an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music do not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with education policy.
" if we considered -- as the koreans, the chinese, the japanese do - that western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity we we reintroduce his learning to school, we would reintroduce concerts on television and through this education there would no longer need to sell musical by-products, " grimal believes.
there are certainly things in classical musical education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarised.
it depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing at an instrument and, above all, a musician.
this is a completely different education if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) it must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it is something else.
after your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? " the french artist asks by smiling.
grimal shows that for artists, the reward of another kind of doing music comes precisely from overcoming this status of' soldier'', overcoming what' they believe are their limits':' musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and that is why zsmilators are coming out'.
david grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist at the " festival of ideas, " a discussion with the public held at the george enescu international festival by the aspen romania.

do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child, who like films?
it gives him the opportunity to get a star.
in september, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, keen to reach future stars and 8 from 16 years old, cinema city is looking for " small big voices, " giving them an extraordinary opportunity to duplicate two figures in a famous animation film.
if emphasis was placed in classical drawings on bringing the voice of the actor to the specificnature of the animated character, recently, also taken into account to the creation recently, those who are to interpret the voices, and they are usually well-known actors.
cinema city romania, however, wants to discover new voices, which is why we are starting an unprecedented campaign.
we want to find the right voice and we challenge parents to roll their children in our contest.
they will have special experience, because characters are sympatic and aftershocks are funny.
" the children will enjoy themselves and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors, " said ioana ionescu, marketing manager of cinema city romania.

fedex winners mixed, lower fiscal projections for 2016
fedex said disappointing results for the last quarter, with the supply giant reducing profit estimates for the whole as year due to low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
the company also said it plans to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
during the same period last year, fedex announced that he would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
the company's shares dropped by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the opening bell sound on wednesday.
fedex corp. said he expects to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next may, with 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimate.
analysts expected $10.8, according to a survey conducted by factset.
the falling estimate comes despite rising prices by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 january and the higher land transport surcharge of large or high yweipackages, which will apply since november.
the company said it still expects increased gains from the previous year as a result of reduced costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
president and general director fred smith said " the company faces a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially as regards global production and trade. "
employment plans during the holiday were announced a day after ups conttor said it plans to employ 90,000-95,000 workers, about the same number of employment it made last year.
in the quarter ending on august 31st, fedex won $692m, 6% more than the previous year.
earnings per action were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per action by 12 analysts who responded to the zacks investment research poll.
profit increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
six analysts who participated in the zacks poll estiestimated $12.23 billion.
fedex has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, which led to a stagnation in revenues from its unit express.
but the explosion in online shopping salched the results of the fedex ground division.
in the last quarter, revenues from ground division increased by 29%, but operational revenues stalled practically due to higher costs for large packages and their own insurance.
the express unit registered an increase in revenues due to higher basic tariffs, while revenues from the freight division have fallen due to rising costs.
in pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, fedex shares dropped by usd 3.85 or 2.5%, to usd 150.15.
on tuesday at the closure dropped by 11% year-on-year and 17 compared from the record maximum on 11 june.
at the most awaited meeting in years, policy policymakers makers within the federal reserve will spend two days this week around a honduran mahtable on 27 legs to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
above them, at an end of the chamber of the central bank, a dirty us ing will be termined.
the map aims to recall that janet l. yellen, edf chairman, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all.
the central bank has been given a dual task from congress: to maximise the employment rate in the us and maintain price stability.
since the great great economic crisis, edf leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
and this third task could be factor x in a decision that is difficult to predict, which will be announced on tuesday, and which will determine whether the us economy is ready to be disapart by the unprecedented stimulus offered by the almost zero short-term interest rate in force starting end late 2008.
even though the majority of data indicate a strong economy, the recent agturmoil in the global financial markets could frighten edf officials already cautious of adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
" obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will follow " said said lindsey m. piegza, chief economist at brokeraj stifel nicolaus & co.
" but i think that if they looked for an excuse not to increase interest rates, growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait longer, " she said.
there is no consensus on the decision that the edf will make, which in itself causing instability in the financial market.
about half of the economists recently questioned by bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
however, the financial markets expect the edf to postpone, with a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30%.
this would indicate a decrease on the stock exchange if the edf increases interest rates unless those who draft policies cushithe blow by vowing to take a long time before the next growth.
on tuesday, the industrial average dow jones moved up 228.89 points, or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
the momentum has been triggered by expectations that decision makers will maintain the stable interest rate this week, said john lonski, chief economist at moody's capital markets research group.
" it would be surprising for the edf to increase the interest rate at this moment, " lonski said.
if edf decision makers did so,' should act in thoroughly in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets'.
other experts have said that an increase in interest rates would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the edf acts.
just a month ago, the edf seemed to be on track to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the force of us recovery.
yellen said in the spring and summer that he expects an increase in interest rates this year despite objections raised by liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
although job creation slowed down in august, labour market growth was strong this year.
unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the edf as full employment.
salary gains showed signs of growth.
and although inflation has continued not to achieve the central bank's annual goal, edf decision makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of oil prices falling oil prices.
the economy " can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tension in the labour market, " said ian shepherdson, chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics.
however, the global financial markets began entering fibrilations at the end of this month, after china devalued its currency.
the industrial average dow jones fell by 16% below the record maximum reached in may, as investors feared that a slowing in the chinese economy would plundown world growth.
the square reculmarked somewhat this month, with the dow index now about 10% below the maximum in may.
for edf decision makers, agitation on the market is added to the complex calculation of time of interest interest rates.
" without what has happened on the financial markets and news of the weakening of the chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be more firm at the sitting, " said stephen d. oliner, an experienced researcher at the ucla ziman center for real estate and a former official edf.
now he expects to wait at least a month to better manage the effects better.
" there is a great deal of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the us economy and almost do not have data on which to be based later after events in china, " oliner said.
the well-being of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the edf, so should practically not be taken into account in decision making.
in reality, however, the edf has become monetary authority worldwide.
in recent years, the central bank's influence has been huge.
simply alluding by the then president ben s. s. bernanke, in 2013, that the edf could' narrow' monetary expansion has triggered earthquake in the world markets.
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly emanating, edf officials are expected not only only monitor the progress made in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to better interpret the world economy.
his decision-making process is " more art than science, " said zachary karabell, head of the global strategy department at welfare management firm envestnet inc.
jeffrey lacker, president of the federal reserve bank in richmond, va, said this month that " the edf has an oversized reaction record to changes in the financial market that appear not to be related to economic bases. "
lacker, a member with voting vote of the federal commission on the open market, a decision-making body which supported supported an increase in interest rates, provided the decisions of 1998-99 as an example.
a financial crisis that has affected asia has led the edf to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, " despite implications with limited identification for us development, " lacker said.
a year later, edf officials returned to those falls.
the edf should raise the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the market earthquake in 2008, said adam s. posen, a former member of the commission setting an interest rate at the bank of england.
the last turbulent period is far from that level, he said.
" we certainly do not want to end up in a position to fear an increase in the interest rate because the markets have upset, " said posen, president of the peterson institute for international economics.
the reserve federal act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes about it, i do not think it should take premature action.

4 people their lives after police fired rubber bullets in protesters in nepal
four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern nepal after police fired rubber bullets at the crowd demonstrating against the country's new proposed constitution, an official said on wednesday.
the violence occurred late tuesday in rupandehi district, about 280km west of the capital of kathmandu.
according to bishnu prasad dhakal, head of the district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station, while some threw stones stones and molotov cocktails.
mr dhakal said police forces used tear gas before then fired the fire before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
he said, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
it was not clear as soon why rubber bullets, which they are known to kill kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
the clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of nepal, where members of the madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
protests also occurred in western nepal, where the tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes triggered on 10 august,
when four key political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces -- a major step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in nepal, a country governed centrally for hundreds of years.

burden-reducing surgery could be useful in case diabetcs with easy obesity
the benefits of surgery to reduce hardship for light obesity people, with type 2-didiabet, could remain for at least five years, according to a new study.
it is still premature to say whether light obesity diabetcs live more after loss-related surgical intervention than those following unhirurgical treatments.
" it takes a long time to centralise mortality data, " said dr robin blackstone, a specialist on obesity surgery, car wrote an article on the new study in jama surgery.
operations for loss of weight, dubbed and and bariric surgery, use various methods to reduce dental.
they reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
over the years, surgery on bariric barrier has proved effective in the treatment of type 2-sugar diabetes, but most studies were carried out on people with morbida obesity, with a corporate mass index (imc) 35 or higher.
the imc, a unit of measure of equal-to weight, is considered normal between 18.5 to 24.9.
the imc value of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and people with more than 30 are considered obese.
you can calculate your imc by accessing: 1.usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
for the new study, researchers at the general min-sheng hospital in taiwan used the data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariric surgery -- bypass gastric and gastrectomie in manson -- in the medical treatment of 2-2 diabetes to people with light obesity.
the imc mediu to people who suffered surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
meanwhile, the imc to people who received unhirurgical treatments against sugar diabes remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
of those who suffered surgical intervention, the sugar diabetes sold fully to 36% and in part to 28%.
in the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, the sugar diabetes was fully ed to only 1% and partly to only 2% of the subjects.
in addition, control of terial tension, trigliceridees and the ldl cholesterol' bad' were generally better in the surgical group, " the authors concluded.
researchers also monitored the guin level of hemoglobina a1c, which reflects the level of glicemia over time.
researchers write that the best level of hemoglobina a1c is below 7%.
after surgical intervention, the average level of hemoglobina a1c fell from around 9% to about 6%.
but in the group treated by medical methods, it has been maintained at around 8%.
but this improved " licemic control " -- reflected in the improved levels of hemoglobina a1c -- has not reduced the mortality rate to five years, according to chief researcher dr chih-cheng hsu and colleagues.
the research team also compared average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
in the fifth year, compared to the gastrectomie group in manson, bypass surgery group lost more in weight (18.7 compared to 14.2kg), registered more considerable falls in in imc value (7.4 compared to 5.1) and hemoglobina ac c 3.1% compared 2.1%%) and presented higher sugar probability.
although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery five five years, there is evidence of a study by heavy weipeople in sweden that life-long surgery, says blackstone of arizona university, the faculty of medicine - phoenix.
in the swedish study, obese people who suffered bariric intervention presented a probability of around 29% lower to die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival for patients who suffered surgical intervention blackblackstone called it an optimistic optimistic for people with the imc under 35 interested in the procedure.
" this is the point where this work is critical, because it says this surgical intervention is safe in the lower c group, " without increasing the risk of death or renal disease, she says.
blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start -- taking weight seriously then the patient's imc reaches 27-30.
" i think we wait too long before we urge the people to take this seriously, " she said.
i believe that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have shorcircuit their bodies by disecting them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
" it is impossible for everyone to come to europe " -- dalai lama - rt news
europe could not receive all refugees, the dalai lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the situation crisis in the middle east.
the tibetan buddhist leader has called for an call put an end to the violence in the mother countries of refugees.
the dalai lama spoke about the problem of the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the dalai lama centre for compassion in oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to britain.
he said that in the current situation, humanity's interests should prevail over the interests of each nation and even every continent.
he also stressed that while admirable, the response of western european countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
" it is impossible for everyone to come to europe, " he said in his speech.
although the dalai lama praised germany and austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
" this is the wonderful care for several thousand refugees, but we also need to think about long-term solutions to bring sincere peace and development, especially through education, to muslim countries, " he stressed.
basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
we need to reduce the use of force.
force has never solved these problems, " he added.
on the issue of violence, the dalai lama also commented on george bush's actions following the terrorist attacks on 11 september, saying that the violent response from the us generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
after the events of 11 september, i expressed my condolences in a letter to president bush and told him to resolve this problem without appealing to violence.
i know his reasons were strong but used force and led to unexpected consequences, " the dalai lama said.
four-fold increase in children who have ved detergent hands over the past 4 years.
according to georgia's anti-poisvire centre, the us anti-poisoning centres have reported an increase of around 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed up detergent deterof hands with high alcohol content.
according to dr gaylord lopez, director of georgia's anti-poisrare centre, cases of inggthe detergents of hands children under the age of 12 reported at anti-poisoning centres climbed from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
" children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the chamber, " lopez told cnn.
lopez said that some children were deliberately drinking detergent and others do so to impress their friends to respond to challenges on social media.
films featuring teenagers such as detergent gent can be watched on youtube to create cheap drink.
teenagers are said to have mixup water detergents with mouth with alcohol in order to obtain a more drink.
younger children can be drawn to the attractive smell of detergents.
" a child does not think that he is ming them, " lopez says.
many of the most attractive types (of detergent hands) are perfumsmoes.
gowberberglass detergents, strugure, the orange are the most attractive to children.
hands detergents contains about 45-95% of alcohol.
young children in particular, only a few freeallowed es can cause alcohol poisoning.
" it is highly concentrated alcohol, " dr stephen thornton, medical director of the anti-poisoning centre at kansas university hospital, told fox 4 channel in kansas city.

why i witness execution in oklahoma
later today, except for late legal intervention, i will see how a man is sentenced to death.
if it happens, and i hope it does not happen, i will sit in a room for observers in the execution chamber of the state prison oklahoma and see how richard glossip is executed by managing lethal injection.
he asked me to be one of four official witnesses his death.
the invitation first came in january, through his best friend, and although i was shocked, i accepted.
as the good day approaches, i am appat the idea.
so why do?
i agreed because i thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
it would offer a single perspective.
true, journalists can witness executions in america and, because applications usually exceed the number of places available, a macabra ra tery tery takes place to decide who will be elected.
oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
those elected will view impartially execution.
i cannot do that.
i would stand next to richard glossip's closest friends, in addition i have developed my own connection with him over months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two two a half hours.
i like the kind.
we often laua great deal when we speak.
prison authorities say i cannot witness a journalist as well, so i will not be allowed to have a cargo and a pix in me to note what i see.
i will have to try to remember all the details.
a journalist from oklahoma accused me twitter of compromising my impartiality.
that is the lesson.
it tells the holder's story as he wants, it gains access.
i complained about it.
he acknowledged that " he could have made better', but but i am still wrong.
richard glossip did not agree with some of the things i have said and written.
he does not tell me what to write, and i would not do so even if asked asked me.
i told him that he could remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
but he wants an international report to be present that writes on the subject.
it believes that if it dies, advertising will help the movement against the capital punishment.
kim bellware, a reporter for huffington post, will join me.
if you want to know more about the case, you listen the series of multimedia files that we have made.
i will not come back here to all details.
i cannot say with certainty that richard glossip is innocent.
his actions following the murder of barry van treese is guilty of complicity.
but i think he is probably not to guilty guilty of murder.
i certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
i think his execution is wrong.
and i will look at it by dying from this perspective.
i cannot claim to be totally objective.
for this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
from me, you will find out how it is to watch a man i like dying unnecessarily.
peter moody claims stewarans try spy him, threatens to withdraw from races
peter moody said stewarans racing victoria tried to infiltrate a truck into his codes last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the races.
it launched an attack against stewarans and the integrity department of racing victoria, saying they are conducting a personal campaign against him, a drop that filled the glass being lady tatai's removal from the race due to treatment administered on race day.
moody told fair media fax that it has always tried to do the best for the field of flights and is being put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome to rulleaders' whtest, for which he has no explanation.
for 18 months, he swallowed up his words on spies statements and did not want to resemble' vulpea that does not reach grapes'.
" i was not going to say anything about that and i have kept quiet for a long time, but sometimes you reach such a high level of frustration that everything is suddenly breaking up, " moody said.
it is a fact that it has continued.
sometimes you react and have to suffer the consequences, and i will have to live with what i have said.
i night, i will go home and sleep peacefully.
i want to go my head high and i want the owners i am working to see that i am striving to give them the best.
since they start to believe that this is not the case, i have to give up on er work.
at that point, i will have to think about what i will do with my certification.
earlier, moody threw the bomb in an interview with racing.com saying the integrity department had tried to spy on its graables.
" eighteen months ago, terry bailey, dayle brown and dr brian stewart stood in a room with a man -- whose name i will say if asked -- and offered to engage to my graables to provide information about the work there, " moody told racing.com.
i obviously consider me a trisor.
if that is the case, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
robert roulston, former president of rvl, david moodie, current president of rvl and bernard saundry, current managing ceo of rvl, knew at the time and i know today.
should i think that is something personal?
is it necessary for the pnr to start having the backbone and can hold people outside the living accountable for what is happening in the industry?
do i have a bad influence on industry?
so bad is my influence on industry?
perhaps that is how others see others.
perhaps it has to take me a license and give me aside, and i have no doubt that the statements i are making now could lead them to think about this.
however, i have reached the point where i no longer care, and that saddens me.
it saddens me very greatly.
i will put pressure and lead them to make a decision.
my family supports me and can leave.
the traitor's frustration grew with the long-standing investigation into balbaltesting involving the leaders, and the removal prompted him to say he could " put his license on the table. "
moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the undefeated champion black caviar, labelled the race day treatment rule as " ridiculous " after applying on its feet of a catbowing le with namol or silver, which violates the rules.
it violates flights' rules.
i have to take full responsibility for this, " he says.
one of my employees mistaksluly put them on their foot.
it could happen last night.
it could have happened yesterday, which happened.
it happened on race day.
moody could be disqualified for three months for the race day treatment of enforce cuboings, for which the stewarans opened an investigation.
this is a ke.
the people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
" we all understand rules are needed, but it went too far, " moody said.
driver who hit, fled accident scene in cobram arrested
police arrested a man after a collision with a bicicist produced in cobram at the weekend and followed by fleeing from the scene of the accident.
the cyclist was flopped by helicopter to royal melbourne hospital, seriously injured after being hit early saturday by a car on the murray valley highway.
police representatives say the driver of the car did not stop to help injured injured cyclist.
on monday, a 50-year-old man, surrendered to police in shepparton.
he is said to be charged with fleeing from the site of the accident, failing to provide the first help and other road crimes.
the cyclist, a 40-year-old man, from cobram, remains remains admitted in a stable state.
coach melbourne storm, craig bellamy, responds to opponents in wrestling charges.
coach melbourne storm, craig bellamy named criticism of his team's plates tactics as " distorted topics " raised by nrl's two two main trunites.
coach sydney roosters, trent robinson, said the referees allowed players in the storm to " take them in the tranta " the team in a match nernervous of storm in the qualification final late friday in sydney.
brisbane broncos coach wayne bennett, made a slight reference to storm after his team's victory in the north queensland cowboys qualifying match late saturday, when he called the match a " demonstration " of the rugby league and said two two teams ququensensland were not good on wrestling.
bellamy jumped in defending the plates tactics addressed by his team and said the players simply focused on " contact " when they like.
bellamy says he gained confidence after two key coaches criticised his team, meaning they were concerned that storm would defeat them.
" and things do not stop there -- i did not hear trent robinson to complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2, " bellamy said on wednesday.
i can guarantee that we have not changed anything every year in our defensive systems or techniques, so only as in the last six weeks, we have really emphasised contact in plates, and so we have changed the situation.
trent has been in the post for three years, and obviously obviously has a wonderful team so so is probably not used to losing, and it was a shock to him.
we know how it is always the case during this period of year.
bellamy contradicted bennett's idea of " animating football, " recalling bennett's mentor st george-illawarra dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing " boring " football.
wayne talks about palilling football.
he argued his opinion comparing his game saturday with our game play evening and talked about how palpitilling the game was, " bellamy said.
i remember that in 2010, st george received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and wayne said he was not interested in it how black under butter.
but now it has a team that can play what we would see as palpitilling football, especially because of quick young midfielders.
this kind of game you want to do it when you have such players.
he brought that argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt their style of play - not team has two midfielders like anthony ony ford and ben hunt hunt to play so.
it gives me more confidence because they are saying this because they are somewhat concerned about the match with us.
six weeks ago they probably did not think us when they they of the major matches.
bellamy also stressed that the storm-roosters match was a tougher expanframe over the score compared to the match between broncos and cowboys.
the broncos match was probably a good match, have we not yet it yet how much the score 16-12?
our match ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, does that mean palilling game?
or does pitating mean making breaks and not marching?
there are plans for me.
if i talk about us, it means that at some point could meet them.
storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home either with north queensland cowboys or with cronulla sharks in next saturday's campaign-trial final in aami park, with tickets going for sale starting next next morning.

friendsfest: the edy series that has taught us important lessons about male friendship
the absence of similar figures in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the past 15 years.
in 2013, the suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in britain, and three three times frequent frequent men men than women.
in an attempt to address the problem, the campaign against unfortunate life (campaign against living miserably (calm) designated 2015 to the year of the man, wanting to call into question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
friendship is at the heart of the fight for the success of this challenge.
a recent study of more than 2000 high school students showing depression-depression symptoms concluded that if the patient is surrounded by sufficiently many friends " with a healthy state of mood, " his chances of recovery double.
similarly, for people who are not suppressed, a circle of mental healthy friends halhalving the likelihood of mental disorders emerging.
of course, in order for friendship to have an effect, it must above all be accessible.
in this era of communication dominated by social media, where emphasis is placed on style and not substance, the immediate character of the response often takes priority before meaningful contact.
our digital lives have doubled the need to create the apparent of a strong, open to fun and successful personality, even though reality reality it is isolation that dominates.
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsece values; money, the image, social status, all at the cost of values intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which even deeply affect our mental health.
the billionaire aire inventor of a video game recently explained that the money really does not buy happiness.
the beauty of series friends was to focus to the idea.
characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, they showed by interacting as friends.
the humour of the frequent embrace of joey and chandler, when they look at football in the convenient seats and the passion of ross for rachel came from it it being known that men can associate themselves with this situation, even though they often bothered to completely explore their feelings.
as a social worker explained to me:'... my role in listening to people with the trend of suicide and depressed has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference'.
often, people who appeal to us do not feel able to speak to friends.
his old saying doing alone is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
friends are one of the series that come to mind when i try to offer more psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long term.
the series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
however much objective objective, outside intervention helps, via phone, people ended up in times of desperair, long-term support comes from the family and close friends.
so, if you participate this weekend in the friendsfest organised by comedy central, with the full drafting of shooting platforms to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to coffee in the central perk.
or, even better, if you see someone alone in starbucks, you smilile and welcome.
it is never known what difference your friendship could make.
friends broadcast on comedy central from beginning to the end -- all 236 episodes -- like hook friendsfest
di maria marks, helps bsp put o aside
angel di maria celebrates blaise matuidi and cavani cavinson after scoring against malmo.
angel di maria marked in her debut match at the champions league on tuesday and helped the bsp impose sweden's malmo.
we are still presenting to to you chically and your reaction to play.
angel di maria and edinson cavani did their job, paris saint-germain starting a series of matches in the champions league groups, with a reassuring 2-0 victory against malmo in a match tuesday on park des printi.
di maria marked in less than four minutes after the start of her debut match in the bsp team champions league, bringing france's champions to an advantage though they missed a number of occasions before securing her advantage with the goal k's kmark in the 61st minute.
coming in the group a with real madrid and sahtior donetk, paris needed a strong start against the swedish champions because the objective of the french team is not only to qualify for optimround but also to improve the journey to the quarof finals in each of the last three tournaments.
but while they took the points, laurent blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with zlatan ibrahimovic who wasted the goal opportunity before being replaced by the team in his hometown and the club at which brilliant career began in 1999.
" it is not easy to earn home or in moving to the champions league, so the 2-0 victory is problems problems our opponents opponents sets a comfortable difference from the next-classes, even though there are still issues that we need to improve during the season, " blanc says.
this is a good sign.
we wanted to win and did so, although i am sorry that we failed to give one or two more goals.
ibrahimovic returned after injury to one of three changes to the paris team with a 2-2 milestone at home by borghex in the 1st league at the weekend, but a di maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
when he was transferred from manchester united last month, the argentine offensive midfielder was appointed the man who will lead the bsp to the next level to europe and demonstrated this when he tased in marco verratti's care behind malmo's defence before he evned more than johan wiland, in the long corner on the right of the gate.
but if someone expected the bsp to win victory by mering its fingers, they were disappointed.
malmo, who defeated celtic in play-off to reach this stage and has entered the field with nine holders on national teams, with a defence from five people and two defence midfielders, was a strong adversary.
but their attack was not impressive, with an exception being the shot to nikola djurdjic who moved to kevin trapp in the 34th minute.
instead, the bsp players slowed down the pace several times, giving some unnecessary passes and and not completing interventions interventions, ibrahimhimovic who missed no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then replaced by cavani even after the game has resumed.
ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skilled in supporting her colleagues, with his care di di maria sent to a shot devited by wilwilover her gate in the 52nd minute.
the second goal was finally scored after an hour passed from the match, thanks to cavani, uruguayan who scored the sixth season goal after ibrahimovic passed from the belt of maxwell.
that goal removed the hope of malmo that they would rebalance the score and only a superb stop by wiland from a distance to reject david luiz kept the final score before the new entof ezequiel lavezzi was cancelled a goal in the extension.
the team's norwegian coach in malmo, age hareid, later said the bsp was a class class and that " the last match we played in the champions league was last december. "
since then, we have only played in the swedish league, which is not of the same level.
qualifications are not enough.
below the palace for the bsp.
they made an excellent game.

activity report by the tvr leadership, rejected in the committees: stelian tanase risks dismissal
parliament's culture committees rejected on wednesday the activity report by the governing board of romanian television society for 2014.
to reject the report, 17 lawmakers voted, one against the rejection (senator varujan vosganian) and one abstained.
the text of the report will be submitted to the joint permanent offices.
they will probably decide next week.
at the next joint plenary it will be debated.
" i think that given this situation it will be done relatively quickly, " said senate committee of culture chairman georgica severin.
he added that " it was of common sense " for the tvr leadership to also present at this meeting, as no representatives of the tvr leadership was present at the meeting of culture committees.
it was common sense that the tvr leadership to be present because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or something like this.
the invitation came to members as early last night, with an approximating hour that we did not know any new either, but today, after the meeting of joint offices, i personally sent a fax to the tvr leadership by inviting it.
i believe that when you are convened, you are a budget employee, paid for from public taxes and convened to a joint committee meeting even if you do not like alive.
" because it is your obligation to service, you are in an institution subordinate to parliament, " severin said after a meeting of the joint committees of parliament's culture.
he added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the sitting on the basis of the negative opinion of budget committees.
debts also saw as they continued, came up with the idea that this year it have been up to,, but not not paid from the historical ones.
" i remind you that not from my fault or anyone else in these committees that that aggression was lost with the banks and the crack, there are clear management problems, " severin said.
he added that after the activity report is rejected by the joint plenary, elections will follow for a new governing board and it would elect the institution's director-general.
i do not know who will be proposed for this post.
wonwill not be done.
what is important is to make political decisions in order for this institution works.
i am not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will sit queue here and beat beat.
i hope that those who decide, parliament's plenary, with their vote they will very lessly choose the people who will lead the tvr.
there must be people who know what is happening there, have have experience and have a great deal of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
i do not know who will be, if you ask me what qualities they must have - a common sense in attitudes attitude towards ners because it is a malaltasy of petitions coming from employees, complaints, redundancies.
" when you receive such complaints 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation that is a disaster, " concluded the chairman of the senate committee of culture.
although he did not appear to parliament, president-general of tvr stelian tanase sent a letter to the president of the chamber of deputies valeriu zgonea for parliament to consider a series of measures that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of economic and political independence for public television, including the indexation of tv tax.
in the letter, stelian tanase calls, in addition to indexindexation of tv tax, for amendment and completion of hg 978 / 2003 on the tax on public television television, in order to update provisions at the level of technological change every day, as well as to regulate the control procedure in the payment of payment tv tax and and the finding of and and application of sanctions and penalties.
he also wants a provision to be issued providing for extending the obligation for all suppliers of electricity to become srtv mandates for collecting the tv tax by involving anre in regulating this activity.
in his opinion, it is necessary to set a maximum ceiling of 5% of the revenue fee.
stelian tanase is calling for a reduction in the vat rate for specific activities to public television and the contribution to the cnc from 15% to 3%, as well for changes to the 41 / 1994 law, in a view to the possibility of receiving budget / funding allocations to purchase licenses for major cultural and sports sports events -- the world football championship, the golden sta, eurovision.
he argues that srtv will default in the coming months given that labour law obliges the employer to enforce court rulings, even though they are not final and wage rights are honoured as a priority over any other obligation.
the tvr administration has made constant efforts to cut staff spending and tv production.
" this has reduced travel and other cost-generating activities, a number of trade contracts were renegotiated, and in late july, tvr r station was closed, " president tvr's letter said.
young sanappreciate that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied through its own efforts alone.
" without the support of state institutions -- government, parliament, the presidency -- romanian television will sooner or later be unable to carry out its public mission further, " the letter noted.
the leadership of the chamber of deputies decided to send the letter to the committee on culture.

ilie sarbu voted as vice-president at court of auditors
parliament's plenary voted wednesday to appoint psd senator ilie serb u, prime minister victor ponta victor sowife, as vice president of the audit authority at the court of auditors.
according to mediafax, 290 " in " and 108 " votes were registered.
the vote was secret with ballots.
pnl representatives were the only ones to vote against this proposal, digi24 reports.

the psd senator will serve as vice president of the audit authority at the court of auditors, left free after ioan anton was revoked, following a decision by the constitutional court in september 2014, found to have been appointed unconstitutional.

ponta, charged of uncontrolled libel, irrational claims
hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto harshly condemned early wednesday, romanian romanian prime minister victor ponta assertions that political decision makers in hungary are " nothing better than those in syria, libya or other countries fleeing refugees. "
" yesterday, victor ponta lost self-control and, through his irrational claims, he offends the entire hungary, " the hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
civilised european politicians do not say such uncontrolled slander.
" his remarks have only one explanation: he has completely lost its support in domestic politics in romania, " added the head of hungarian diplomacy, according to mti.
in a post on facebook late tuesday, prime minister victor ponta said he wants to draw attention and sanction the behaviour of senior hungarian government officials, who, in his view " are a disgrace to eu culture and values. "
i do not want to respond to the challenges posed from hungarian government representatives.
" these are a disgrace to the culture and values of the european union; and in anti-semitic attitudes, and as to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis! " ponta said on facebook.
the romanian prime minister added that he favours sensible and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, praising that brutalities and aggressive laws would not solve the problem.
barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in hungary, in the heart of europe, they are political decision makers nothing better than those in syria, libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing!
" i believe in solidarity, in sensible and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of european values -- what we have seen in hungary in recent days, runs completely contradiction to precisely these goals and values! " the head of the romanian executive stressed.
earlier on tuesday, hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto described " mere lies " " romanian prime minister victor ponta's remarks about hungary's management of the refugee crisis, describing those claims as inappropriate for a leader in the 21st century, according to mti.
the head of hungarian diplomacy also noted on tuesday that the romanian prime minister's " extremist and misleading remarks " concern the domestic political crisis in romania, and made it clear that budapest apologises from the romanian side.
szijjarto referred to a statement by prime minister victor ponta monday.
what i have said and always say is that i am against xenophobic speeches, the idea of closing borders, like all those who come are terrorists, are nonsense by the middle ages and i am totally opposed to this approach.
if we can receive more, we will receive it, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not as they deal with our hungarian neighbours, cking and with the seriousness.
" that's what i don't agree with, " the head of the romanian executive said at a press conference in targu-jiu.
also on tuesday, peter szijjarto announced that the government in budapest decided to start preparations on the ground to extend the fence to the romanian border is building on the border with serbia, to deal with any change in the route used by migrants.
later, prime minister victor ponta said hungary's decision to raise a border fence not solve anything of the refugee problem and " takes hungary out of europe. "
ec link between osama bin laden to collapse of mecca butarght
saudi authorities have announced that the saudi giant binladin group, belonging to osama bin laden's family, is " partly responsible " for the collapse of a cranes friday on the great mosque in mecca, which resulted left 107 people dead.
according to an investigative committee, the company has not " comply with the safety rules, " the saudi news agency (spa), the bbc reported.
company directors have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation is completed in the case.
the firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
the construction firm is owned by the family of former al-qaida terrorist network leader osama bin laden.
the company, founded by osama bin laden's father 80 years ago and is currently headed by the brother of former terrorist leader bakr.
binladen group has been working on for 4 years to expand large mosques so that it can host several pilgrims.
the accident occurred during a storm late friday, when a butcher, probably unbalanced by strong shelves of wind, collapsed on the eastern part of the roof of the great mosque in mecca.
as a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
how haghagthe mouth closed to challenges
considered by romania's largest footballer in history, gica hagi was labelled, after he withdrew from his work, as a weak coach who cannot be able to perform in the new position as well.
after unfortunate experiences with the national team, steaua or galatasaray, hagi took over a aching role a year ago in the constant future, a team he owns.
fixed a year after assuming the team, the king demonstrated that he is capable of turning a team struggling king to save from downgrading to a top one.
so, a year later, the future registered, with hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 misery and 11 defeats.
the balance sheet is one of a top team, con european cups.
things took an even better turn for the future this season, as the team reached second in the 1st league, 19 points, one less than astra leader giurgiu.
the future also has the best attack in the 1 league, with 20 goals (equpar with astra), more than double than star.
on the other hand, even though he brought several experienced players to the team, hagi has continued the policy of promoting young people, and names have appeared in the start team such as ianis hagi or hodorogea.
the club's policy made the future a team to watch for teams from abroad, so hagi sold 1.5m euros this summer -- ianis hagi (fiorentina - 1m euros) and alexandru mitrita (bari - 500m euros).
together with the star, the future is the only profitable team in the 1st league, according to trade register data.
in the refugee crisis, romania has so far played as a small country.
it is a legitimate strategy, but then cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
large countries come up with solutions for the entire eu, says says cristian ghinea, a member of the executive college of the romanian european policy centre.
in an interview with ziare.com, cristian ghinea showed that europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and purely police means will not work in this crisis:' perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with these these people come'.
but there are masthat have started and we cannot turn history back.
migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as well as possible and adapt them to us.
in the opinion of cristian ghinea, we are at an extremely emotional time, when politicians feel the need to show their musccles.
once he has passed, europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the schengen area must be changed:' schengen is now like an animal created in another age and which was not adapted to the situation now'.
where are we in refugee crisis after this jha council which has, in fact, solved nothing?
it is clear that the ec president in agreement with donald tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
all the forecasts were saying that they would have had the necessary votes.
before the treaty of lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in the jha and any state could block any decision.
that is why things have been very little integrated into the area of justice and home affairs.
after lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the ec has the initiative, and the council approves it with the vote of 55% of states, that is 16, accounting represents 65% of the eu population.
the calculations said that the votes existed.
but they did not want to move forward.
as this is a sensitive issue, reactions of rejection have emerged in germany itself against chancellor merkel's policy of openness and did not want it to appear in many countries such as an'' eu sends us migrants to the'.
they have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because this wave obviously creates a huge problem for schengen governance and we will probably see great changes there in the coming period.
so binding quotas have not really been eliminated, but has the subject only been allowed to cool?
yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement by frontex in managing external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are on the external border of schengen to the responsibility of community agencies.
greece's border with turkey is also germany's border with turkey de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the limits to the old schengen system.
perhaps the dublin principle will be waived that migrants are the responsibility of the state in which they enter the first time, because it is unsustainable.
if greece walks, you cannot say indefinitely that it is greece's job.
the problem is common.
precisely because the problem is common, is a resolution possible without a precise, perhaps even binding, mechanism for sharing reception effort?
no one knows exactly how binding quotas will work if they are to reached.
because a problem remains: what do you doing with a man who does want to come to romania or portugal, but to sweden or germany?
i do not believe that european states will be on to take migrants up: you go to country x or the country of y.
some single filtering centres will likely be reached, greece or turkey, where asylum applications can processed.
work is being done on solutions like this.
but the problem has not a simple resolution.
there are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, are countries without any experience, like romania, where the problem problem migrants will increase the xenophobic trend.
the fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in turkey, lebanon in jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have only just begun to leave for europe.
an estimate says that only 10% went to leave, winter is hard to last the mediterranean, but we expect an perhaps even greater wave next year.
what do we doing with people?
my fostinews is that we will get used to this problem, we will no longer look at it so catastrophic from a media point of view.
spoke about countries with less or greater experience.
does it seems to you to be any place where it has really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-european culture?
i look at maghreb maghreb in france, at turks in germany, they are also ethnically enclaves.
i would not go to radical statements.
of course their integration is more difficult than in the case of other migration waves, but that does not mean that it is not integrated at all.
there remained an unintegrated part that creating major social problems in france, germany, in britain.
but purely police means will not work.
let us create fortress europe is illusory.
it must be humwed to integration mechanisms into european societies.
there were some mistakes here.
we need to be more demanding.
let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take values, to stop remain on one foot in europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family, including through marriages of convenience.
however, the imminent issue of these people from the long-term problem of their integration must be separated.
if others have failed in long-term integration it it does not mean that we must look at them they they interfering in the mediterranean.
perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come with.
and if there is an intervention in syria, which i do not think, does not mean that the country will recover restored overnight and can take it back.
until solutions arise, we see the fortress fortress within europe.
borders have been closed, walls are lifted, border controls are reintroduced into the schengen area.
is the european project at risk?
the european project as such no, the schengen area as built, yes.
it was built quite minimal minimal and and arrangthe rules, so pressure was too high on countries where they put their foot for the first time these migrants.
that is to say, we ating freely around there, but everyone is with its problems.
in the face of such a wave, cannot cannot be case, because some countries are not coping.
when there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long term much is not change.
after attacks attacks in france we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the eu than we had last year.
it is a wave of public emotion that is installed in both senses.
and it is so unstable from week week that you cannot make decisions on the basis of it.
we have a lot of talking, many rebellion statements statements politicians politicians at home under pressure to be virili.
and then you have the dramatic case of the inecned child in turkey and public opinion is exating.
after passing public emotion, we will return to the reasons why we have created this area, this freedom of movement, which is not only for people, but also for goods.
this is the real european european market.
and i do not think that europeans will give up this principle of liberty of movement.
there will be other rules is something else.
schengen is now like an animal created in another age and which was not adapted to the current situation.
romania how has it in this crisis so far?
as a small country, which believes that, if it draws sogging in the eye and ears its ears, the subject is disappearing.
in the face of the reality of of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it is not your problem as a small country.
that is what we have done, it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
you are not, not play at high country level.
large countries come up with solutions for the whole of the eu, good or bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
as poland has done.
on the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the romanians' appetite for schengen will fall greatly.
president iohannis says it is perhaps good that we have not already entered.
we are therefore moving from air of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
there is, of course, a risk whether romania and bulgaria enter schengen that migrants see us as an alternative route.
this does not mean that it is a reason to stop entering schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
romania will be part of schengen, and schengen will exist, but transformed into the sense that external borders will become joint responsibility, there will be single rules for accepting migrants, single rules of deportation for those-not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
the ukrainian president said that after russia moved its attention to syria to ukraine no one died.
is there a link between the two phobreaks, a russian game?
russia behabewith frustrated power.
she believes being being great power means incurring the americans and europeans.
from this point of view, yes, there is a link.
without the assad regime's military and financial effort, the assad regime would probably have long collapsed.
and it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the islamic state.
no two years has been a fight between the assad regime and moderate secular and muslim militias, supported by gulf and western countries.
then the islamic state was erecup and now we no longer know whether we want the assad regime to fall.
russia was able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
it creates a outbreak of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
but you are great power only if you also have solutions.
playing at off-side is just a strategy to gain time.
perhaps putin expects bids to be made, press butrels to resolve the situation.
offers do not come because the world is not convinced that it can resolve in one way or another issues he also creates.
but i do not agree with the theories that say these people are driven by an invisible hand.
let us not see a little stronger than it is.
what buton will appear soon
millions of facebook users have become used to the " like " button, and now representatives of the social networking network are preparing another opposite other, " dislike. "
on tuesday, mark zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on his account that this button would be available soon, the new york times reported on blog.
zuckerberg made it clear that the " dislike " button would show a nuance of what feels a user rather than just an option.
however, his announcement raised the issue that facebook could become a less friendly place.
zuckerberg noted that he wants to avoid a time when someone posts an important event in life on his account and someone else will give " dislike. "
the users of the network, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long been asked to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
mark zuckerberg also said it is not very comfortable for people to give' like' to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or to an death of a family member.
" you may not feel comfortable to want that post, " the facebook representative pointed out.
the version of a new facebook button has not been well received by everyone.
" there is already enough hatred on facebook and social networking networks, " atiq haneef of afghanistan commented on the new york times facebook page, where the article on the subject was posted.
" i will give' dislike' the' dislike' button, " he added.
roger anderson, a microbiologist from atlanta, claimed there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on facebook.
debra aho williamson, social media analyst at emarketer, noted it is hard to imagine that only one button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
moreover, she says, the election campaign in america is approaching and the " dislike " button would create a complete disaster.
only 70 refugees enter hungary within 24 hours
hungary accepted only 70 migrants on tuesday, a handful of thousands who came en masse on its southern border with serbia, government adviser gyorgy bakondi announced.
hungary declared a state of emergency later in the day in two counties along serbia counties due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing and announcing that it would build a fence on its border with romania, the dpa recalls.
the move drew a sharp reaction from serbia.
just yesterday they said that they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
" as you see, this is totally different, " said serbian minister for refugees aleksandar vulin.
before imposing new immigration immigration, a record record 5,809 migrants entered hungary on sunday, police announced on monday.
more more than 170,000 immigrants from the middle east and africa entered hungary from serbia in 2015.
many avoid being registered and trying to reach the west, especially germany.
the " new " county council headquarters stands its typical.
builders in insolvency
the massive investments made here in recent years to move the institution are to conthemselves down because they have been stopped several times.
two important builders who worked here went insolvency during the work.
the headquarters of the county council headquarters vasile alecsandri will end up giving down alone.
a year and a half after work on strengthening and re-functioning of the building should have been completed, work has achieved half.
one last stage in the era of the building was consumed recently, when the national council for dispute resolution (cnsc) rejected rejected complaint complaint with firm firm which wanted to take over the contract to realise the technical project for the work still to be carried out.
the initial project was drafted by impex romcatel.
following the builder's insolvency entry and disruption of the work, negotiation procedures are under way the publication publication of announcement announcement with impex romcatel, with the company expected to update technical technical project and then a new tender for works held.
" but the negotiations were not finalised by a contract, with the cj assessing that the proposed form would have put the institution at a disadvantage, " summed up razvan timofciuc, represented public relations within the cj.
the cj's decision to suspend direct negotiations was attacked in court by impex romcatel.
the extraordinary court sent its complaint to the cnsc, which rejected it as a belar.
this does not mean, however, that the cj can start seeking another project.
impex romcatel has the opportunity to attack the cnsc decision at the appeals court, only after a final ruling, it could it consider finding another project.
thus, work on strengthen the building could resume at early next year.
our intention is to restart work as soon as possible.
in principle, rebuilding the technical project should not take a long time, but we must reach into a contract.
" we are waiting to see whether or not the cnsc decision will be attacked, " timofciuc said.
work on strengthening the former headquarters of the police quaaestan began in 2011.
a first works contract was terminated in april 2012 after work of 4.5 million lei were carried out.
the tender resumed, with the contract against moldovconstruct sa.
the firm, however, went insolvency, and the contract terminated after 1.5 million lei were made.
work has so far been carried out about 50%.
initially, consolidation work, functionalisation and mansardare of the building had been evaluated at 7.7 million lei.
" no, i say everything! " -- a statement that could criminalise the former cadastre head.
one of the employees involved in the scandalous file at the cadastre office signed an agreement to recognise the facts, against prison by delay.
his statements will most likely criminalise the other indictees, led by former head narciza nedelcu.
an adviser at the cadastre office and real estate advertising advertising (cmo), iasi accused by the dna in a corruption corruption recognised its fap.
an agreement on recognition of the facts signed by dumitru dascalu was registered yesterday at the iasi tribunal, with judges judges setting a solution in the case on 29 september.
dumitru daniel dascalu was accused with false sely intellectual in continued form and agreed to execute two years from chişinău şinău, as well as community work.
as for the facts imputated, dascalu, prosecutors made not say that they, as adviser to the cadastre office, along with other colleagues, " drew up in forsely in several minutes of acceptance,, pri from contracts for service services in previous eiwn by o.c.p.i. neneed with managers of managers firms sc gauss srl, sc group srsreuros.
last days, former office head narciza nedelcu, but also other former or current cmo employees were tried on the dossier, with charges of services to the firms mentioned, although work has not been done.

without wishing, they have hit with the erroneous information the dreadful information, by the feeling of heapt controllers and, bonus, by a fine' like so called the law'.
husbands arrived in iasi a few days ago, stayed in in a centst hotel and called for tourist leaflets.

but two days ago in in popolis, they wanted to reach palas mall.
as it was no ticket es at the station near copou park, they were based on the printed information: that they could take a ticket via sms.

confident horrenly confident, they climbed on a bus and tried to send sms after the dreadful instructions.
unfortunately for them, a team of ratp controllers has arisen.
they said there has not been the the service for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
where to know what was written from the local media, with i coming a evening before visiting the city?
i spoke to the controllers, i explained their situation, they said they did not care, that is not their job.
the attitude has been very defiant.
they said that all they can do is swey one fine instead of 2 (me and wife).
" i paid, i did not want to shout my day of visiting standing at the gendarmerie and making statements there! " ovidiu counts.
in conclusion, the family was amended because of erroneous information and dreadful information and controllers who " applied the law in blood. "
that is not right, and i have made a complaint to ratp iasi to recover my money.
it is not a question of money, there is not excessive, but the point is that i felt deceived.
ghinion for rapists in vaslui.
accident accident, remain under preventive arrest
the trial of seven rapists from vaslui has, yesterday, moved to the iasi appeals court.
emerging magistrates tried the first trial at an non-public meeting in which the seven young accused of of cking an an 18 year year-old asked to be released.
before the actual start of the trial sitting, one of the outstanding judges whom the file had been distributed, viorel munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues at the court.
the magistrate activated by this summer of this year at the vaslui court, where he was president of the nale section, who, on april 9th admitted a challenge filed by four of the indictees, ordering them to be placed under house arrest.
currently, the dossier is being tried by a complete that includes magistrates marmyththical and getsaming.
earlier, in the file he formulated a abstention and judge dan an ton on the grounds that his daughter was in a relationship with competition with one of the rapists' lawyers.
the two judges decided that vaslui rapists should remain under preventive arrest.
and helchds will remain imprisoned for at least another 30 days, when juby monitors discuss the possibility of them at large.
the trial-term trial ker will take place at the iasi appeals court on 6 october.
before reaching the iasi appeals court, the duba with which rapists from vaslui transported transported involved in an accident in the neighbourhood of pacwishes, with the car entering iasi on the belt.
autoutilitara iveco with whom the seven rapists were transported hit a volks wagen car that walaway from the dela dela performsing, and the driver tried to return to the left.
duba circulates from the end to pacwishes.
the car entered iasi here because prison administration employees preferred the route from vaslui to iasi to the stables, then on the bypass road.
they thus shortened the way a few kilometres.
immediately after the impact, the escorescort called called for another transport to take over detainees.
shortly, a car was sent at the crash site from the iasi maximum safety penitentiary, who took over the seven detainees and transported them to the appeals court.
the accident accident none of the arrested were injured.
to transfer them to the other duba, security guards surrounded the back part of the maand s, and arrests came to speed two two each.
" the incident was not reported to the police, because drivers drivers of do ua cars understood themselves amicably about the damage to be paid, " said chief commissioner madalin taranu of the ipj.
the great migration
romania is neither nor will will it ready for what to come.
but europe?
i say it from the outset, clearly and clear: the 77,000 refugees they should and must naturnaturcitizenship to romania represent, in itself, an insignificant but huge number compared to the romanian state's ability to manage such a project.
for romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by bucharest, in amount of around 1 500 soul, far far beyond our good intentions of solidarity with the european union expressed in recent months.
certainly, if those migrants really accept establishing themselves in our locations, the chances of integrating them quickly into romanian society are extraordinarily small.
i am convinced that they will be the first to lose patience.
parazed by mobsters and paralysed by a venal political class, the romanian state is proving mired in all areas.
the failure to integrate the gypsies is just one trivial example.
in addition, governments of any colour have not been able to absorb european funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, to ensure decent healthcare, raise the street misery, create paid ably honourably or keep their own young generation at home.
why would refugees be established in another country from which they are running away?
but what causes great miris particularly the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt with.
we first come on the rebellion facism of the strong states of the eu, which show the utmost generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
then there comes the fririly hypocrisy of romanians who, although they have millions of scattered relatives around the world, do not yet accept the other - of another language, of another religion, another blood.
perhaps for fear of stealing his carebe be a national being.
ultimately, there is also hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for departure, do not accept another destination for exodus than germany or northern countries.
however, not all refugees are syrian, and in pakistan there is no war.
also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is being considered can only be derailed.
the causes must be eliminated, some argue and, by not strictly on the book of political correctness, they call for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
but there is peace in romania and it even, from time to time, some foreign capital into the national economy -- but this does not prevent tens of thousands of romanians from leaving their country every year.
why are they leaving?
in this crisis, the european union has been revealed to us that hasty, torn torn and outdated construction of the situation.
we deplore the fact that romania is unable to invent a country project, but here the eu does not have any future future plan either.
and improvisation and threats are helping nothing.
what is the eu still using, then, if the only advantage romanians romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be called into question due to waves of refugees crossing borders as cheese?
at one point, the war in syria will end.
not the crisis of migrants, however,.
in the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc., will push millions of desperate migrants, from asia, and particularly from africa, towards a better life.
with such politicians, romania is not, nor will it be ready for what to come.

two tomo tomhave swallowed somatives.
they taken to hospital
two 9-year-old children, or 11 from tomesti, brothers, have swallowed up several azepam pills.
they found tls at the home and took them out of curiosity.
their mother was in treatment and medicines were not hidden.
children were urgently taken to the " saint maria " hospital in iasi.
they are in stable condition, as doctors say.
exclusively: a meeting that breaks your heart.
20 years received a courageous but: biological parents
lost in hospital in unclear conditions, in the denial of the 1990s, when it had only two months of life, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in italy, in the same years as adoption was regulated vague, a young woman is woman, now a blonand beautiful girl, has met the day before yesterday in iasi with biological parents in a village.
the crina will fulfill 20 years these days, and her adoptive parents in palermo thought of giving their daughter loed a stunning and courageous gift: a visit to romania, to iasi, to know his unclear past.
the " iasi newspaper, " which witnessed efforts to search for the home family after several very vague clues, witnessed these meetings, basically basically break your heart.
according to reporters, emotions at the moment, statements by those involved, their reactions are downright moving and overwhelming.
the story of the drc begins 20 years ago in the rusty town, when it was only two months months.
then, due to a health problem, girl had to be admitted to hospital to the city.
there were disagreements at home between parents, and my mother had to go on the home.
he decided to keep in and and send me from home.
he stopped the face, and since then we have known known anything.
" when i learned he was in hospital, it was too late, " indurata alina, a biological mother of the girl remembers.
the crina was admitted with her grandmother to pascani city hospital, and also then the girl's father, costica balcan, left for work in the town of alexandria, teleorman county.
their lives had to break permanently.
they't find crina at hospital
after the internship, the drc's father left for work at home, and returned six months later.
meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the iasi hospital, and the father, when he returned, didn not find it.
i think they had taken almost nine months since he was in hospital.
" she thought she she was being abandoned, " tells an grandfamily daughter.
due to financial problems, the grandmother was unable to come up with crina in iasi, and the girl remained doctors' care.
because no one has more interested in the fate of the child throughout the time, she was taken over by the directorate-general for social assistance and protection of the iasi child, who then then her to care for the placement centre in bucium.
there were years of abandonment and adoption were liily regulated to romania's today.
at the bucium centre, it was found by italy's salvadore and his wife, a couple in palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
they fell in love on the spot of blonduta crina, and some time she had to permanently move with them to italy.
the small had already done nearly two years while adoption formalities have taken.
when we saw the crina, we felt it was before us.
" as if my wife gave him his life, " tells us smiling salvadore, the foster father, while arriving in the palace of his vain hand of the girl.
in the country, drc's parents alina and costica continued the searches separately, each they could.
the father asked authorities in the rugsty, but received no response where his child could be.
police then told them that they may be dead, but in iasi parents parents learned what really happened to them.
when i sought her here, they told me to the court that he was going to italy to palermo.
and the conditions to look for it had longer had.
we asked to god to be good.
i thought about it in all the years that have passed, but there were no possibilities to harm, to find it.
" it is hard, " ttears tfully tells us in the navy's biological mother.
but, even though the years have passed, the rusty parents were not forgotten.
in italy, salvadore and the wife explained to the girl he comes from and that her past connects it with romania.
i was small when i learned.
i think we was five or six years old.
i reacted as a copy, i was curious.
" i wanted to know my parents in romania, " i confess delighted crina.
and her dream was to become a reality.
in march of this year, chief commissioner romica ichim, director of the regional centre for prevention, evaluation and anti-drug advisiasi, was contacted by an knowledge from italy, explaining explained him salvadore's desire to find the drc's biological family.
and the searches started only from a name.
after our request from our partners in italy, we began the first first steps.
we received only one name, balcan costica, then locality, rugsty.
shortly i had a job with the city hall there, and i could ask whether there was the name received by quality.
then they gave me some indications, only that the person found was not the person one wanted.
" it took about a month in the end to find the biological father of the girl, " chief commissioner romica ichim explains us.
in all, more than three months have taken authorities to find the coastal and alina, especially as everyone was resident in another village.
we began work somewhere in march, and in june-july we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
" then we established a first meeting would take place in september, " romica ichim added.
at the weekend that passed, alina and costica saw their faces lost at iasi iasi hospital branches 20 years ago.
the father, moved, has hardly been able to his tears and his hands have awshed them forever.
it is only changing a few words with those around us.
a week before the meeting, it could not even sleep.
it was all emotional, wake passing.
" to see your child after so many years, it is something, " tells us an granddaughter, also also the rugsty coastal ans.
drc meeting with mother, biological brother
in talks with him, who is expected to study at a well-rated university in italy, costica balcan told him, among other things, that if he once wants to return to him in the village, to come quily: he can give him some sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and incite a household.
my mother is also emotional, complains, and she hardly believes this can happen to her.
i am very moved.
i did not think this could happen.
i saw such cases on television, i had thought these years, i had hoped, but i did not think that could be the case.
these are very emotion.
if he could forgive me.
i hope that we will visit in the future.
" i hope we can keep a touch, " tells us with big tears on obji alina, the mother of the drc, while keeping a servitude closely in his hands.
he conceals his tears ears in him, fortunately, because he will soon see ahead with them after so so long.
on the other hand, the crina, which will beg in just a few days' time this month, 20 years, is trying to reassure himself like an emotional child.
he does not know what to expect, but has sketout a vague idea of her biological parents.
he think they are young, but now before the meeting they am trying trying to give their thoughts, because it has lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
my parents are two mothers and two fathers.
but it is ultimately my parents who have grown up me.
it will be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
" i hope to have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say, " crina confess.
first family meeting in iasi
in the unification market, under the sky ies beginning of the autumn, the rugsty family again unites its destiny with front of them in palermo.
the crina is 20 years ago, ends high school, according on the italian school model, but can begin a new chapter with alina and costica, its biological parents.
borders are no longer separated borders or countries, but only one barrier: language.
over which, with the help of an translator, an italian local owner at the centre of the hell, easily passed.
those who managed to make this meeting possible say that this is the first event of its kind, and that in future, if the opportunity arises again, they will do.
it is the first event of its kind, by such an emotional charge, and i am pleased to be a success.
we at the centre have various activities, and we are often associated as an institution dealing only with consumer people, people dependent on drugs.
but we are trying to restore society something good back.
" if i have asked asked for such an food food, i will do so with great dear, " says smilsmiling romica ichim, director of the regional centre for prevention, iasi anti-drug and counselling.
behind it, the balcan family, with the crina in the middle, distance themselves themselves.
i am understandable: they have a lot to tell each other.
a ceasefire with weapons on the leg yesterday at the psd.
everyone draws their soul
camps in the psd's extraordinary branch ended a gunceasefire on the leg.
after successive rounds of talks held from friday to sunday, the first and the most tense, psd leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
pressed by the party's executive president, liviu dragnea, to present a united position, the emerging social democrats will send him a whole list of potential candidates for party posts.
far from over, the internal war in the party seems to have taken only a break to allow combatants to drag their soul.
dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
it has sent a very simple and very current message at the current time: you are trying to find a solution not to jeopardise the party.
on 3 october, we have party elections.
all functions will be made available to those who want them.
" until then, we remain in the existing structure, " said acting mayor mihai chirica.
the two days of talks at the weekend led led to the conclusion that nothing certain was established.
in the october elections, fierce competition is expected to become president of the psd's county branch.
the brief list of possible candidates for the main post in the party's extraordinary branch includes state secretary maricel popa, senator florin constantinescu, senator sorin lazar, county adviser vasile catea and acting president of the county council, victorel lupu.
added to this, the mayor of como schitu is leading, mihai mihalache.
one consideration consideration is the candidacy of psd county advisers leader cristian stanciu should lupu stop joining the race, with party sources saying he is not interested in the post.
the only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of branch leader, mayor gheorghe nichita.
the list of candidates is open.
under status, including on election day applications can be submitted, and it would not surprise anyone if it happened.
" what is important is that we remain united, and we will stay after october, when we have a new executive office, a new permanent county office and all new leadership structures, " catea added.
until domestic elections are held, the leadership of the psd county county branch will be secured by victorel lupu, close close to nichita and stanciu.
lupu, however, is on leave until 29 september, with preparation for the elections virtually inby branch branch secretary, county adviser mihail popescu, who is in cold relations with the nichita camp.
contacted telephone, cristian stanciu has praised the talks in recent days as leading to " a partial consensus. "
there is broad willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
a partial consensus has been reached to support a unitary team to deal with the county.
" but on the other hand, there are several variants regarding intentions concerning candidacy for the iasi psd presidency, with the list remaining open, " stanciu commented.
emerging judge refuses file of vaslui rapists on the grounds of competition
the seven young people in vaslui county convicted of rape today arrive to the iasi appeals court.
vasluians sentenced to sentences ranging between five years to eight months and eight years, and four months will today present their arguments about their at large, after the court of substance, vaslui judge, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentencing.
the file was registered at the appeals court late last week, with magistrate dan anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
anton cited that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer bogdan luca, is the competition of his daughter, lawyer dana anton.
luca defends silviu ovidiu burada, who who received the highest sentence in this dossier.
as judges motivated judges
late last week, the magistrate at vaslui judge who convicted the seven young people motivated the sentence.
motivating, the judge talks about the defiant reaction of defendants, but also of those who supported them, pointing clear that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
" the court notes that after judicial control was placed to a preventive extent, restrictive restrictive of freedom but not deprivof freedom, under the impact of the attitude of defendants, their families and local supporters, was felt at local and national community level a strong sense of indignation that people accused of serious facts are being tried to a less restrictive extent, " said to motivating vassship judgment.
magistrates also dismantled the main defence of the seven indictees who during the trial cited the fact that the girl they raped would not be " the door to church. "
" the contracting court states that it lacks without relevance the moral quality of the injured person, which the defendants wanted to highlight through the apparatus they formulated, because the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext, " the motivation also states.
corbyn, brexit and future of europe
for economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades cannot continue to continue the same in the coming years.
until saturday, probably little world knew in romania who jeremy corbyn was.
even today, after he became the new leader of the uk labour party, many are wondering to what extent can affect our election of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
jeremy corbyn is the most radical clumtist leader of labour after war war.
marxist said, anti-monarchist (he once asked tony blair, then prime minister to take the royal family out of buckingam palace), a feroce anti-american, and an sympathiser of vladimir putin (he was otherwise regularly invited to comment on political developments by the television channel " russia today "), and hizbollah and hamas, to give up weapons.
for corbyn, who at the time considered the murder of osama bin laden a real tragedy, it is almost preferable to the united states.
along the model of all populist demagogues, corbyn, of course, has miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
things such as those he said and promised and tsipras in greece until he ched with the real world and economic ties.
the economic programme of the new labour leader provides, among other things, massive renationalisation and the printing of money as a solution to financing development and cover projects covering very generous social benefits.
of course, some might wonder why the solution with printing money is not unanimously adopted around the globe, we would then have a overall global prosperity! but who would prevent itself from such details.
of course, we can tax blood on bankers, become some kind of service enemies of the left, but as as it has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in ecuador or venezuela, but also in france at the beginning of mitterand and hollande's mandates.
the additional sums are quickly swallowed up by generous, uncover promises made by populist demagogues.
as margaret thatcher was well pointed out, " the problem of socialism is that at some point, others' money ends'.
few give real chances to jeremy corbyn will ever reach prime minister.
in the early 1980s, another radical left-wing leader, michael foot, who was not as extremely convincing anyway as the fresh party leader, failed lamentably in the elections.
and then there is still a workers' class in britain, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
and trade unions were sensitive more influential than they were now.
at a time of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant throughout the labour force and extensive-automations have made a massive need for highly qualified labour power in industry, corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
however, even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
in its latest financial times believes the election of corbyn increases the chances of brexx, namely britain britain leaving the eu.
the new labour leader has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the union.
in the eyes of brussels' radical left is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed austerity on the poor.
when you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that is rocking the foundations of the eu reaches an explosive mix.
and not just for britain.
but if the british decide following the referendum, which would take place by 2017, leave the union the loss of symbolic capital for the entire european project and the deep lines created within it by the euro crisis, and now that refugees refugees, north and south, between east and west,, leave room for scenarios in the most worrying.
all the more so because for a whole series of member states, london was an counterbalance on the franco-german axis (in which berlin is increasingly becoming the dominant actor) anyway.
true, the british business, the city, are strong lawyers of the country's remaining in the eu.
but, today's europe is no longer in the past.
there are many resentment, which are growing in intensity in the very as these weeks.
the problem is that brussels, i had a sample just recently in jean clude junker's speech, is increasingly tending to take major decisions over the head of the vast majority of member states in consultation with only a few european powers, mainly germany.
and this is at a time when electoral support for the anti-system, anti-immigration formthat are at the same time also eurosceptic is growing dramatically throughout the continent.
in other words, the emotional negative with charged climate has reached levels higher than ever in the past.
hence the conclusion drawn by the financial times draws when assessing gap's chances.
the pro-eu option is based on a cold calculation leaving from the national interest.
if voters make the bral decision, then britain will remain in the eu.
but corbyn's victory reminds us the power of emotion in current politics.
however, eastern europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
especially if, as expected, we see greater integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and on the outskirts of interest and that of the decision-making process in europe.
corbyn, tsipras and syriza in greece, the podemos in spain, even bernie sanders in the united states feed feed their populist rhetoric from frustrations in odary societies.
for economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades, the generous social benefits can no longer continue the same in the coming years.
under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the euro area - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that have only taken into account integrationist political ambitions, not the capacity and availability of the peoples and governments of europe to respond to such challenges, turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the eu will increase in intensity and may major affect romania's situation.
and it is difficult to exclude something in terms of possible scenarios.
the question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
constantin brancusi, the god taran.
rockefeller: " how can i help?'
brancusi:' takes and mature the workshop!'
the great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to get famous famous to hear about it around the world.
behind his famous hiding, however, something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for life success.
that also has a name.
it is called' circumvent'.
what write about constantin brancusi?
what remains to be said, in fact?
his figure appeared on notes.
and recently, a known bank in romania has hired an actor playing him in a advertising clip.
cheese produces and deliver money nearly 60 years after it is no longer with us.
in romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards bearing his name.
in fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
and when it emerges out with odrasla, i hear the following instructions:' we go to the park, cheese cheese'.
the country is sadpered by its statues.
there are few romanian figures whose works are known by so world, from children, to the elderly.
brancusi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
the communists also also unable to extirate from romania's memory and culture.
his quotations are today raising the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of like as and share.
and then, again, what would still be to say, to write about this man?
viewed from a lot of books and articles trying to re-constitute its destiny, cheese's's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
you know, there are those people who tell you that, if you did not have the good fortune to give up in any large city and a family as well as possible, your chances of success in life are almost null.
brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
and perhaps it would be a key here.
perhaps the forthcoming text should start from this.
with a sentence, however detestable they are.
look at your success stories, which are delivered to you daily in the newspapers and on television.
look carefully at the figure of this man.
do you want to know how he has succeeded alive, how, today, he has heard a whole world of him?
it is simple.
he has worked all life to be someone.
that is what he did.
constantin brancusi born on february 19th 1876 in hobita, a small joint village in fish sans, gorj county, at carpathian foot.
he is the fifth child of maria and radu nicolae brancusi.
although he came from a well-off easant family, cheese si takes a modest life, but one of which he had to reap the benchmarks that will guide his late artistic vision.
recalling childhood and places where he grew up, the artist had to confess at a meeting with petre tutea, in paris in 1933:' back then life was beautiful and harmonious'.
for millennia, people were taken a patriarchal life, happy.
everything was all med ly from one seasons to another.
and do you know why things have changed?
the civilisation of the great city has reached us.
brancusi's childhood, however, was far from a idillic one.
one of the moments in these first years of life is highly revealing for the combination of purity and violence that characterised its future of sculptor or years in his home town.
the moment is reproduced in the work " cheese. a biography, " written by alexandru buican.
in 1879, constantin brancusi was 3 years old.
in the autumn of that year, when tuica was done " at casan, " watching those who samaste the liquidid to see if the process takes conducted properly, cheese and catch a moment of general attention.
it fills its bail of films with tuica and drink on shamoppressed.
it falls in almost instantaneaneep.
the first people see a few minutes later.
the mother panic, then in hysteria, believing the son died him.
in the evening, when the father, radu, returns from alive accompanied by grerels, he sees from away the desperate signs of those who very much await him at his mouth.
the party immediately turn into jale.
the father is already thinking of burial.
however, someone finds it is good to call baba brandusa, dodes and cheese servvers.
cheese verifies children's respirath, then puts it under the cal's balega of horse, gathered from the eve.
the child raised hard.
the world applauds.
while the boy is left to sleep his beer, of joy, the party with grerels continues even more force.
the next day, father and son meet with livada.
radu brancusi puts constantin to pick together some nuances and bring them.
the father puts his child with his head down and, with the nueuds brought by the boy, bebeats him to remember.
and, while he feels the ststth of bblows, small cheese has the revelation that the world can also be seen from another perspective and that the things around can arise overpled.
in particular the the sun position, different different from the well-known one makes makes him wonder, as he had to recognise in old age, if not the astre itself participates in his turmoil.
has it been the sun as disturbed as his father about what happened to him?
currently, the city is not working
an mp calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
independent deputy viorel blajut called on the psd and the pnl to stop internal battles and refocus their agenda to the electorate.
what we are now seeing on our political scene is a great divide, and that.
we have seen nothing of the usl projects in 2012 that continue.
neither the highway nor a regional emergency hospital only see how politicians dispute their possible locations according to real estate interests.
let us leave a little political aside, gather and speak.
at present, the city is not working.
" if you are busy with internal war, you don't have time for those who elected you, " blajut said.
he assessed that the current political class had disappointed emerging voters, resulting in a very low presence in the upcoming local elections, around 30 30 cent figure, representing representing the parties' faithful voters.
the deputy also believes voters will also move to traditional parties, expressing reservations for new political initiatives, such as the " for iasi " party that will be launched today.
local parties have a very little chance and will only break from the electorate of the right, not that of the psd.
such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually quite right.
" the right is further farking, which is not good for anyone, nor for the psd, " blajut said.
he made it clear that he is not interested in an candidacy for the upcoming local elections, denying rumours of his intention to join the mayoral race.
i also said that i do not want to run for any local office.
i am also considering whether to continue as a member in the next term of office as well.
i tried to call for unity for iasi and the cholo discussions, with other parliamentarians, and i was accused of wanting to make my image.
i do not want, but we cannot go on like this.
" if people voted for us, it does not mean they are fools to vote for us if they see nothing, " said blajut, who assessed that the main reason the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the alps.
a colleague from tatarasi said he does not reach his money and had to go by bus.
let us not be hypocritical.
there is no little money.
sometimes i am ashamed to raise the money from cake.
at the end of the term of office, i will report a report with everything i have spent, apart from cabinet' salaries and its maintenance.
i happened to raise in a month's time 30,000 lei, with all transport deposaccounts, accommodation and others.
" to tell an mp that he does not end up his money is clean hypocrisy, " blajut ended.
