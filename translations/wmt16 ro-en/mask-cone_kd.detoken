un chief says no military solutions in syria
secretary-general ban ki-moon says his response to russia's military support for syria is that " there is no military solution " to the conflict that has been going on for nearly five years, and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
the un chief again urged all parties, including the divided un security council to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
at a conference wednesday, ban said plans to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent countries present in the council -- the us, russia, china, england and france -- on the ministerial session of the general assembly to discuss syria.
ban voiced regret that divisions in the council and between the syrian people and regional powers " have made this situation unresolved. "
ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the syrian crisis.
8 polls showing donald trump stands
some tried to label him as a " flip-flop " politician.
others called him a joke.
and others are waiting for implosion.
but no matter how some republicans try to remove polls polls's donald trump, it has not worked (yet).
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that two figures donald trump leads and some are starting to seriously wonder what this means for the chances of appointing the real estate mogul.
of course, it is still premature.
none of this says trump will win the race for nominating republicans.
pundits shows that during the same period in 2011, rick perry's lead took place for herman cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
and the reasons why they would fight hard in the general elections are many.
but outside groups such as jeb bush's super cap and the economic conservative group club for growth admit trump's power and are starting to back it with money.
we are still presenting you some figures in recent polls suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just a passing passing:
figures indicating support for trump returned 180 degrees.
even before donald trump announced his candidacy in mid-june, a survey by the university of monmouth shows that only two out of 10 republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
until mid-july, the percentage climbed to 40%.
in early august, it was 52 per cent.
currently, six out of 10 republicans have a favourable view of donald donald trump.
about three out of 10 say they have a negative view.
these figures
a poll conducted last week by quinnipiac in iowowconcluded that 60% of the region's republicans have a favourable view of the trump.
two thirds of gop voters would be happy if trump won the race for nomination.
in a poll conducted last week by cnn / orc, 67% of republicans said they would be " enthusiastic " or " satisfied " if trump won the race for the nomination.
only two out of 10 say it would be " angry " if trump won the race for nomination.
only ben carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as trump (43% says he would be " enthusiastic " about 40% who declare the same about trump).
closest in terms of enthusiasm?
marco rubio, with only 21%.
on the other hand, 47% of republican voters say they would be " dissatisfied " or " angry " if jeb bush wins the nomination race.
most republicans do not see trump's temperament as a problem.
while donald trump has come under strong criticism for his insults and bombastic style, 52% of nationwide republican voters consider the real estate mogul the right temperature to be president, according to a poll by abc news / washington post on monday.
we find the same figures in the state of iowa, where 52% of republicans believe trump has the right personality to lead, according to a poll by quinnipiac last week.
however, 44% believe they does not have the personality to act effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say his temperature has no place at the white house, according to abc / post.
republican voters used to the idea.
when taking attitude of intellectuals, republican voters consider trump authentic.
according to a poll conducted by cnn / orc last week, the question of who has the best chance of winning the race for nominating gop, four out of 10 said the trump.
the situation has changed since the end of july, when four out of 10 were bet on jeb bush.
full information: in the past, gop voters have not read the future very well.
during the same period in the last elections, four out of 10 republicans chose rick perry in the nomination race, compared to only 28% for mitt romney.
but these figures show that the majority of gop voters consider trump's campaign plausible.
even though the republicans or to another candidate; trump still heads everyone.
some say the divided situation is likely to contribute to trump's victory, while support trump will split into more than a dozen candidates.
but a poll in early september by the university of monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of collaboration between trump and most other republican candidates, almost always trump will receive majority support.
trump is 13 points away from carly fiorina, 14 points from marco rubio, at 15 walker points at 19 points on jeb bush and, finally, 33 points each from paul, john kasich and chris christie.
it is almost with ted cruz.
the only candidate him?
ben carson would defeat the businessman 19 points in a one-to one hypothetical confrontation.
most of donald trump's supporters say they have been decided.
a new poll conducted by cbs / nyt on tuesday shows that more than half of voters supporting trump say they are not changing their voting option.
obviously, much can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing its option.
however, trump's most important adversary is currently neurosurgeon ben carson, but it is twice as likely that voters who say they have decided to vote with trump.
six out of 10 republicans say they agree with trump on immigration.
since donald trump appointed immigrants from mexico " rapists " in his opening speech opening his campaign two months ago, immigration was the central topic in the campaign for 2016.
some are concerned that trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between important hispanici voters and the republican party and reanding efforts.
but according to the poll conducted by abc / post on monday, six out of 10 republicans say they agree with trump on immigration.
so it seems that as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, so will doland trump.
frustration with the authorities is reaching new culurs.
donald trump and ben carson are now supported by nearly half of republican voters, largely because of their outsident status.
according to a poll by abc / post on monday, six out of 10 republicans say they prefer a outsider to the expense of someone with government experience.
people are also with washington.
a poll two weeks ago in iowa by often moines oso/ bloomberg shows that three out of four iowa republicans are frustrated by the performance of the republican congress with 54% saying they were " dissatisfied " and 21% " nervous to sleme. "
jeremy corbyn makes debut first ministry's questions
since his election, the start of corbyn in pmqs has long awaited.
the new labour party leader jeremy corbyn will make his debut at the prime ministry's questions later, facing david cameron for the first time.
mr corbyn will ask the first of six questions he is entitled shortly after noon; his performance will probably be closely examined by the media and labour parliamentarians.
in weekly weekly ances, he called for " less theatre and more facts. "
he also said he can give up some participation and succumb over to his colleagues.
the confrontation will be mr corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after appointing a " phantom cabinet " and his speech at the annual tuc congress on tuesday.
meanwhile, the decision by the leader of the labour party to remain silent at the news of the national anthem at a service tuesday marking the 75th anniversary of the battle of england drew criticism from conservative mps and made the headlines.
corbyn's decision not to sing national anthem draws attention
a spokesman for mr corbyn said that he' respectfully silent' and recognised the' heroism of british air forces in the battle of england'.
but a member of mr corbyn's ghost cabinet, owen smith, told the bbc two's newsnight that he would have recommended that the labour leader to play the national anthem " regardless of " his belief that monarchy should be abolished.
around a dozen fanantom cabinet ministers refused to be part of mr corbyn's leading team, arguing through differences of opinion on the economy, defence, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported it as leader.
bbc political correspondent robin brant says policy differences " cumulate " in the labour party following mr corbyn's appointment to his position towards the eu and the benefit limit.
mr corbyn said at the tuc conference that the labour party would bring about changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
a few hours later, mr smith, minister for labour and pensions, stated that the party' is very clear' in exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the' head' level from 26.000 lira to 23.000.
mr corbyn will be the fifth labour leader facing david cameron at the gallery in the last decade since taking over the conservative party.
the labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas' from external sources' for questions to mr cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
parliament member islington north said pmqs involves too high a level of confrontation and would refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging instead to focus instead on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
mr corbyn said that angela eagle, the finance minister, will hold his place in pmqs when he cannot attend - for example when mr cameron moves abroad.
he also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying he addressed chamber of deputies president john bercow to discuss the issue.
when he took office in 2005, mr cameron stated that he wanted to give up the' punch and judy' political style often associated with pmqs, but acknowledged a few years later that he had failed to do so.
since the first transmission in 1990, pmqs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's rationale, way he leads the chamber of deputies and its position among fellow critics say it has become a caricature and needs deep reform.
'framework on the job on': homeless young people receive photography courses

but a group of people who lived on the streets during childhood found a way to learn a job and earn a living.

jd sports head says higher salaries could harm enlargement enlargement
jd sports president peter cowgill says an increase in the minimum wage in britain could mean " greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers. "
but purchasing power is unlikely to exceed higher labour costs within the firm, he says.
costs could have an impact on jd sports's enlargement plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
thanasi kokkinakis backed by tennis australia president steve steve egry
thanasi kokinakis would deserve praise than criticised for his behaviour.
thanasi kokkinakis has been the collateral victim in the " storm " around his friend nick kyrgios, and his behaviour deserves words of praise rather than criticism in the opinion of tennis australia president steve egry.
kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called " special ks, " has been unplantly dragged into the spotlight by the scandalous derapathy kyrgios had towards stan wawrinka to the montreal masters tournament.
in a heavy qualification match shortly after, in five years, the ground, the seat referee had to intervene twice to divide kokkinakis and his opponent ryan harrison, after which harharrison said, " " wawrinka should have put kyrgios on the ground, and i should have put him on the ground. "
although last seen making a dust rocket after having muscular cre and missed a possible us open tournament, angered richard gasquet, kokkinakis was strongly defended by uney.
the teenager is currently in glasgow, where he battles sam groth for second individual place, after bernard tomic in the davis cup semifinal against england.
" one thing i feel strong is that, in my opinion, thanasi has been attracted a little into conflict, " egry said.
the truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused crampe in the us, but he is not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself, and i know thanasi well enough to know that he would not be proud of it.
but to be serious, it has strained extremely well in fairly provocative situations in us with harrison and so on, and i think it deserves a lot of confidence.
it has an extraordinary team, it has a great family and i think it has been unfairly treated.
he is a very mature 19-year-old man, works hard and integrated into the team, had no conflict with the other players, he is very respected in the west, he trains hard, he is in an excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young man, and i think he deserves to be tried solely on the basis of his qualities and defects.
egry also backed the decision not to consider kyrgios for the important retraining match, which begins friday, and described the " joint decision " as the most suitable for all, but supported the long-term long-term canberra's return to the team.
" first, we want the team to focus fully on the stakes match and not to think at all at all about the controversy around [kyrgios], " egry said.
and i think nick moved up very quickly, as people like federer and murray said, he maturures under the public eyes and made some terrible mistakes and deserves to criticism, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his facts and i think he needs a time when he is not at the centre of attention so that he can reflect, team and for him.
2016 elections: hillary clinton's advantage over bernie sanders shrunby half in national polls
former secretary of state hillary clinton still has a two-lead in the democratic race for national candidacy, but senator bernie sanders gaining ground.
clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
vice president joe biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is backed by 15% of democratic voters.
at least five months before the start of the primary elections, the majority of democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
but clinton's supporters are stronger in their election than supporters of other candidates.
compared to the cbs news conducted last month, clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while sanders won several per cent.
clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has shrunk.
male support has been reduced considerably and sanders is only 5 points away.
clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 evaporated and now on a par with sanders.
however, clinton is still at the advantage among elderly voters.
last month, clinton stands before sanders, with two figures, among liberals, but sanders now has a slight 5-point advantage in this group.
about half of democratic voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
a quarter would support it and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
six per cent would not support it.
perhaps unsinging, clinton's current supporters likely to be enthusiastic about her election is high.
opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support clinton -- only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
while 48% of democratic voters say they would enthusiastically back clinton, the number of republican voters who say the same about first-ranked donald trump (35%) is lower.
when clinton's supporters are asked an open question as why she would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has adequate experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this post (10%).
clinton's supporters also note her association with bill clinton (9%).
agreement is also on these issues and eligibility.
with the vice-president considering a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him in the race -- although a third believe they should not run.
when the question of the second option for the party representative, democratic voters majority call biden.
among clinton's supporters, more than half say biden would be the second option, well ahead of sanders.
if biden decides not to run for the democratic party race, hillary clinton's advantage over sanders increases from 20 points with biden in the race to 30 points if he is not running.
55% of democratic voters consider clinton the best likely candidate of winning the general elections; but the figures dropped from 78% last month.
biden is second away, but the percentage that he is most eligible has increased.
however, when asked what is most important for an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
as last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters unacceptable as party representative in the presidential race.
democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well in terms of several key characteristics compared to their party's primary voters.
the majority of voters see clinton, sanders and biden and reliable and with solid leaders.
biden is best seen of all three in terms of integrity, while clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not think h. clinton is integrated and reliable, twice as many as those who say it about sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion on it.
democratic voters also generally believe that the three, clinton, sanders and biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
on all issues, about a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion sanders.
as questions persist about the use of a personal email address and a server by hillary clinton when she served as secretary of state, the majority of democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject and say she did not affect their overall opinion on the candidate.
but things are different among the us public.
half of the americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
public opinion was divided in march on the issue, shortly after the issue came to light.
most americans say the email controversy has not affected their overall view on clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion.
mainly the republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their view on clinton on the negative sense.
although democratic voters consider clinton integrate and reliable, this continues to raise problems among voters in general: only 32% consider it integrate and reliable, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in may.
62% of voters do not integrate and reliable.
at the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not regard trump integrre and reliable.
however, both clinton and trump have white leadership.
of the six candidates, biden, carson and bush first in terms of integrity.
the number of those who consider sanders integrru is higher than those who disagree, however, as with carson's case, many have no opinion on him.
the margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
five brotherhood members indicted for baruch faculty
nearly two years after a university student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the pocono mountains in pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
members of the pi delta psi therhood at new york-based baruch faculty brutally attacked chun " michael " deng during a initiation ritual in september 2013 and postponed taking him to hospital, helping to his death, according to police.
official sources say the victim was tied to the eye, was put behind a 140kg rupack pack full of sand and has been repeatedly bullied while trying to move towards a target on frozen land.
mr deng accused headaches before losing knowledge.
pi psi brotherhood members did not call the emergency number after he fashed and claim they would have waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.
but they found the time needed to change deng's clothes, look for its symptoms and contact andy meng, president of the national brotherhood, to ask his advice, police chief chris wagner said at a press conference.
" at this point, members have started hiding personal goods and practically put the good of the brotherhood before michael deng's good, " wagner said.
it could not be resursuscted and died the next morning.
according to an autopsy report, deng suffered repeated traumas on his head, trunknes and coapses.
" too many families were devastated by the brother' rituals since 1970 at least one student lost life every year because of the rituals, " douglas fierberg, lawyer for deng's family, said in a statement.
brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
monroe district's grand jury recommended that the top five members be charged with third-degree crime.
thirty-two other brobrotherhood, including mr meng, will also face charges for ultraj and complicity in the murder.
" we want to hold not only the people involved but, if there is an organisation that has authorised the brotherhood, officially or informally, also hold it to account, " wagner said at a press conference tuesday.
baruch faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representative.
that is what will happen when the federal reserve increases interest.
the interest rate will rise and bull market (growing market) will pomer, the profitability of bonds will increase and the economy will enter recession.
that is what we know.
what we do not know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
in the economy, history offers few indications of time.
after the first interest rate increase, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
the aggression of the federal reserve to raise interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets.
that is why officials from the us central bank have emphasised so strongly that investors should not focus on when they are starting to raise interest rates but on the trajectory of time needed for normalisation.
indeed, at stake are multiple variables.
but in the end, market players could see that all the turmoil of interest rate increase has been exaggerated.
" the first interest rate increase decided by the edf after the global financial crisis will be inevitably interpreted by some as a sign of the " cheap money, " julian jessop, chief economist at capital economics, said in a note to customers.
on the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of us interest rates to more normal but still small levels to constitute the earthquake shock that everyone seems to fear.
however, it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
we are still presenting how some sectors of the economy could react, building on historical trends:
given the situation that the market has faced in recent months, anticipation of an interest rate increase can volatile things for some time.
however, at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
" it seems there is a tendency that the profitability of capital will stagnate for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which perhaps again reflects deforestation in monetary policy, " deutsche bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after edf increases.
specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has increased sharply - by around 14% - moving towards increasing the interest rate, quite invariably over the 250 days after (average climation of 2.6%) and then returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on barron by chief strategist veen asset management.
deutsche said that the impact on actions tends to become more later in the cycle of raising interest rates, and benefits are starting to fall.
the recession is a reality of economic life, interest rates often contributes to it.
in the current situation, the edf is facing conditions that did not exist before and which could speed up a recession.
specifically, gross domestic product will move closer to its historic minimum point for an increase in the edf interest rate.
according to deutsche bank, out of 118 interest rate increases after 1950, only twice gdp was less than 4.5%.
even though, in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to edf atlanta.
increasing the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question " whether this time it is different, " deutsche said.
market players prepared the the year for an edf growth decision, with all eyes this week's meeting of the federal open market commission, which ends on thursday.
although many strategists and economists believe fomc could approve an interest rate increase at the meeting ,-term transactions indicate problikely of only 25%.
" in our post-1950 study, all cycles of raising interest rates so far have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with gdp eclipping the varieties before the recession very quickly after recovery begins, " the report said.
on the contrary, this has been a ododly slow recovery recovery after the worst recession in the period under consideration.
the current cycle is by far the longest expected by the edf since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months and has reached 74 months and continues.
fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase and the printing is somewhat similar to the dividends.
the main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of actions when the edf amends the policy.
in the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits are changing direction as soon as the first growth / decrease in the cycle occurs.
at the end of the cycle of increasing the interest rate, bond profitability is falling immediately, " deutsche said.
strategies charles schwab says these interest rate increases will bring the profitability between short-term and long-term bonds closer together, singing the cleaning.
high-cost bonds do better in such an environment, although " we are still cautious about forcing profitability, " fixed income analyst kathy jones said in an analysis.
interestingly, jones is of the opinion that markets have already adapted to the expectations of edf policy.
" apart from from the power of the dollar and the estimated disinflation inflation, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy, " jones wrote.
short-term interest rates have risen, the cleaning of profitability is fairer, the average credit interest rate spreads expanded and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the edf tightens the policy.
by general, companies operating in the us will benefit from increasing interest rate increases and local products will become more attractive.
the high-debt multinationals will suffer because the dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
" history shows that " quality " stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months after an initial interest rate increase, " analyst goldman sachs said in a report to customers.
strong balance sheets firms surpassed a poor balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
companies with high capital revenues and low volatility stocks also surpassed similar low-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
debt will become an important issue.
the companies with a large percentage of the fleet debt have the most to lose, goldman says.
consumers will also benefit from dollar increase.
rescuers could also benefit, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
bbc radio 3 is a copy after fm classics, says parliament member andrew bingham
conservative mp andrew bingham criticised radio for " fooling "
he says he is increasingly similar to the trade opponent.
it also took the bbc music awards in the eye, saying they seized the brits awards.
colleague damien collins attacked the voice, saying the programme was not original either.
bbc radio 3 " is turning into " fm classics, a senior mp said, putting pressure to prove he is doing something that commercial stations do not do.
conservative mp andrew bingham also told bbc heads that public radio " prostish " and increasingly resembles the trade opponent.
" i have the impression that radio 3 " foish " -- although i don't like to use the word -- but i have the impression that it is turning into fm classics, " he said.
it also took the bbc music awards launched last december.
bbc music awards, launched last year, appears to be brits under another name.
so if you try to do something different -- these are the two examples that come to mind that only copy what already exists on the market, " mr bingham said.
the bbc general director has denied the accusations, saying the bbc radio 3 is well ahead of his commercial opponent in live music and public education.
i will find out anywhere about the classical music from radio 3.
and his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
" moreover, i think it's commitment of radio 3 to discover new music and the allocation of new plays is also important, " he said.
in the first part of this year, bbc radio 3 editor alan davey said he must do more to attract the previous period because the british have less knowledge of classical music.
but radio 3 was not the only element under the bbc logo criticised at a meeting of the culture, media and sports committee for following the footsteps of its trading rivals.
conservative mp damien collins attacked the voice -- the bbc talent show from dutch producer talpa media for about gbp 2million.
do you understand why there is often discussion that issue because it is not original and does not distinguish by anything?
lord hall insisted that the bbc1 show -- avring paloma faith and boy george in juriu -- be conducted " in a bbc specific manner. "
he added that he wants the corporation " to find golden chicken eggs in its own ograde " next time it launches an entertainment show.
however, he refused to ban in future from taking over new seasons from the voice or spend money on other entertainment licenses.
internet sales registered the lowest increase in august, and the culprt could be black.
in the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
there has been the slower growth since 2000 in the past month.
online sales gained momentum three years ago due to the use of mobile phone to shopping.
experts say the november black record could lead reluctant to spending.
for more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned british commercial streets into phantom cities.
experts, however, say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, with the latest figures indicating a only 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
the total money spent in august presented the lowest growth since 2000, with an increase of only 5 per cent over the past year.
experts say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, with the latest figures indicating a only 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
" if we look at the level of growth in previous years and return to 2000, there has always been a tendency of rationalised over time, " andy mulcahy, editor andy imrg sales index, told guardian.
he explained that online sales gained momentum three years ago, when buyers began using mobile phone to shopping.
thus, the number of people who could make online has increased and do so under different circumstances, such as canwing.
but now that it is stagnating a little, you could see a decrease (in growth).
the black civilisation phenomenon, imported from america, is cited as one of the reasons for the fall in sales.
in specialists' view, buyers would refrain from making purchases ahead of the event, which took place on the last friday of november.
last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked in front of computers to put hands on offers, leading to the collapse of several retailers.
experts say the black tea, when buyers beat on bargains, could lead to the reluctance of shoppers.
a british retail consortium showed that at least 1 1 from every 5 life is spent online.
in the case of certain products, such as tv sets and washing cars, more than a third of purchases are currently made via online shops.
at the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes rather than to turn to fashion shops in commercial areas.
after sanctions against bin laden family, muslims bury victims killed as a result of the collapse in mecca
the bodies of 29 those who lost their lives were walk on muslim streets, with the first funeral held in mecca.

the sad memory kept by the holy place, where a construction butcher through the mosque collapsed just a few days ago, falling believers.
the bodies were released for the funeral after saudi arabia's king penalised the bin laden family construction group for disaster, which also resulted in 394 injured.
at a ceremony on the street, hundreds of muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed due a cranes at the grand mosque in mecca.
among the victims were four children's father, qasim akram, from bolton, great manchester, in his first pilgrimage when the bloodshed collapsed.
mr akram is in the great mosque with his parents before hajj pelgrigriage annually.
saudi authorities have already promised that hajj pilgrigrimage in mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrigrims still reaching the city.
today, king salman said the binladin group should not have left the arm of the butcrcher was not in operation.
an arab version of the decree, published by the saudi news agency, said the binladin group bears partly blame for collapse.
the news agency's english service did not present the detail, but said company leaders were banned from leaving the country.
earlier this week, salman vowed to reveal what caused the cranes collapse in the great mosque court, where hundreds of thousands of muslims came before hajj pelgrigrige later this month.
the binladin group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the butanes and group representatives could not be contacted for statements.
the royal decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and failing to coordinate its work with weather authorities.
dozens of cranes surrounding the great mosque in mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the binladin group.
for several decades, the binladin family has had a close relationship with saudi arabia's royal family and has been carrying out major construction projects.
the last qqaeda leader, osama bin laden laden, was a " reneged " son inherited from the family in the 1990s.
the collapse occurred under strong wind and rain, just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in pelgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the lives of every physically pressed muslim.
authorities say 158 people remain.
authorities have decided that relatives of the deceased victims should receive one million saudi arabia (gbp 174,000) and the same amount should be paid to those with permanent injuries.
other injured will receive half of that amount.
advantages and disadvantages of credit conversion into swiss francs
two offers for converting credit into lei into swiss francs have already appeared on the banking market, the main advantages being to exclude the currency risk and reduce rates.
disadvantages can come in a few years' time, when variable interest can lead to increased rates.
the transylvania bank has just completed the credit converting into francs granted by volksbank, and the post bank conversion offer for its own customers.
according to data cumulated by analysts from the finzoom financial portal, the post bankoffers three years of fixed interest rate in lei of 1.5%, the lowest market market.
on the other hand, the offer to convert the transylvania bank was accepted by 83% of customers with credit in the franci due to two successive cuts: the balance of risk and administration fees paid by the customer, then an additional reduction of 22.5% in the soil in lei was applied.
both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared as they paid equivalent in lei monthly before conversion.
thus, transylvania bank is cutting the rate by 42.5% and bankpost, by 33% in the first three years and theoretically, by 18% in the coming years.

the main advantage of the ket in credit lei in the chf is that foreign exchange risk is eliminated, with the consumer protected by future franc increases, and credit repayment will be made in the currency where he receives his salary.
another major advantage of both offers of conversion is that there is no reassessment of property, no additional guarantees and other proof of income.
in practical terms, no new financial and legal analysis of credit will be carried out, nor will there be additional costs as in the event of re-financing.
both banks also offer a reduction at the monthly rate, compared to customers paid before converting, equivalent to lei.

the problem is that the early years rate is made up more of interest and the client is repaying very little mainly.
the very low-interest bankoffer during the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
it is not known, however, how this interest will develop after three years.
the margin given to customers can be more than 3.25%, so in total, the cost reduction is also lower.
a possible risk to all credits in variable interest lei is for the robor index to increase significantly over the coming years (more than the libor index - chf).
for example robor at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, over 15% in 2009, and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
in addition, other costs may also arise, not mentioned in its initial offer.
the time has come for decisions on the us interest rate for the us federal reserve.
the world is looking at a scheduled meeting in two days' time, wednesday and thursday, when the us federal reserve will make a crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
in a reuters poll with the participation of 80 economists, just over half who last week thought the decision would be made, i now think the situation will remain for some time and that interest rates would be kept within the current 0-0.25% range.
this is an historic event because it is seven years since the federal reserve brought rates to zero.
for the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could drop zero and initiate a process of normalising interest rates, " said angel ubide, chief analyst with the peterson institute for international economics.
the us economy has evolved relatively well, with the recovery bringing usd trillion into the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
however, the federal reserve must not ignore the less rosy global situation.
warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
the decision will be announced on tuesday 20: 00 the tec.

player luke shaw of manchester united has been sitting on the bar for months because of double fracres.
luke shaw suffered a double fracon right leg in manchester united's champions league match, with a defeat to psv eindhoven.
after the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and will keep the bar for at least six months, louis van gaal remains optimistic that shaw will be able to play this season again.
the injury followed a reckless intervention by héctor moreno in the 15th minute after shaw, 20, broke psv defence.
he received medical care for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
van gaal said, " he has a double fracture on the foot and is in hospital. "
it will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps the day after then operated in manchester.
it is appalling - a boy who came to manchester united when he was 18 years old has difficulties, then plays fantastic and now this is happening.
oxygen was mask in the west.
the complaint.
i am not a doctor, but at the double fracture it is six months and will not play in the group phase.
i hope that it can play this season again.
moreno is said to have had good luck and have escaped the red card and the concession of a coup.
referee nicola rizzoli has not mexican.
van gaal suggested italian official was wrong.
you can judge alone when i say that it is a foul and red card.
it was a very ugly intervention with two legs.
a message on shaw's twitter account:' thank you all for your messages, i do not have words to express how weakened i feel, the road to recovery, i will come back stronger'.

the defender of england's team has another reason to recover to play at the european championship in france next june.
phillip cocu, coach psv, said it is a very ugly injury. "
everyone is very sad when a player suffers such injury.
our players never seek to injury an adversary.
moreno broke his leg by playing for mexico's national against the national team of the netherlands led by van gaal at the 2014 world championship.
" it is very difficult for her because he did not intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it is a very serious injury, it is not good, " cocu said.
i have not seen phase.
i only managed to see the ball, which was heading in different direction, so it seemed [moreno] achieved it but i could not see intervention against luke.
in his statement for sbs6, moreno said: i know how it is, i know how difficult it is to pass this.
i feel bad, i am so sorry.
psv player andrés guardado also came to hospital after an intervention from chris smrevski.
adam lyth clearly risked england's omission, but still
the victory over pakistan in the united arab emirates is a difficult task, but having seen england's team for the tournament, i am not considering a 3-0 repeat in the test.
i would not eliminate a travel victory either.
alastair cook's team may have less experience than three years ago, but it has good players on the batting line and collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by 2012 2012 events but will have a positive attitude to youth.
moegrali develops as a thorner and adil rashid, even if unknown at the test level, is an option for the attack.
similar topics: adam lyth left england's team for test matches and was replaced by alex hales
obviously, as his head coach at yorkshire, i find it difficult to look at the decision not to select adam lyth on the team.
he played the seven test matches against two good kers under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are being tried by results.
there have been no question marks about joe root, for example, until announcements have been made because - and i have said this before - the players are their own selected.
a fifty years and can lyth would have extended their run, but its destiny is in its hands.
i hope that if it does more run for yorkshire, it will receive other opportunities.
the main coach of the team of england, trevor bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance was not match his capacity and does not surprise me that; above all, he is a team man.
it is hard to answer the question of how long a batsman is noted in the test matches.
lyth had seven run -- like sam robson before him -- while nick compton had nine.
only compton had luck at home and travelling.
the only dissatisfaction you can have was that england preferred jonathan trott on the caribbean tour - when lyth was in its maximum form - but that missed opportunity is in a thing of the past.
the team comes alex hales, a batsman whom i covery well.
he is a cricket player with " factor x " and i saw early in yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a pitch trent bridge.
at least the same opportunity should be given those before opportunity, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of uae team.
the idea of moind opening beating with cook is launched, which would lead extra spinner while preserving four quiches and i have nothing against it.
i do not see why a dumter could not hit there and this clumsy player has already shown that the naïve is being given.
mosur may not bring success to his district, worcestershire, but there was no 3 for them, so the difference is not big.
my old team colleague, justin langer, played his first 38 test matches 38 that the first putbefore they entered the open in 2001.
it deleted three centuries immediately and did not look behind.
zafar rasari is team back-up spinner and, although i had limited contact with him, he was struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
people could judge the early age -- with an average of 31 at beating and 35 at the ball -- and think it is a bag, but there is no lot of thorny and the selection opted for young people.
it will learn a lot from this tournament.
england has also made some changes to the coaches team.
the appointment of mahela jayawardene, sri lanka's batsman, as consultant for test matches could be a coup.
he is one of the best players and will bring a great deal of experience, as he played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
paul collingwood comes for white-ball link to the tournament and will bring both energy and non-ruthless ambition.
i have always believed he was born to become involved in the international cricket, whether as a player or as coach, and like mahela, has the intktion.
sometimes, new voices in the west, even if they send out messages that have been sent before, can bring fresh air to the team.
colly durham's teammate, ben stokes rest for matches one day root has received a similar break against australia, and i have no problem with that.
while not all agree, the coaches and selection do not make the programme.
and you have to remember, players' jobs depend on the results they achieve.
such decisions are never easy.
brexit camp could prevail if the economy remains in heat by 2017
every day, the strategy for renegotiating david cameron to keep britain entering the eu is more into the mess, even without the election of geniant jeremy " yes or no? " corbyn helm of the labour party or tuc makes serious criticism of europe on tuesday.
foreigners also have figures such as corbyn and nigel farages.
a european diplomat explained in the past days that - submerged in crises similar to that in the eu - not all caused internally - some member states are fuelled by britain's agenda by concessions and changes to the treaties, which most do not want.
in brighton, at its annual meeting, tuc decided that they do not want if they eroded social protection.
we could even call it dave and george's' sel' agenda.
the prime minister and chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, make a picture before a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and say they won allies for reform.
it is only me.
my european friend, who wants britain looking outward under the roof of the eu -- " do not leave us alone with france, " berlin says -- suggests several ministers and officials from some capitals have reached the point where they do not care whether they remain or leave.
angela merkel, the highly cauously german chancellor, is an ally but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave position before her situation totses, as did thatcher (11 years), mitterrand (14) and kohl (16), who stood too long.
in 2017, french president françois hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
its power is also in decline.
poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, spain left-wing government.
it is hard to believe that they will help english who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent scotland from leaving britain - something they do not want either because most have similar separatist trends.
thus, some ministers may even plan to make remarks intentionally that do not help, in the snp style, in the referendum campaign in britain in 2017 to speed up the brexit process, my bitter suggests.
" renegotiation was fixed " and " britain has achieved nothing renegotiation. "
europeans know on their skin how ackers jakup street can be and how sceptical the oligarchic media barons are who view the eu with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by tony benn, which ratified our entry since 1973 into report 2: 1.
perhaps he vaguely remember boris johnson, the euro-opportunistic, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was brussels' dissident.
miliband knew.
they included the mixture of duty-payers, foreigners foreigners of telephone fraud and pseudo non-domes who hold most important newspapers.
in fact, tony blair sees them rather the same, but realised that when you are shut down in a cuw with a nervous gorla, you have to give him the bananas to distract his attention from the thought of eating at lunch and again at tea.
in fact, miliband was smilder than blair in opposition to cameron's idea of a referendum, as blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned eu constitution buried by french and dutch voters in 2005, who gave him an exit card.
the media has not forgive him for that either.
but jeremy corbyn, who reached my friendship by him at westminster on monday - i told him not to spend his time with me - seems to be in adopting the murdoch's boycotting neil kinnock of the 1980s, a mistake then from ou.
it may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy for with the media, not with me, but certainly with andrew marr whose position in the bbc left holiday sunday.
corbyn's official position towards europe is what i would call development.
he says he would like in a reformed eu.
most of those who disagree with conservative' anglicism' could agree to that.
she said hilary " a benn, but not a benane " benn on radio and tv this week, when his researcher struggled not to recognise that byn's appointment of john mcdonnell as corbyn as " shadow " minister on financial matters was a bad idea.
he reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on tv to be unfair to labour colleagues without going too far and without losing his job.
hilary's fight more attractive.
but the fight to remain " in any situation " -- benn's expression -- does not correspond to what mcdonnell said, nor what jc told colleagues and lawmakers at a private meeting monday night.
whatever image corbyn wants to convey - remember, it has also made me aware - the discipline of messages remains important in the television age, and particularly in the varieties of social media, a paranoia and treason.
it is right not to give cameron a favour ticket in europe, allowing him to take good labour support in the referendum campaign, as mcdonnell said.
simon jenkins certainly believes this.
but the basic sohiia of mcdonnell and corbyabout eu membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a hesitant discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom small differences's narrism of small differences is a central dogma.
as with his sohiia on nato - tom watson is adamant that the jc will not campaign for giving ation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
why should paris or berlin waste political capital - and there there are suspicious voters - for concessions towards britain when everything could be pointless?
the us is already rather disappointed about the english's poor military performance in iraq, libya and syria, even with a cost-cutting conservative government government, as i was reminded of the launch of the british stari security forum on monday.
specialists criticise england's public health department decision on electronic cigarettes
according to researchers, claims by a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry.
specialists from the editorial team of the british medical journal (bmj) joined the lantec in criticising evidence used by the england of england's public health department (une) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
the iaea published its " reference " report last month and described it as a " complex analysis of the evidence. "
several researchers, however, have questioned the data robustness and pointed the finger at links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
an report published last month in the lantec medical magazine attacked the " extraordinarily fragile basis " on which it founded its main conclusion.
two other researchers writing in bmj have questioned the claims and basing them " on solid soil or on moving sand. "
martin mckee, a professor of european public health in the london school of tropical tropical europe, and simon capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at university of liverpool, said, " a fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on proof effectiveness. "
they said they expected claims that " current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking " are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
in reality, only one meeting attended by 12 people led to the drafting of a multi-decision-making analysis (mcda) summarising their views on the negative effects associated with various products containing nico; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research work.
mckee and capewell or said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called euroswiss health, whose executive director said in the past received funding from british american tobacco for an independent study.
he also validated bat accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
they added that one of 12 participants in the meeting said funding from a producer of electronic cigarettes, but not funding there are reports would have received from the cigarette and tobacco-producing company philip morris international.
the arguments on the basis of which the's members were not selected, but these include some " frks " known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare financing the industry in work.
other participants in the meeting are not known for tobacco control expertise.
the head of the tobacco control station station also attended the meeting.
the research work drawn up by the group " convincingly muses " the fact that there is a lack of " solid evidence of the detrimental effect most products have according to most criteria, " mckee and capewell said.
however, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the codified report.
mckee and capewell said the claims that " so far, there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers " are premature.
professor kevin fenton, director of the same health department, says he responded in the past to claims in bmj.
he said electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking "
one in two people smoking all their lives lose their lives because of this vice.
all evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic cigarettes for health are minor, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
emu has a clear duty to inform the public about the information arising and those that does not emerge from evidence, particularly given the high level of public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
every year, around 0,000 people lose their lives due to a smoking-related disease, and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking reach gbp 2 billion.
making the current evidence clear - that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risk, they present only a fraction of the detrimental effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national debt.

amnesty's film had more than 100,000 facebook visual phes within 24 hours and was created by the vccp advertising agency which worked pro bono, while graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked free of charge.
ccp creation director matt lever was shocked by the silence around the complaint for the arms fair -- with a empty space on the excel calendar -- and thought " to give them the campaign he is trying to avoid. "
they were played with the realisation of a more realistic advertising but " enriching it with strong animations and colours, it was more striking. "
" they have done a great job helping us increase interest in selling illegal torture equipment within the fair, " tom davies says on behalf of amnesty.
now the uk authorities would need to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
perhaps the most creative form of art on the arms fair comes from inside excel, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphememisproducts.

violinist david grimal: there were no world tournaments during bach's era.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people working, artists and not commercial representatives.
french violinist david grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a list but also as initiator of a less ordinary project, downright' strange', as he himself says, les dissoncin - an orchestra of international soloists and talented musicians who performs a logical repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiology.
les dissonunewas at the enescu festival this year with two performances: a performance on sunday, in which solist was david grimal, founder of the orchestra, and one monday when violinist xavier phillips was at the forefront, with works comcomposed by enescu being nelipsite.
both performances, held on the athens stage, showed the public another kind of interpreting classical music.
les dissonrit appeared on the music scene in 2004, at the time, being the only classic music whole in which there was no conductor.
conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
it is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - i speak of instrumolers, not composers.
they are trained as specialised workers'.
they themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.
on the other side of the scene, for the public, all the musical complaint focuses on the conductor.
thus, businesswoman, the music industry, is making its marketing.
therefore, we are no longer talking about music.
so if we look at this world, we have qualified workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and a public who cannot listen, but he has to look, which and it is stupid, " david grimal believes.
the violinist tells that the change in the way music came from " musical deception " in his solist career.
i was like a high-level athlete who was supposed to conduct the same exercise worldwide with different orchestras, earn a lot of money and bring money and the music industry.
10 years ago, when i was around 30 years old, i found this very depressing, because we no longer found human creativity and fraternity in this system.
so i have found no sense to continue along this path.
that is how i decided to create les les dissonre.
this was in 2004, and at that time no one was doing so without a conductor:' the highly conservative music world did not want such projects'.
" how do you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no longer ego? " the artist asks.
david grimal acknowledges that les dissonaces is " a luxury, " saying that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
in 10 years of existence of ensemble, the lack of a conductor did not prove to be hindrance in the music act: " curiously, the more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present. "
in grimal's view, the ennescu festival is a' very courageous' one, precisely because it also invited les dissonsey:' an extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras in the world and 3 times a day are present, and in these orchestras you also invited this strange group'.
in a temple of orchestras tradition, such as the ennescu festival, there is the place and interest in something different, which breaks barriers.
speaking about enescu's work, the violinist acknowledges he feels romanian music of the famous romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when introducing enescu works on his repertoire.
grimal notes that enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is when we talk about george enescu and romanian music, " because there is also a george enescu who made french music. "
grimal advocates to change in the way classical musical education is done, considering that " the profession of musician, as organised today, has a death flflour " and that' the future of music is music itself. "
we do not need to tour the world 5 times a year if it serves nothing.
during bach's era, there were no world tournaments.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were working people who were artists and not commercial representatives.
for me, organising concerts, festivals, tournaments, the launch of albums, they are all formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done at the service of music.
if not, we are in a system in which creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
to illustrate this phenomenon, david grimal set an example to romanian products before and post-accession to the european union:' in romania, before you entered the eu, you had good vegetables and meat'.
to enter the eu, you had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
production and agriculture are reaching the service of supermarkets, as is the case in france.
with music the same thing happens, it is the same logic.

in an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and for the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with education policy.
" if we considered -- as the koreans, the japanese do -- that western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its learning into school, we would reintroduce concerts on television and through this education there would no longer need to sell musical by-products, " grimal believes.
there are certainly things in classical music education that remains very communist, everywhere, is something very militarised.
it depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if we form a musician who will perform an instrument and, above all being a musician.
this is about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) it must in some way, if we want to form a musician, it is something else.
after your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? " the french artist asks smiling.
grimal shows that for artists, the reward of another kind of doing music comes precisely from overcoming this status as a " soldier, " overcoming what " they believe are their limits: " musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, which is why after the concert are smilators. "
david grimal spoke about his music project and his vision of music and the artist in the " festival of ideas, " a discussion with public public at the george enescu international festival by the aspen romania institute.

cinema city seeks big voices "
cinema city launches the biggest challenge for children: doubling two characters from the superproduction " 3d snow "
do you have a super talented and spontaneous child, who likes films?
it gives him the opportunity to see.
in september, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children willing to arrive up future stars, between 8 to 16, cinema city is looking for " " small big voices, " giving them an extraordinary opportunity to double two figures from a famous animation film.
if emphasis was placed in classical drawings on bringing the actor voice closer to the specificnature of the animated figure in times, those who are to interpret the voices are also taken into account on creating the stories, and they are usually well-known actors.
cinema city romania, however, wants to discover new voices, which is why we are starting an unprecedented campaign.
we want to find the right voice and we challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
they will have special experience, because the characters are sympatic and aftershocks are funny.
" children will enjoy themselves and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors, " said ioana ionescu, manager of cinema city romania.
in the first competition stage, from september 11th to september 30th, cinema city is organising a pre-screen that resulted 10 children (five girls and five boys) elected who will have the opportunity to take a event at a record studio with professionals.
all parents have to do is access the reduced emissions platform .cinema-city.ro, where they enroll the child in the competition and prepare it for the voice event.
then they have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is to read and then the child will be interpreted by his own double version.
four films about friendship, basm heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the event: " yellow 3d slops, " " mune: 3d guard, " " arky bill: koala cel poznas 3d " and " albinuta maya 3d. "
finally, the two most talented children (one girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and each double one superproduction figure " the snow queen -- craber of the 3d snow, " which will premiere in romania this november.
fedex gains mixed, fiscal forecasts for 2016
fedex said disappointing results for the last quarter, with the supply giant reducing profit estimates for the whole year due to low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
the company also said it plans to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for holiday period.
during the same period last year, fedex announced would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for holiday period.
the company's shares fell by about 2.5 per cent in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before wednesday's opening wednesday.
fedex corp. said he expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next may, with 20 cents less, according to a earlier estimate.
analysts expected $10.84, according to a poll factset.
falling estimate comes despite the rise in prices by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 january and the higher land transport charge of large or heavy weight packages, which will apply since november.
the company said it still expects increased gains from the previous year due to reduced costs, higher incomes and the development of online trade.
president and director general fred smith said " the firm faces a considerably weaker economic situation expected, especially with regard to global production and trade. "
employment plans during the holidays were announced a day after ups competitor said it plans to employ additional 90,000-95,000 workers, about the same number of employment it made last year.
in the quarter that ended on 31 august, fedex won $692m, 6% more than the previous year.
earnings per action were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per action 12 analysts who responded to the zacks investment research survey.
profits increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
six analysts who participated in zacks survey estimated $12.23 billion.
fedex has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to stagnation in revenues from its express unit.
but the explosion in online shopping the results of the fedex ground division.
in the last quarter, revenues of the ground division rose by 29%, but operational revenues practically due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
the express unit registered an increase in revenues due to higher basic tariffs, while cfsp division revenues have fallen due to rising costs.
in the pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, fedex shares shares by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
the closure tuesday dropped 11 per cent year-on-year on tuesday and 17 per cent compared to the record maximum on 11 june.
at the most expected meeting in recent years, policymakers within the federal reserve will spend two days this week around a table of mahon honduras an 27 to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
above them, at an end of meetings of the central bank, a us diral painting will be terminup.
the map is intended to recall that janet l. yellen, chairman of the edf, and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all.
the central bank has been given a dual task from congress: to maximise the employment rate in the us and maintain price stability.
but since the great economic crisis, edf leaders confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
and this third task could be factor x in a decision too difficult to predict to be announced on tuesday, and which will determine whether the us economy is ready to be broken by the unprecedented stimulus offered by almost zero short-term interest rate in force from the end of 2008.
even though the majority of data indicate a strongly growing economy, the recent turmoil on the global financial markets could frighten edf officials already wary of adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds -- even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
" obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will follow, " said lindsey m. piegza, chief economist at brokeraj firm stifel nicolaus & co.
" but i think that if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait any longer, " she said.
there is no consensus on the decision that the edf will take, in itself causing instability in the financial market.
about half of the economists recently questioned by bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
but the financial markets expect the edf to postpone a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30%.
this would indicate a decrease on the stock exchange if the edf increases the interest rate unless policymakers mitigate the blow by promising a long time before the next growth.
on tuesday, average industrial dow jones moved 28.89 points, or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
the momentum was triggered by expectations that edf decision makers will maintain stable interest rate this week, said john lonski, chief economist at moody's capital markets research group.
" it would be surprising if the edf were to increase the interest rate at this point, " lonski said.
if edf decision makers did so,' they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets'.
other experts have stated that an increase in interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the edf acts.
just a month ago, the edf seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the force of us recovery.
yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected an interest rate increase this year despite objections raised by liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
although job creation slowed down in august, labour market growth was strong this year.
unemployment dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the edf as full employment.
wage gains showed signs of growth.
and although inflation has continued not to achieve the central bank's annual goal, edf decision makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices.
the economy " can face higher rates and needs them, given tension in the labour market, " said ian shepherdson, chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics.
but global financial markets began entering fibrilations at the end of this month, after china devalued its currency.
industrial average dow jones industrial fell 16% below the record maximum achieved in may, as investors feared that slowdown down the chinese economy would pull down world growth.
the market observed somewhat this month, with the dow index now about 10% below the may maximum.
for edf decision makers, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of time of interest rates is rising.
" without what happened on the financial markets and news of weakening the chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be stronger at the meeting, " said stephen d. oliner, an experienced researcher at the ucla ziman centre for real estate and former edf official.
now he expects to wait at least a month to manage the effects better.
" there is a great deal of uncertainty about what the impact on the us economy will be and they almost do not have data on which to subsequently based on events in china, " oliner said.
the well-being of the global economy is not one of the edf's major interests, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision making.
in reality, however, the edf has become monetary authority.
in recent years, the central bank's influence has been huge.
simply alluding by then president ben s. bernanke in 2013, that the edf could' narrow' its monetary expansion triggered earthquake in world markets.
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly mixed, edf officials are expected not only to monitor progress made in other areas, but also to other central banks and experts in order to better interpret the world economy.
his decision-making process is " more art than science, " said zachary karabell, head of the global strategy department at welfare management firm envestnet inc.
jeffrey lacker, president of the federal reserve bank in richmond, va, said this month that " the edf has an oversized response history to financial market changes that appear not related to economic bases. "
lacker, a voting member of the decision-making federal open market commission, which supported the interest rate increase, set the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
a financial crisis that affected asia has led the edf to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, " despite implications with limited identification possibility for us development, " lacker said.
a year later, edf officials returned to those falls.
the edf should raise the issue of financial stability first in event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, adam s. posen, a former member of the interest rate setting bank of england, said.
the last turbulent period falls far at that level, he said.
" we certainly do't want to get in a situation to fear an increase in interest rates because the markets have upset, " said posen, president of peterson institute for international economics.
the federal reserve act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, i do not think it should take premature action.

4 died after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in nepal
four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern nepal after police fired rubber bullets at at a crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said wednesday.
the violence occurred late tuesday in the rupandehi district, about 280km west of kathathmandu capital.
according to bishnu prasad dhakal, the district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, while some threw stones and molotov cocktails.
mr dhakal said police forces used tear gas before shooting the air before turning to the use of rubber bullets.
twenty police officers and five civilians.
it was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
the clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of nepal, where members of the madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
protests also existed in western nepal, where the tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes triggered on 10 august,
when four key political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces -- a major step towards a new constitution, however, a highly controversial issue in nepal, a country centrally governed for hundreds of years.
the procedure for drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in april.
this week in kathathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution, and officials said the new charter could be adopted on sunday.

hardreduction surgery could be useful in the case of easy obesity diabetations
the benefits of the cyury to reduce weight with easy obesity, with type 2 diabet sugar, may remain for at least five years, according to a new study.
it is still premature to say whether easy obesity diabetcs live longer after surgweight intervention than those following unhirurgical treatments.
" it takes a long time to centralise mortality data, " said dr. robin blackstone, a obesity surgery specialist, she wrote an article on the new study in jama une.
overloss operations, named as barrier surgery, use various methods to reduce the dental.
they reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
over the years, barrier barrier surgery has proved effective in the treatment of 2-sugar diabetes, but most studies were conducted on morbida obesity people, with a corporate mass index (imc).
the imc, a unit of weight in relation to live up, is considered normal between 18.5 to 24.9.
the imc value of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and people over 30 are considered obese.
you can calculate your imc by accessing: 1 usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
for the new study, researchers at taiwan's min-sheng general hospital used used data gathered after 2007 in a perception comparing two types of barrier ric surgery - bypass gastric and gastrectomie in manson - in the medical treatment of 2-type diabetes sugar to light obesity.
the average imc to people suffering surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year as part of study.
meanwhile, the imc to people who received unhirurgical treatments against sugar diabetes remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
of those suffering surgery, diabetes zaharat fully healed to 36% and partly to 28%.
in the treaty group by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes sugar has fully healed to only 1% and partly to just 2% of subjects.
in addition, control of terrible tension, triglicerids and lmr " esterol " bad " were generally better in the surgeical group, " the authors concluded.
researchers also monitored the sanguin level of hemoglobina a1c, which reflects the level of gphony over time.
researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobina a1c is below 7%.
after surgical intervention, hemoglobina a1c's average level fell from around 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
but in the treaty with medical methods, it stood at around 8%.
but this improved " glicthermal control " -- reflected in improved hemoglobina a1c levels -- have not reduced the death rate to five years, according to chief researcher dr. chih-cheng hsu and colleagues.
the research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
in the fifth year, compared to the gastrectomie group in manson, the intervention group of bypass surgery lost more in weight (18.7 compared to 14.2 kg), recorded more considerable falls in the imc value (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobina a1c (3.1% to 2.1%) and showed and showed higher higher ability of a complete etetet.
although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence of a study by heavy weight weight sursurical intervention extends life, says blackstone of arizona university, the faculty of medicine - phoenix.
in the swedish study, obese people suffering from barrier surgery presented a probability about 29% less to die after 15 years, compared to a group that has tried more conventional methods.
although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients who suffered surgical intervention, blackstone called it an optimistic issue for the imc under 35 interested in the procedure.
" this is the point where this work is critical, because it says this surgical intervention is safe in the lower imc group, " without increasing the risk of death or renal disease, she says.
blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start -taking seriously then the patient's imc reaches 27-30.
" i think we are waiting too long before we urge people to take this seriously, " she said.
i believe that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that shortened their bodies by ecting them to obesity and diabet, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
" it is impossible for everyone to come to europe " -- the dalai lama - rt news.
europe could not receive all refugees, the dalai lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of refugee crisis lies in the middle east.
the tibetan buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in mother countries of refugees.
the dalai lama spoke about the current refugee crisis problem in his speech at the opening of oxford dalai lama for compassion centre, dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to britain.
he said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even every continent.
he also stressed that while admirable, the western european countries' response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
" it is impossible for everyone to come to europe, " he said in his speech.
although the dalai lama praised efforts of germany and austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
" concern for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but the same time need to think about long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, to muslim countries, " he stressed.
essentially, we need to think about ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
we need to reduce use of force.
force has never solved these problems, " he added.
on the issue of violence, the dalai lama also commented on george bush's actions following the 11 september terrorist attacks, saying that the violent response from the us generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
after the events of 11 september, i expressed my condolences in a letter to president bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
i know his reasons were strong, but he used force and generated unexpected consequences, " the dalai lama said.
a four-fold increase in hate detergent children over the past 4 years
according to the anti-poisoning centre in georgia, us anti-poisoning centres have reported an increase of around 400% since 2010 in terms of number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed red detergent hands with high alcohol hands.
according to dr gaylord lopez, director of georgia's anti-poisoning centre, cases of ingeroure hands detergents in children under the age of 12 reported to anti-poisvire centres climbed from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
" children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the emergency chamber, " lopez told cnn.
lopez said some children intentionally drink detergent and others did to impress their friends or respond to challenges on social media.
films can be watched on youtube showing teenagers how they were deterggent in order to create cheap drinages.
teenagers are said to have offended alcohol-mouth water detergents in order to obtain a louder drink.
smaller children can be drawn to the attractive smell of detergents.
" a child doesn't think he is harming them, " lopez says.
many of the most attractive types (of detergent hands) are perfsmoking.
goberk detergents, strugure, orange are the most attractive to children.
hand detergents contains about 45-95 per per cent of alcohol.
in young children, only a few swallowed can cause alcohol poisoning.
" it's very focused alcohol, " dr stephen thornton, medical director of the anti-poisoning centre at kansas university hospital, told kansas city's fox 4 channel.
thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these detergents of hands in accessible places, and if the small ones reach them, this is a rapid way to consume a lot of alcohol.
nhaijah sell, a six-year-old who recently fought at school the equivalent of four spraes with straberlic deterberhands, has reached the emergency chamber to receive treatment.
it had blood 179 alcohol, twice the threshold that an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to dr chris ritchey, a emergency chamber doctor who treated her at the gwinnett medical centre outside atlanta.
nhaijah balmajea and could not go when she arrived at the emergency chamber.
doctors monitored it overnight at a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain, because the girl fell and hit to the head because of alcohol, ritchey said.
" it was frightening, " ortoria scott, mother of nhaijah, told cnn.
he could have been fatal to him.
lopez urged parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or servicds and stop leaving detergents available to children.
in addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
in 2013, two ontario women died after swing detergent hands containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
health authorities assumed that the product contained methane, a lethal substance, rather than alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
in january, three fourth-class students in northern new york plded to poisison their professor " bad " by " by putting anti-bacterial products in class, " according to a police report.
the teacher is very allergic in detergent hands and banned him in his room.
police viewed the plan " small " and submitted the disciplinary problem to the school inspectorate.

absence of scots into the race for title ii bores dutch
former midfielder from rangers and former dutch international player ronald de boer said dutch football fans have lost interest in celtic -- because they are not debating for rangers.

we feel the same - but we must go further.
we really need the support of celtic because this also makes the players better.
it is extremely important that we remain united now.
warburton's caution regarding

in the case of players transferred in the summer, there is the period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could see this season in our group.
the team is doing very well.
sometimes you do more harm if you bring players who are not needed.

why see execution in oklahoma
during today, apart from bellate legal intervention, i will look at how a man is sentenced to death.
if it happens, and i hope it will happen, i will stay in a room for observers in the courtroad of oklahoma and see how richard glossip is executed by managing lethal injection.
he asked me to be one of four official witnesses his death.
the invitation came in january, via his best friend, and although i was shocked, i accepted.
as the good day approaches, i am appalled the idea.
so why?
i agreed because i thought it was a good way to tell the story of capital punishment.
it would offer perspective.
admittedly, journalists can see executions in america and, because applications usually exceed the number of seats available, a macabra lottery is taking place to decide who will be elected.
oklahoma has reduced the number of reserved media representatives from 12 to five.
those elected will view execution impartiality.
i cannot do
i would sit next to richard glossip's closest friends, moreover i developed my own link with him during months of telephone conversations and a two-half-hour visit.
i like.
we often ragh a great deal when we speak.
prison authorities say i cannot witness a journalist, so i will not be allowed to have a carpet and a pix to me to note what i see.
i will have to try to remember all the details.
a journalist from oklahoma accused twitter of compromising my impartiality.
that is.
it tells the story as he wants, it gains access.
i complained.
he acknowledged " he could have formula better, " but still believes i am wrong.
richard glossip disagreed with some of the things i said and wrote.
he does not tell me what to write, and i would not do even if they asked me.
i told him he could remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
but he wants an international report to be present that writes on the subject.
it believes that, if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
kim bellware, a reporter for huffington post, will be with me.
if you want to find out more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that we have made.
i will not come back to all the details here.
i cannot say certainty that richard glossip innocent.
his actions following the murder of barry van treese are him guilty of complicity.
but i think he are likely not be guilty of the murder.
i certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
i implementation is wrong.
and i will look at it dying from this perspective.
i cannot claim totally objective.
to do so, you can read articles written by other reporters.
from me you will find out how it is to view a man i like dying unnecessarily.
peter moody claims stewarps tried to spy on him, threatens to withdraw from races
peter moody said stewarguard racing victory was trying to infiltrate a spy on his walls last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from races.
he has launched an attack against stewardes and the integrity department of racing victoria, saying they are conducting a personal campaign against him that filled the glass being lady tatai's removal from the race due to administered treatment on race day.
moody told fair fax media that he has always tried to do what is best for the flights and is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome at the leaders' cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
for 18 months he swallowed up his words on spspies and did not want to resle the' vulpea that does not reach grapes'.
" i was not going to say anything about that and i was quiet for a long time, but sometimes you reach such a high level of frustration that everything burbursts at once, " moody said.
it is a fact that it has continued.
sometimes you react and have to deal with the consequences, and i will have to live with what i have said.
night night i will go home and sleep.
i want to go my head high and i want the owners with whom i am working to see i strive to offer them the best.
since they start thinking that this is not the case, i have to give up the traaging.
i will have to think at that point what i will do with my certification.
earlier, moody threw the bomb in an interview with racing.com saying the integrity department tried to spy on the walls.
" eighteen months ago, terry bailey, dayle brown and dr brian stewart stood in a room with a man -- whose name i will say if asked -- and offered to engage my walls to provide information about the work there, " moody told racing.com.
i obviously consider a trisor.
if so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
robert roulston, former rvl president david moodie, current rvl and bernard saundry, current ceo of rvl, knew at the time and know today.
should i think something personal?
is it necessary for the rvl to start spinbackbone and can hold people outside tralers accountable for what is happening in industry?
do i have a bad influence on the industry?
so bad is my influence on the industry?
perhaps that is how others see.
perhaps i have to take my license and give me aside, and i have no doubt that the statements they are making now could lead them to think about this.
however, i have reached the point where i no longer care and that saddens me.
it saddens me greatly.
i will put pressure and lead them to make a decision.
my family supports me and can leave.
the traler's frustration increased with the long investigation into cobalt testing involving the leaders, and the removal led him to say he could " put his license on the table. "
moody, whose name is most often associated with training the undefeated champion black caviar, labelled the treatment rule on race day as " ridiculous " after applying on its feet of a boplde with namol or argila, which violates the rules.
it violates.
i have to take full responsibility, " he says.
one of my employees wrongly put namol on their foot.
it could have happened last night.
it could have happened yesterday, which happened.
it happened on race day.
moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment on the day of the race, for which the stewarguard opened an investigation.
it is a joke.
people who make these rules know nothing about ways.
" we all understand that rules were needed, but it went too far, " moody said.
driver who who hit and fled cobram arrested
police arrested a man after a collision with a biciclist produced in cobram at the weekend and followed by the run of the accident scene.
the biccliist was transported by helicopter to the royal melbourne hospital, seriously injured after being hit by a car on the murray valley highway early saturday.
police representatives say the driver of the car did not stop to help the injured biccliist.
on monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered police in shepparton.
he is said to be charged with fleeing the scene of the accident, failing to provide first help and other road crimes.
the cycliist, a 40-year-old man from cobram, remains admitted to stable.
coach melbourne storm craig bellamy responds to opponents in wrestling allegations.
coach melbourne storm craig bellamy named criticism of the placplates tactics his team used as " distorted topics " raised by the two main nrl favourites.
sydney coach roodeleted, trent robinson said the referees allowed the storm players " take them to the tring " the team in the storm nervous match in the qualifying final in sydney late friday.
the coach of bbane broncos, wayne bennett, made a slight reference to storm after his team's victory in the north queensland cowboys qualifying match late saturday when he called the match a " demonstration " of the rugby league and said the two teams from queensland were not little good at wrestling.
bellamy jumped in defence of the plates tactics his team addressed and said players were simply focused on " contact " when they liked.
bellamy says he gained trust after two important coaches criticised his team, meaning they were concerned storm would defeat them.
" and things don not stop there -- we didn't hear robinson's train complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2, " bellamy said on wednesday.
i can guarantee that we have not changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so just as in the last six weeks, we have indeed emphasised contact in the plates, and so we have changed the situation.
the train has been in this office for three years, and obviously has a wonderful team, so it is probably not used to losing, and it was a shock to him.
we know how it is always happening at this period of the year.
bellamy disagreed bennett's idea of " animating football, " reminding bennett's george-illawarra dragons won the championship in 2010 playing " boring " football.
wayne talks about pictuing football.
he argued his opinion by comparing his evening game with our game friday evening and spoke about how challenging the game was, " bellamy said.
i remember that in 2010, st george received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and wayne said he was not interested in it as black under the angle.
but now it has a team that can play what we would see as piting football, especially because of quick young midfielder.
that kind of game you want to do it when you have such players.
he brought that argument in 2010, he now wants everyone to take their style of play -- not any team has two midfielders like anthony milford and ben hunt to play that way.
it gives me more confidence because they are saying this because they are somewhat concerned about the match with us.
six weeks ago they were probably not think of us when they were thinking of the important matches.
bellamy also pointed out that the match between storm and roodeleted was a warmer over the score compared to the match between broncos and cowboys.
the broncos match was probably a good match, have we not seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
our match is 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, does that mean game?
or does it mean going breaks and not marry?
for me there are plans for me.
if i am talking about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
storm is freely this weekend because they won the right to play at home either with north queensland cowboys or cronulla sharks in the final of next saturday's campaign in aami park, tickets on sale next tuesday morning.
stevan hogg used the girls' phone to lure paedophiles to send images.

the girl later found and noted the disappearance of the phone, which he found in hogg's hand as he wanted.
she forgot in the phone and found the disturbing messages then immediately alerted his mother.
after arrival, police saw the five pictures then analysed computers found at the address and found " worrying " searches on the internet using terms to find indecent images of children subjects.
hogg claimed he did to " attract paedophiles " to the internet before " claiming to be a policeman to frighten them. "
eilidh robertson told the danube court, " said it is a dependence -- that he is dependent to frighpeople.
he acknowledged that he made computer searches but said he did so because he wanted to give himself as a policeman to sten paedophiles.
he was asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent his images and about asking the person to send him other pictures.
he said he did to lure.

hewlett-packard to make 30,000 layoffs
hewlett-packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 redundancies as part of the company's efforts restructuring and cost reduction in the services sector.
the p will split into two companies this year, separating the division of computers and frals from corporate hardware operations and scarling services.
the expected layoffs will cost $2.7 billion starting of the fourth quarter, hp said.
" these restructuring will bring new hewlett packard enterprise o a more competitive and sustainable cost-effective structure, " said meg whitman, president and director-general of the hp, who will lead unity after the rift.
" hewlett packard enterprise will be lower and more focused than the current hp and will hold a broad portfolio of business that will contribute to the transition of firms to the new style of business, " whitman said.

holy friend: the edy series that has taught us important lessons about the friendship between men.
the absence of similar figures in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the past 15 years.
in 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in 20-45-year-old men in britain, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
in an attempt to address the problem, the campaign against unfortunate life (feelings against solidarmiserith (calm) named 2015 as the year of the man, seeking to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
friendship is at the heart of the fight towards the success of this challenge.
a recent study on more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough many friends " with healthy mood, " his chances for recovery double.
equally, for people who are not suppressed, a circle of mental healthy friends halves the likelihood of mental disorders emerging.
of course, in order for friendship to have an effect, it must be accessible.
in this era of communication dominated by social media, where emphasis is placed on style and not on substance, the immediate character of the response often takes precedence before significant contact.
our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong figure open to fun and success, even though in reality it is isolation that dominates.
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinist values; money, the image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which further affects our mental health.
the billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that the money really does not buy happiness.
the beauty of the series friends was to the idea.
the characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed through interacting as friends.
the huur of joey and chandler's frequent embrace, when they look at football in the comfortable seats and the passion of ross for missiles came from the fact that it is known men can associate themselves with this, even though they often bow to completely explore their feelings.
as a social worker explained to me:'... my role in listening to people with the trend of suicide and depressed has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference'.
often, people who appeal to us do not feel able to speak to friends.
the old saying to ends alone is strong, as is the sense of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about the problems.
friends are one of the series that that come to mind when i try to provide more more long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
the series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
however much objective, outside intervention helps via telephone, people arrived up in times of desperair, long-term support comes from the family and close friends.
thus, if you attend this weekend in holy friendliness organised by the central comedy, with the full drafting of fills to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to coffee in central perk.
or better still, if you see someone alone in starbucks, smilile and welcome.
it is never known what difference your friendship could make.
friends are broadcast on central comedy from beginning to end -- all 236 episodes -- at hook friend.
di maria marks, helps malmo aside
angel di maria celebrates with blaise matuidi and edinson cavani after scoring malmo.
angel di maria marked in her debut match to the champions league on tuesday and helped the bsp impose to sweden's malmo.
we are still chronically presenting your match and your response to the game.
angel di maria and edinson cavani did their job, paris saint-germain starting the series of champions league group matches, with a reassuring 2-0 victory over malmo in a match at the des prunepark on tuesday.
di maria marked less than four minutes after her debut match in the bsp champions league began, bringing the french champions to the advantage although they missed a number of opportunities before securing their advantage with the kani's marked in the 61st minute.
reaching in group a with real madrid and sahtior donetk, paris needed a strong start against the swedish champions because the goal of the french team is not only to qualify for optimings but also to an improvement in the quarterfinal in each of the last three tourns.
but while taking the points, laurent blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with zlatan ibrahimovic who wasted the goal opportunity before being replaced by the team in his hometown and the club at which he began brilliant career in 1999.
" it is not easy to win at home or travel to the champions league, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference from the next rankings, even though there are still issues we need to improve throughout the season, " blanc says.
this is a good sign.
we wanted to win and did, although i am sorry that we failed to set one or two more goals.
ibrahimovic returned after injuries to one of three changes to the paris team, with a 2-2 stake home from borghex in the 1st league at the weekend, but a di maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
when he was transferred from manchester united last month, the argentine offensive midfielder was appointed man who will take the bsp to the next level to and demonstrated this when he tasared at marco verratti's care behind malmo's defence before he sutincredibly over johan wiland, in the long corner on the gate right.
but if someone expected the bsp to win by pacing fingers, they were disappointed.
malmo, who beat celtic in off-off play to reach this stage and entered the field with nine holders of national teams, with a defence from five people and two defence midfielders, was a strong adversary.
but their attack was not impressive, with exception to nikola djurdjic who passed kevin trapp's post in the 34th minute.
instead, bsp players slowed down the pace several times, giving some unnecessary passes and not completing interventions, even ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then replaced by kani even after the game resumed.
ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skilin supporting his colleagues, with his care being the one di maria sent to a t devited by wiland across the gate in the 52nd minute.
the second goal was finally scored after an hour passed from the match, thanks to cavani, uruguayan scored the sixth goal in the season after ibrahimovic passed away from maxwell's centation.
that goal removed hope from malmo that he would rebalance the score and just a superstop by wiland away for the rejection of david luiz kept the final score before the newly entel lavezzi cancelled a goal in extensions.
the team's norwegian coach in malmo, chay age, later said the bsp was one class and that " the last match we played in the champions league was last december. "
since then, we have only played in the swedish league, which is not up to the same level.
qualifications are not enough.
below the palace for the bsp.
they have done an excellent game.

more than 100 stewardese because they were too fat
air india airline lays off about 130 stewarzi and stewardese because they are overweight, the company announced late last week.
the state-owned company announced that the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is " ridiculous " and " shockingly sexist, " writes the washington post.

the quoted source shows that the strategy aims to manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions of action that reflect the policies established at european level adapted to national realities.
given the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of romania, measures are being considered for the unified and coherent management of situations resulting from the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants into romanian territory, resulting from political, social, economic or military crisis situations.

the strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in syria, reactivating the conflict in iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in surrounding areas of romania (ukraine, transnistria), perpetuating and growth in the israeli-palestinian armed conflict.
on the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic objectives relating to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls on the legality of residence of third-country nationals within romania, and proper application of distant measures and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.

tvr leadership activity report, rejected in the committees: stian tanase risks dismissal
parliament's culture committees on wednesday rejected an activity report by the governing board of the romanian television company for 2014.
to reject the report 17 lawmakers, one against the rejection (senator varujan vosganian) and one abstained.
the text of the report will be submitted to permanent offices.
they will decide next week.
at the next joint plenary, it will be debated.
" i think that in view of this situation it will be done relatively quickly, " said senate culture committee chairman georgica severin.
he added that " it was common sense " for the tvr's leadership to be present at the sitting, as no representative of the tvr leadership was present at the meeting of the culture committees.
it was common sense to the leadership of the tvr to be present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like this.
the invitation was to members like last night, with an approximating hour that we did not know either, but today, after the joint offices, i personally sent a fax to the leadership of the tvr inviting it.
i believe that when you are convened, you are a budgetary wage, paid from public taxes and you are convened for a joint committee meeting even if you do not like alive.
" because it is your service obligation, you are in an institution subordinate to parliament, " severin said after a meeting of parliament's joint committee.
he added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the on the basis of the negative opinion of budget committees.
debts we we saw how they continued, came up with the idea that this year it would have been up to date, but did not pay out from the historical ones.
" i remind you that it is not by my own fault or anyone else in these committees that that leisure was lost with banks and the tax, there are clear management problems, " severin added.
he added that after the activity report is rejected by the joint plenary, elections would follow for a new board of directors, and he would elect the institution's director-general.
i do not know who will be proposed for this post.
wonders will not be done.
what is important is to take political decisions in order for this institution to work.
i am not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there will be a genius who queue here and beat.
i hope that decide in parliament's plenary by their vote will choose the people who will head the tvr.
there must be people who know what is happening there, have experience and have a great deal of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
i do not know who will be, if you ask me what qualities they have to have - common sense in attitude towards employees because it is a malagate of petitions coming from employees, complaints, redundancies.
" when you get such complaints 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation that is a disaster, " the chairman of the senate culture committee ended.
although he did not appear at parliament, tvr president director-general stelian tanase sent a letter to chamber of deputies chairman valeriu zgonea calling for parliament to consider a series of measures that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexation of tv tax.
in the letter, stelian tanase calls, in addition to indexing the tv tax, for amendment and completion of hg 978 / 2003 on the public television service tax, with a view to updating the provisions at technological change to day, as well as for regulating the control procedure in the payment of tv tax and finding of offences and applying sanctions and penalties.
he also wants a provision to be issued to extend the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become srtv mandations for collecting tv tax, by involving anre in regulating this activity.
in his opinion, it is necessary to set a maximum ceiling of 5% of the fee from proceeds.
stelian tanase is calling for reduction in the vat rate on activities specific public television and the contribution to the cnc from 15% to 3%, as well as changes to law 41 / 1994, to the possibility of receiving budget / financing allocations to purchase licenses for major cultural and sports events -- the world football championship, the golden sky, eurovision.
he says srtv will default in the coming months as labour law obliges the employer to implement court rulings, even if they are not final, and wage rights are honoured as a priority over any other obligation.
the tvr administration has constantly made efforts to cut staff spending and tv production.
" this, trips and other cost-generating activities have been reduced, a number of trade contracts were renegotiated, and in late july tvr news was closed, " president tvr president's letter said.
tanks appreciate that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied through its own efforts alone.
" without the support of state institutions -- government, parliament, the presidency -- romanian television will sooner or later be unable to carry out its public mission any more, " the letter noted.
the leadership of the chamber of deputies decided to send the letter to the committee of culture.

ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander, irrational statements
hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto harshly condemned early wednesday, romanian prime minister victor ponta's words that political decision makers in hungary were " no better than those in syria, libya or other countries fleeing refugees. "
" yesterday, victor ponta lost self-control and, with his irrational statements, offends the whole hungary, " the hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
civilised european politicians do not say such uncontrolled slander.

barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will just show that in hungary, at the heart of europe, political decision makers better than those in syria, libya or other countries fleeing those refugees!
" i believe in solidarity, in sensible and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of european values -- what we see in recent days in hungary runs completely counter to precisely these goals and values! " the head of the romanian executive stressed.
earlier tuesday, hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto called " mere lies " romanian prime minister victor ponta's remarks on hungary's management of the refugee crisis, viewing those claims for a 21st century leader, according to mti.
the head of hungarian diplomacy also noted on tuesday that the romanian prime minister's " extremist and misleading remarks " concern the domestic political crisis in romania and made it clear that budapest expects an apology from the romanian side.
szijjarto referred to a statement by prime minister victor ponta monday.
what i have said and always say is that i am against xenophobic speeches the idea of close borders, like all those who come are terrorists, are nonsense by the middle ages and i am totally opposed to this approach.
if we can get more, we us get, the problem is our logistics ability to treat those people as people, not as it treat our hungarian neighbours, knocking and seriousness.
" that's i don't agree with, " the head of the romanian executive said at a press conference in targu-jiu.
also on tuesday, peter szijjarto announced that the government in budapest has decided to start preparations on the ground for expanding to romania the fence it builds on the border with serbia, to deal a possible change in the route used by migrants.
later, prime minister victor ponta said hungary's decision to raise a border fence nothing of the refugee problem and " brings hungary out of europe. "
what link exists between osama bin laden and the collapse of mecca cranes
saudi authorities announced that the saudi giant binladin group, belonging to osama bin laden's family, is " partly responsible " for the collapse of a slaughter at the great mosque in mecca on friday, which left 107 people dead.
according to an investigative committee, the company has not " comply with the safety rules, " the saudi news agency (spa) reported, the bbc reported.
company directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation is completed in the case.
the firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
the construction firm is owned by family of former al-qaeda terrorist network leader osama bin laden.
the company, founded by osama bin laden's father 80 years ago and is currently headed by the brother of former terrorist leader, bakr.
binladen group has been working on expanding large mosques for 4 years so that can host several pilgrims.
the accident occurred late friday during a storm, when a butcher, probably unbalanced by strong wind shelves, crashed on the eastern part of the roof of the big mosque roof in mecca.
as a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
how the hagah closed their breath of challenges closed
widely seen as romania's biggest footballer in history, gica hagi was labelled, after stepping out of his work as a weak coach who cannot be able to perform in the new post as well.
after unfortunate experiences with the national team, star or galatasaray, hagi took over the coaching role in the constanta future, the team he a year ago.
one year after taking over the team, the king demonstrated he is capable of turning a team struggling to save from downgrading to a top one.
thus, a year later, the future registered 16 victories, 11 stakes and 11 defeats with hagi coach.
the balance sheet is one of a top team on european cups.
things took an even better turn for the future this season, as the team finished second in the 1st league 19 points, one less than leader astra giurgiu.
the future also has the best attack in the 1 league, with 20 goals (on a par with astra), more than double than star.
on the other hand, even though it brought several experienced players to the team, hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and names such as ianis hagi or hodorogea have emerged recently in the start team.
the club's policy made the future a team to watch for teams abroad, so hagi sold 1.1.5m euros this summer -- ianis hagi (fiorentina - 1m euros) and alexandru mitrita (bari - 500 thousand euros).
along with steaua, the future is the only profitable league team, according to trade register data.
in the refugee crisis, romania has so far played as a small country.
it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
big countries come with solutions for the entire eu, says cristian ghinea, a member of the steering college of the romanian european policy centre.
in an interview with ziare.com, cristian ghinea said that europe cannot be transformed into a fortress and purely police means will not work in this crisis: " perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with. "
but there are masses that and we cannot return history.
migration is a reality that we must adapt as best as possible and adapt them to us.
in cristian ghinea's view, we are at an extremely emotional time where politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
once it has passed, europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules within the schengen area must be changed:' schengen is now like an animal created in another age and which was not adapted to the situation now'.
where are we in the refugee crisis after this jha council, in fact, solved nothing?
it is clear that ec president in agreement with donald tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
all the predictions that they would have had the necessary votes.
before the treaty of lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies jha any state could block any decision.
that is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
after lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the ec has the initiative, and the council approves it with the vote of 55% of states, that is, 16, which account for 65% of the eu population.
the calculations were saying that the votes existed.
but they did not want forward.
as this is a sensitive issue, rejection reactions have emerged in germany itself against chancellor merkel's opening policy and did not want it to appear in many countries as a'' eu is sending us migrants to its head'.
they have postponed it, but the problem remains because obviously, this wave is creating a huge problem for schengen governance and we will probably see great changes there in the coming period.
so have mandatory quotas not really been eliminated, but has the subject only been left alone?
yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement by frontex in managing external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are on schengen external border to the responsibility of community agencies.
greece's border with turkey is also germany's border with turkey de facto, and this wave of migrants has set the limits on the old schengen system.
perhaps the dublin principle will be abolished that migrants are the responsibility of the state to enter the first time, because it is unsustainable.
if greece falls, you cannot forever say that it is greece's job.
the problem is common.
precisely because the problem is common, is a resolution possible without a precise, perhaps even binding, mechanism for sharing effort?
nobody knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work if they are reached.
because a problem remains: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to romania or portugal, but sweden or germany?
i do not believe that they will take european states to take migrants high: you go to country x or to country y.
it will probably single filtering centres, greece or turkey, where asylum applications can be processed.
work is done on solutions like this.
but the problem does not have a simple solution.
they are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without any experience, like romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic trend.
the fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in turkey, lebanon, jordan, who are sitting in precarious camps and who have only just begun to leave for europe.
an estimate says that only 10% fit to leave, winter is difficult to the mediterranean, but we expect an perhaps even larger wave next year.
what do we do with their people?
my stition is that we will get used to this issue, we will no longer look at it so catastrophic from a media point of view.
about countries with less or greater experience.
does it seem to you to be any place where really managed to integrate large groups from an extra-european culture?
i look at the maghreb in france, turks in germany, they are still enclaves.
i would not radical statements.
of course, their integration is more difficult than other migration waves, but that does not mean that they do not integrate at all.
it has remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in france, germany, the united kingdom.
but purely police means will not work.
let us create fortress europe is illusory.
mechanisms for integration into european societies must be blamed.
mistakes here.
we need to be more demanding.
let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take values, to stop remaining on an foot in europe and one in their home country, bringing the rest of their family, including through marriages of convenience.
however, the imminent issue of these people from the long-term problem of their integration must be separated.
if others have failed in long-term integration it does not mean that we have to look at them how they are drowning in the mediterranean.
perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come.
and if there is an intervention in syria, which i do not think, does not mean that the country will recover overnight and you can take them back.
until solutions appear, we see fortress within europe.
borders have been closed, walls, border controls are being reintroduced into the schengen area.
is the european project at risk?
the european project as such not, the schengen area as built, yes.
it was built quite minimal and arranging the rules, so the pressure was too high on countries where they put these migrants for the first time these migrants.
that is, we are moving freely there, but everyone is with his problems.
in the face of such a wave it cannot be the case, because some countries are not coping.
when there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but not much is changing in the long term.
after the attacks in france, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the eu than we had last year.
it is a wave of public emotion that is installed in both senses.
and it is so unstable from one week to the next that you cannot make decisions on it.
we have a lot of talking, many rebellion statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virate.
and then you have the dramatic case of the child drowned in turkey and public opinion is emotional.
once public emotion, we will return to the reasons why we have created this area, this freedom of movement which is not only for people, but also for goods.
this is the real single european market.
and i do not think europeans will give up this movement principle.
that there will be other rules is something else.
schengen is now like an animal created in another age and which was not adapted to the situation today.
how has romania how has it played in this crisis so far?
as a small country, which believes that, if it shoits soke in the eyes and bredown its ears, the subject is disappearing.
faced with the reality of waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that this is not your problem as a small country.
that is what we have done, it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
you are not, not play at a large country level.
large countries come up with solutions for the whole of the eu, good or bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
as poland.
on the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of romanians for schengen will fall greatly.
president iohannis says it is good that we have not already entered.
so we are moving from disperair entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
there is, of course, a risk of whether romania and bulgaria enter schengen that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
this does not mean that it is a reason to stop entering schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
romania will be part of schengen, and schengen will exist, but transformed into the sense in which external borders will become joint responsibility, will be unique rules for the acceptance of migrants, single rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
the ukrainian president said that after russia moved its attention to syria to ukraine, no one died.
is there a link between the two seals, a russian game?
russia behaving frustrated power.
she believes that being a great power means incurring the americans and europeans.
from this point of view, yes, there is a link.
without the military and financial effort of the regime regime, the assad regime would probably have long collapsed.
and it was good to collapse before its main opponent was islamic.
a two years has been a fight between the assad regime and moderate secular and muslim militias by gulf and western countries.
then the islamic state and now we no longer know whether we want the assad regime to fall.
russia was able to complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
it creates a outbreak of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
but you are great power only if you also have solutions.
the game at off-side is just a strategy to gain time.
putin is probably awaiting bids to be made, put the butons to resolve the situation.
offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can one way or another issues he also creates.
but i disagree with theories who say that these people are driven by an invisible hand.
let us not see a little stronger than it is.
ec buton soon
millions of facebook users have become used to the " like " button, and now social networking representatives are preparing another opposite, " dislike. "
on tuesday, mark zuckerberg, a co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on his account that this button would be available soon, the new york times reported on blog.
zuckerberg made it clear that the " dislike " button would show a nuance of what a user feels rather than just an option.
however, his announcement raised the issue that facebook could become a less friendly place.
zuckerberg noted that he wants to avoid time when someone posts on his account an important life event, while someone else will give " dislike. "
the users of the network, who has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long been calling for the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
mark zuckerberg also said it is not very comfortable for people to give " like " current events such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of a death by a family member.
" you may not feel comfortable to give like that post, " the facebook representative noted.
the option of a new facebook button has not been well received by everyone.
" there is already enough enough on facebook and social networking networks, " atiq haneef of afghanistan commented on the new york times facebook website, where the article article was posted.
" i will give' dislike' dislike' button, " he added.
roger anderson, a atlanta microbiologist, claimed there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to differ on facebook.
debra aho williamson, social media analyst at emarketer, noted that it is hard to imagine that a single one button can send a complex range of negative emotions.
moreover, she says, the election campaign in america is approaching, " dislike " button would create a complete disaster.
only 70 refugees enter hungary within 24 hours
hungary accepted only 70 migrants, a hand of thousands of mass rants to its southern border with serbia on tuesday, government adviser gyorgy bakondi announced.
hungary declared a state of emergency later in the day in two counties along the serbian border due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing and announcing that it would build a fence on its border with romania, the dpa recalls.
the move drew sharp reaction from serbia.
just yesterday, they said that they would the border logo for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to apply for asylum.
" as you see, this is totally different, " said serbian minister for refugees aleksandar vulin.
before imposing new immigration legislation, a record 5,809 migrants entered hungary on sunday, police announced on monday.
more than 170,000 immigrants from the middle east and africa entered hungary from serbia in 2015.
many avoid being registered and are trying to reach the west, especially in germany.
" new " county council headquarters is typical.
two builders insolvency
the massive investments made here in recent years to move the institution stands down because they have been stopped several times.
two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
county council headquarters vasile alecsandri will end up tear down alone.
a year and a half after work on strengthening and reasfunctioning the building should have been completed, work has not reached half.
one final stage in the building's era was consumed in the past days, when the national dispute settlement council (cnsc) rejected a complaint with the firm that wanted to take over the contract to conduct the technical project for work that is still to be carried out.
the initial project was drafted by impex romcatel sa.
after the builder's insolvency entry and interruption of work, negotiating procedures began without the release of an announcement of impex romcatel, with the company to update the technical project and then a new tender to be held for works.
" however, the negotiations were not completed through a contract, the cj assessing the proposed form would have put the institution at a disadvantage, " razvan timofciuc, public relations within the cj, summed up.
the cj's decision to break direct negotiations was attacked in court by impex romcatel.
the emerging court sent the complaint to the cnsc, which rejected it as a tarside.
that does not mean, however, that the cj can start seeking another design.
impex romcatel has the opportunity to attack the cnsc's decision at the appeals court, only after a final ruling can it be considered finding another project.
thus, work on strengthening the building could resume next year at the earliest.
our intention is to restart work as soon as possible.
in principle, restoring the technical project should not take a long time, but we must reach a contract.
" we are waiting to see whether or not the cndecision will be attacked, " timofciuc said.
work on strengthening the former police headquarters of the quaestors began in 2011.
a first works contract was terminated in april 2012 after 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
the tender resumed, with the contract to moldovsa.
the firm, however, went into insolvency, and the contract terminated after 1.5 million lei payments were made.
work has been carried out so far at around 50%.
initially, consolidation, re-functionalisation and the building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.
" ready, everything say! " -- a statement that could criminalise the former head of the cadcadastre.
one of the employees involved in the scandalous dossier at the cadastre office signed an agreement to recognise facts for prison with delay.
his statements are most likely to criminalise other indictees, led by former head, narciza nedelcu.
an advisor from the iasi cadastre and real estate advertising (cpi) office accused by the dna in a corruption file recognised his fap.
an agreement on recognition of the facts signed by dumitru dasdascalu was registered yesterday at the iasi court, with judges setting to give a solution in the case on 29 september.
dumitru daniel dascalu was accused of false intellectual in his continued form and agreed to execute two years in delayed chiinău, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
as for dascalu's imputted facts, prosecutors made it clear that he, as an adviser to the cadastre office, along with other colleagues, " drew up in falsely several minutes of accepting ance, pri wanted service provision contracts in previous cheis by o.c.pneiasi company managers gauss company managers gauss srl, five srsc s, a a state.
recently, former office head narciza nedelcu, as well as other former or current ocmo employees, were tried on the dossier with the charges of services to the firms mentioned, although work has not been carried out.
pre exceeds 300,000 lei.
adventure in stone
in president frh's view, alexandru dedu, romania can only host a major handball competition in 2024, and preparing the women's national handball team to qualify for the olympic games costs a wealth.
romanian handball federation president alexandru dedu said during a meeting with the press yesterday that it is great pride that our country has three teams in the champions league groups.
as for romania's national women's handball team, " the main goal is to qualify for the rio olympics, but for this it has to go cauwives, first the world championship and second the pre-qualification tournament, " dedu also said.
we very much want to qualify for the olympic games.
these are fantastic requirements from the technical relay led by tomas ryde.
the staf, which will consist of seven or eight people.
he wants second coach, medic, two masers, gocoach, a physical preparation, head of delegation.
they asked us to obtain qualifications some things, namely materials for physical training, which we have never heard.
this is all to reach olympic games; and i will do everything to me to have them.
this is massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
but that is the way performance.
because we are currently in the stone age with preparation.
" the teams with which we are battling had these materials and had them for some time, " said dedu, who noted that he is trying to obtain the amounts needed to purchase these products from mts and cosr.
president frh also referred to the infrastructure in romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
we do not have the chamber in bucharest in bucharest.
it is an infrastructure problem and it is shameful to call a european gymnastics championship into question.
let us not forget that olympic neighbourhoods have been built in other corners of the world within two years.
before 1992, in the current barcelona olympic area, it was a landdump and it has now reached a milestone of beauty.
the same in london, where the organisation of the 2012 olympics was a success in terms of investment.
" in my view, in 2024 we can host a major competition, " du added.
he added that international handball bodies are willing to give romania major competition.
it is a priority for me to bring major handball handball competitions to romania.
mr gatu went in a civilised with a project, people gave their consent in principle, but it was made very quickly that the chamber would never be built.
i, too, had discussions with ehf, we told them that we wanted, that we were able to organise they also said they agreed and invite them to the first match in the new hall in bucharest and then we are discussing concretely.
" so we have all openness, and ehf and ihf, but we don't have infrastructure, " the frh official explained.
the former big handball player avoided assessing the chances of women's csm bucharest and hcm baia mare teams of reaching end four: " i asked all the coaches to be reserved in stitions, that if they do not return against them. "

14 million lions given to iasi's " st. spiridon " hospital to amending budget
what will be purchased with this important amount of money?
the' st. spiridon' hospital received around 14 million lei from the ministry of health, following the budget amendment.
the money the medical unit has received to use by the end of the year will be invested in modernisation and planning work for clinics, but also in medical and technical machinery for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograf computer with a new radiology apparatus with six trks used for surgical interventions, six properly equipped beds, oftalmogic micropurpose and other appliances needed to conduct the medical act.

hamas, laughghing by ratp controllers and a horant.
a tourist's patania any
a family of tourists from cluj came to iasi to visit him, but the trip ended in a bitter promise.
after my experience either, my wife do not want to calm in your city either.
without wishing, they have run into the erroneous information, feelings of rapt controllers and, bonus, a fine' like so called the law'.
husbands arrived in iasi several days ago, stayed in a hotel in the centre and called for tourist leaflants.
they also received a dreadful in which ratp trails were passed.
" armed " with these maps, husbands visited hamas.
but two days ago in copou, they wanted to reach palas mall.
as it was not ticket tones at the station near copou park, they relied on printed information on flying: that they can take sms ticket.
no one told them that this service no longer exists.
confident in horair, they climbed into a bus and tried to send sms after instructions on flying.
unfortunately for them, a team of missed controllers has emerged.
they said there has been no service for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
where can i know what has been written in the local press, and i coming a evening before i visited the city?
i spoke to the controllers, i explained the situation to them, they said they did not care, it is not their job.
the attitude has been very defiant.
they said that all they can do is swet a single fine instead of 2 (me and the wife).
" i paid, i did not want to shout my day at the gendarmerie and making statements there! " ovidiu tells.
in conclusion, the family was amended because of erroneous information and controllers who " applied the law in blood. "
that is not right, and i have made a complaint to ratp iasi to recover my money.
it is not about money, there is not much, but the point is that i felt deceived.
bad for rapists in vaslui.
they had accident, remained under preventive arrest
the trial of seven rapes from the vaslui has moved to the iasi court of appeals since yesterday.
emerging magistrates tried the first trial at an unpublic meeting in which the seven young people accused of mocking an 18-year-old called for a freedom.
before the court sitting really began, one of the emerging judges who assigned the file, viorel munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his court colleagues.
the magistrate activated until the summer of this year at the vaslui court, where he was president of nale station, who, on april 9th, admitted a challenge made by four of the indictees, with them under house arrest.
currently, the dossier is being tried by a complete that includes magistrates ical mytelu and thinking caming.
previously, in the dossier he also formulated a abstention and judge dan an ton, on the grounds that his daughter was in a relationship with competition with one of the rapists' lawyers.
the two judges decided that rapists at the vasship should remain under preventive arrest.
your helners will remain imprisoned for at least another 30 days, when the juorers re discuss the possibility of bringing them free.
the judge will take place at the iasi appeals court on 6 october.
before reaching to the iasi appeals court, the duba carrying rapists from vaslui was involved in an accident in the pacwishes neighbourhood, with the car entering iasi along the belt.
autoutilitara iveco with whom the seven rapists were transported hit a volks wagen car running from stradela sing, and the driver tried to stay on the left.
duba circulates from the pacs.
the car entered iasi here because prison administration employees preferred the route from vasans to iasi to walls, then on the ring road.
they thus shortened the road by a few kilometres.
immediately after the impact, the arrests' escort called another shipment to take over detainees.
shortly, a car was sent at the scene from the iasi maximum safety penitentiary, which took over seven detainees and transported them to the appeals court.
following the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
to transfer them to the other duba, the guards surrounded the back side of the mafia and and took to speed, two each.
" the incident was not reported to the police, because drivers of the make vehicles understood amicably regarding the damage to be paid, " said chief commissioner madalin taranu of the ipj.

romania is neither, nor will it be, prepared for what is next.
but europe?
i say this from the outset, clear and clear: the 7 000 refugees that romania should and should naturalise, romania are, in itself, an insignificant but huge number compared to the ability ability of the romanian state to manage such a project.
for romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by bucharest, a length of around 1,500 souls, far goes beyond the good intentions of solidarity with the european union expressed in recent months.
certainly, if those migrants really accept in our locations, the chances of integrating them quickly into romanian society are extraordinarily low.
i am convinced that they will be the first to lose patience.
paralysed by interloves and paralysed by an venal political class, the romanian state is proving to be mired in all areas.
failure to integrate gypsies is just a trivial example.
in addition, governments of any colour have not been able to absorb european funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, ensure decent healthcare, raise misery on the street, create honourably paid jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
why would refugees be established in another country from which they run?
but what causes a lot of wonder is particularly the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
we first come at the rebellion fatarity of the strong states of the eu, which are showing the utmost generosity when it comes to sharing misery with smaller countries.
then comes the cold-cold hypocrisy of romanians who, although they have millions of cattered relatives around the world, do not yet accept the other - on the other language, on different religion, blood.
perhaps for fear of not steal his national being.
after all, there is also hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for leaving, do not accept destination for exodus than germany or northern countries.
not all refugees are syrian, and there is no war in pakistan.
furthermore, the simplistic way in which the crisis is being considered can only be mocked.
the causes must be eliminated, some say and, squabbling strictly on the book of political correctness, they call for peace and investment for migrants' countries of origin.
but there is peace in romania and even enters, from time to time, some foreign capital into the national economy -- but this does not prevent tens of thousands of romanians from leaving their country every year.
why are they going?
in this crisis, the european union have been revealed that anchchilly construction, torn apart and overtaken by the situation.
we deplore the fact that romania is unable to invent a country project, but here the eu any plan for the future either.
and improvisation and threats are helping nothing.
what is the eu using, then, if the only advantage romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be called into question due to waves of refugees crossing borders as through cheese?
at one point, the war in syria will end.
not the migrants' crisis, however.
in the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc., will push millions of desperate migrants, from asia and particularly from africa, towards a better life.
with such politicians, romania is neither and will never be, prepared for what is next.

exclusively: a meeting that breaks your heart.
20 years received a courageous gift: biological parents
lost in hospital under unclear conditions, in the denial of the 1990s, when he had only two months of life, small, ill ill and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in italy, in the same years as adoption was vague regulated, a young girl, now a blhonest and beautiful beautiful, met met, met met the day before yesterday in iasi with biological parents in one of a a village.
the crina will take 20 years these days, and her adoptive parents in palermo thought of giving their beloved daughter a stunning and courageous present: a visit to romania, to iasi, in order to know their unclear past.
" de iasi newspaper, " which witnessed efforts to search for origin family after several extremely vague indices, witnessed these meetings that basically break your heart.
according to reporters, the emotions of the moment, statements by those involved, their reactions are downright moving and overwhelming.
the crine story begins 20 years ago in the rusty outstanding town, when it was only two months.
then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to hospital in the city.
disagreements began at home between parents and the mother had to go to the home.
he decided to keep the face and send me from home.
he stopped the face, and since then i have not known anything before.
" when i learned he was in hospital, it was too late, " remembers indualina alina a biological mother of the face.
crina was admitted with her grandmother at pascani's city hospital, and then the father of the coastal ca balcan left for work in the town of alexandria, teleorman county.
their lives were definitively.
they found crina at hospital
after his internalisation, the crine's father left for work in another village, and returned six months later.
meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the iasi hospital and the father, when he returned, no longer found it.
i think it was almost nine months since girl was in hospital.
" he have thought she abandoned, " a family grandson.
due to financial problems, the grandmother was unable to come with crine to iasi, and the girl remained in doctors' care.
because no one has taken more interested in the fate of the child all the time, she was taken over by the directorate-general for social assistance and protection of the iasi child, which then gave it to care for the investment centre in bucium.
there were years of abandonment and adoption were liily regulated today in romania.
at the bucium centre was found by italy's salvadore and his wife, a couple in palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
they fell in love on the blonduta crina and some time later it was to move permanently with them to italy.
little had already done almost two years as adoption formalities lasted.
when we saw crina, we felt it was us.
" as if my wife gave him his life, " says us smiling saving adore, the adoptive father, as caught in his slap in hand of the face.
in the country, parents of the crine, alina and costica continued the search separately, each where they could.
the father asked the authorities in request, but received no answer where his child could be.
police then told them that they may be dead, but in iasi parents found out what really happened to their face.
when i sought her here, they told me court that he was left for italy in palermo.
and the conditions to look for it did not had any longer.
we asked god to be good.
i thought about it in all the years passed, but there were not possibilities to blame, to find it.
" it's hard, " tears tells us in the crine's biological mother.
however, even if the years have passed, parents were not forgotten.
in italy, salvadore and wife explained to the girl where he comes from and that her past connects it with romania.
i was small when i.
i think we was five or six years old.
i reacted as a copy, i was curious curious.
" i wanted to know my parents in romania, " i confess delighted crina.
and her dream was to become a reality.
in march of this year, chief commissioner romica ichim, director of the regional centre for iasi prevention, evaluation and anti-drug selling, was contacted by an knowledge in italy, explaining to salvadore's desire to find the crine's biological family.
and the search started only from one name.
after our request from our partners in italy, we first steps.
we had received only one name, balcan costica, then locality, prasty.
shortly i did a job with the city hall there, and i could ask whether there was the name received by soil.
they then gave me some indications, just that the person found was not the one wanted.
" it took about a month to find the biological father of the face, " chief commissioner romica ichim explains.
in all, more than three months have taken authorities to find the coastal and alina, especially as everyone were living in elsewhere.
we began work somewhere in march, and in june-july completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
" then we established that a first meeting take place in september, " romica ichim added.
at the weekend, alina and costica first lost at the iasi hospital records 20 years ago.
the father, moved, was barely able to master his tears and his hands had relentlessly.
it is barely changing a few words with those around them.
a week before the meeting, he could not even sleep.
it was always emotional,.
" to see your child after so many years, it is something, " says an grandson, who came with the coast from his prasty.
crine's meeting with biological mother and brother
in talks with him, who is expected to study at a well-rated university in italy, costica balcan told him, among other things, that if he once wants to return to him in the village, come peacefully: he can give him some sheep, goats to find a boy from the village and shoot a household.
my mother is also moved, complains, and hardly believes this can happen to them.
i am very.
i did not think that could happen.
i saw this cases on television, i thought thought in these years, i hoped, but i did not think i could be the case.
these are very great emotions.
if he could forgive me.
i hope that we will visit each other in the future.
" i hope we can keep in touch, " he says with great tears in obraji alina, the crine's mother, as he holds a servclosely.
he is still hiding his tears in him, fortunately, because he will soon be faced with them after so kind of time.
on the other hand, the crina, which will be in just a few days' time, this month, 20, is trying to reassure themselves like an emotional child.
he does not know what to expect, but he has sketched on a vague idea of her biological parents.
i think there are young people, but now before the meeting are trying to gather their thoughts because he has a great deal to say, but nothing to reproach.
my parents are two mothers and two fathers.
but ultimately my parents who increased me.
it will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
" i hope to have a beautiful memory with them, because now there is so many things to say, " confess.
first family meeting
in the unification market, under the skies beginning of the autumn, the rusty family once again unites its destiny with their face in palermo.
crina is 20 years now ends high school, based on the italian school model, but can begin a new chapter with alina and costica, her biological parents.
it no longer divide borders or countries, but only one barrier: that of language.
fish which, with the help of an translator, an italian local owner at the centre of jaseasily passed.
those who managed to make this meeting possible say that this is the first event of its kind to be done, and that in future, if the opportunity arises, they will do so.
it is the first event of its kind to be organised, such an emotional cargo, and i am pleased to be a success.
we at the centre have various activities, and we are often associated as an institution that only deals with consumer people, drug addicts.
but we are trying to give something good back to society.
" if i am asked for such an evenfood, i will do so with great dear, " says smiling romica ichim, director of the regional centre for prevention, evaluation and nedrug counselling.
behind it, the balcan family, with crina in the middle, tells itself.
i am understandable: they have a lot to say to each other.
the arms truce yesterday in the psd.
everyone shoits soul
camps in the psd branch ended a ceasefire on the leg.
after successive rounds of talks from friday to sunday, the first being most tense, psd leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
pressed by the party's executive president, liviu dragnea, to present a united position, emerging social democrats will send him a whole list of potential candidates for party positions.
far from over, the internal war in the party seems to have taken a break to allow combatants to their soul.
dragnea did not ultimatum.
it has sent a very simple and very current message under the current conditions: try to find a solution not to jeopardise the party.
on 3 october, we have party elections.
all functions will be made available to those who want them.
" until then, we remain in the existing structure, " said acting mayor mihai chirlic.
the two days of talks at the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing certain was set.
fierce competition is expected in the october elections as president of the psd's county branch.
the short list of possible candidates for the top post in the party's emerging branch is state secretary maricel popa, senator florin constantconstantinescu, senator sorin lazar lazar, county adviser vasile catea and acting president of the county county council, victorel lupu.
to this could como schitu mayor mihai mihalache.
one option under consideration is also psd county councillors leader cristian stanciu should lupu no longer join the race, with party sources saying he is not interested in the post.
the only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations of recent days is that of the former branch leader, mayor gheorghe nichita.
the list of candidates is open.
under status, including applications can be submitted on election day, and would no anyone if it were to happen.
" what is important is that we remain united, and we will remain after october 3rd we have a new executive office, a new permanent county office and all new leadership structures, " she added.
until the internal elections are held, the leadership of the psd county branch will be secured by victorel lupu, a close to nichita and stanciu.
lupu, however, is on leave until 29 september, with the preparation of the elections effectively to be assured by the branch's executive secretary, county adviser mihail popescu, who in cold relations with the nichita camp.
contacted tele, cristian stanciu praised the talks in recent days that leading to " a partial consensus. "
there is broad willingness to maintain the balance and unity in the party.
a partial consensus has been reached to support a unitary team to deal with the judge.
" but on the other hand, there are several variants regarding intentions related to the iasi psd presidency candidacy, with the list remaining open, " stanciu commented.
an extraordinary judge refused vaslui rapists' file on the grounds of competition.
the seven young people in vaslui county convicted of rape come to the iasi court of appeals today.
vasswans sentenced to sentences between five years and eight months and eight years, and four months will today present their arguments about putting them at large after the underlying court, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence handed down.
the file was registered at the appeals court late last week, with magistrjudge dan anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
anton noted that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer bogdan luca, is his daughter's competition, lawyer dana anton.
luca defends silviu ovidiu burada, who received highest punishment in the dossier.
as judges motivated the ruling ruling
late last week, the magistrate at the vaslui judge who sentenced the seven young people motivated the sentence.
on the background, the judge talks about the defiant reaction of indictees, but also of those who supported him, saying that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
" the court notes that after the time judicial control is placed, the restrictive measure of freedom but not deprivation of freedom, under the impact of the attitude of indictees, their families and local supporters, was felt at local and national community level a strong sense of indignation that people accused of serious facts are being tried under a less restrictive extent, " it said in motivation ating the ship's case.
magistrates also dismantled the main defence of the seven indictees who, during the trial noted that the girl they raped would not be " the door of church. "
" the court notes that it lacks the moral quality of the injured person, which the indictees wanted highlight with the apparatus they formulated, as a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext, " the motivation noted.
corbyn, brexit and future of europe
to economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades cannot continue the same in the years to come.
until saturday, probably a little world knew in romania who jeremy corbyn was.
even today, after he became the new leader of the british labour party, many question to what extent it can affect the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
jeremy corbyn is the most radical clumsy leader of post-war labour.
marxist said, anti-monarchist (once asked tony blair, the then prime minister to pull the royal family out of buckingam palace), a feroce anti-american and sympathiser of vladimir putin (he was otherwise regularly invited to comment comment on political developments by the television channel " russia today "), and terrorist movements hizbollah and hamas, he wants to give up nuclear and
for corbyn, who then saw the murder of osama bin laden a real tragedy, the isis was almost preferable to the united states.
based on the model of all populist demagogues, corbyn, of course, has miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
things of the kind he and tsipras said and promised in greece until it gave the chest with the real world and economic legities.
the economic programme of the new labour leader provides, among other things, for massive renationalisation and money to be printed as a solution for financing projects for development and covering very generous social benefits.
of course, some might wonder why the solution for printing money is not unanimously adopted around the globe, we would then have global overall prosperity! but who would prevent itself from such details.
of course, we can charge bankers to blood, you are becoming some kind of service enemies of the left, but as far has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in ecuador or venezuela, but also in france, at the beginning of mitterand and hollande's mandates.
the additional sums are quickly swallowed by generous, uncover promises made by populist demagogues.
as margaret thatcher rightly pointed out,' the problem of socialism is that others' money ends at some point'.
few give jeremy corbyn real chance ever reach prime minister.
in the early 1980s, another radical left-wing leader, michael surroi, who was not as belief anyway as the fresh party leader, failed lamentably in the elections.
and then there is still a workers' class in britain in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured sense.
and trade unions were sensitive more influential than they are now.
under the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant throughout the entire labour force, and extensive automations have made a massive need for highly qualified labour, corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
however, even from the opposition opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
in its latest financial times, he believes corbyn's election increases the chances of brexit, namely britain leaving the eu.
the new labour leader has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the union.
in the eyes of the radical left, brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed austerity on the poor.
when you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis rocking the eu's foundations reach an explosive mix.
and not just for britain.
but if the british decide following the referendum, to be held by 2017, to leave the union loss of symbolic capital for the entire european project and the deep shortcomings created within it by the euro crisis, and now that of refugees, between north and south, between east and west, leave room for in the most worrying scenarios.
all the more so because for a whole series of member states, london was an balance at the franco-german axis (in which berlin increasingly becoming the dominant actor).
true, british business, city, are strong lawyers of the country remains in the eu.
however, today's europe is no longer the one of the past.
there are many resentment, which is growing in intensity in these very weeks.
the problem is that brussels, i had a stra just recently in jean cluj de junker's speech, increasingly tends to take major decisions over head of the vast majority of member states consulting only a few european powers, mainly germany.
and this is as electoral support for the anti-system, anti-immigration formations, which are at the same time and eurosceptic is growing dramatically throughout the continent.
in other words, the negatively charged emotional climate has reached higher than ever in the past.
hence the conclusion that the financial times draws when assessing chances.
the pro-eu option is based on a cold calculation national interest.
if voters make the cerebral decision, then britain will remain in the eu.
but corbyn's victory reminds us of the strength of emotion in current politics.
eastern europe can, however, be significantly affected by such major developments.
especially if, as expected, we see greater integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and on the outskirts of interest and in the decision-making process in europe.
corbyn, tsipras and syriza in greece, podemos in spain, even bernie sanders in the united states are fuelling their populist rhetoric from frustrations accumulated in osociental societies.
due to economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades, generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the coming years to come.
under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the euro area - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that have taken into account only integrationist political ambitions, not the capacity and availability of the peoples and governments of europe to respond to such challenges, turbulence on the continent, internal tensions in the eu will increase in intensity and may major affect romania's situation.
and it is difficult to rule out something in terms of possible scenarios.
the question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
constantin brancusi, the taran god.
rockefeller:' how can you?'
brancusi: " take the workshop! "
the great sculptor had a great dream: be someone, get famous, hear about it all over the world.
behind his reputation, however, there is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories, recipes for success in life are delivered to us.
that something also has a name.
it is called' truda'.
what write about constantin brancusi?
what is still to be said, in fact?
his figure appeared on banknotes.
and recently, a known bank in romania has employed an actor to play him in a advertising client.
brancusi produces and supplies money nearly 60 years after he is no longer with us.
in romania, there are hundreds of streets and boevards bearing his name.
in fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
and when he stands out of odrasla, the following instructions are heard:' we go to the park to brancusi'.
the country is its statues.
there are few romanian figures whose works are known by the world, from children to the elderly.
brancusi's capacity is a huge one.
the communists failed to extirate from romania's memory and culture.
his quotations today today ple the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of like like and share shares.
and, then, again, what would still be to be said, to writing about this man?
viewed from the lot of books and articles trying to reconstitute its destiny, brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
you know, there are those people who tell you that, if you did not have the luck to born in any large city and in a family how well, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
and perhaps it would be a key here.
perhaps this is where the forthcoming text should start from.
with a sentence, however detestable they are.
look at the success stories, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and television.
look carefully at this man's figure.
do you want to know how to succeed in life, how, today, by he has heard a whole world?
it is simple.
he has worked all life to be someone.
that is what it did.
constantin brancusi is born on 19 february 1876 in hobita, a small village of fish sani county, gorj county, at the carpathian poets.
he is the fifth child of nicolae brancusi.
although he came from a wealthy peasant family, brancusi leads a modest life, but one of which he would reap the benchmarks that will guide his late artistic vision.
remembering childhood and places where he grew up, the artist would confess at a meeting with petre tutea in paris in 1933: " then life was beautiful and harmonious. "
for millennia, people followed a patriarchal life happily.
everything moved from one season to another.
and do you know why things have changed?
the great city's civilisation has reached us.
brancusi's childhood, however, was far from idyllic.
one of the moments occurred in these first years of life is highly revealing of the combination of purity and violence that characterised his future sculptor years spent in their home town.
the timing is being reproduced during the work " cheese, a biography, " by alexandru buican.
in 1879, constantin brancusi was 3.
in the autumn of that year, when tuica " at an " was done, watching those who taste the liquid to see if the process is going properly, cheese is catching a moment of general irattention.
it fills its bail with tuica and drink on breath.
it falls in the almost instantaneously sleep.
the first people see only a few minutes later.
my mother panic, then in hysteria, believing his son died.
late in the evening, when father radu returns alive accompanied by grekeys, he sees from away the desperate signs of those who wait very much for him at his mouth.
the party immediately turns into jale.
the father is already thinking of burying the patient.
however, someone finds it is good to call on baba brandusa, domons and cheese cheese servvers.
cheese checks children's breath, then puts them under horse balega of horse nl gathered from the eve.
child child.
the world.
while the boy is left to sleep his bey, his joy, spending with laurels continues with even more force.
the next day father and son meet through livada.
radu brancusi puts constantin to gather some nuances and bring them.
the father puts his child head down and, with the boy's nueuds, he bats him to remember.
and while the uststth of the bps, small cheese has the revelation that the world can also be seen from another perspective and that the around things can emerge overturned.
in particular the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him ask itself, as he had to recognise in old age, if not the astrhimself participates in his disorder.
has the sun have been the sun as disturbed as his father by what had happened to him?
currently, the city is not working.
an mp calls on politicians to remember those who voted.
independent deputy viorel blajut called on the psd and the pnl to stop fighting and return their agenda to the electorate.
what we are now seeing on our political scene is a great divide and so.
we have seen nothing of the usl projects in 2012 that continue.
neither the highway nor a regional emergency hospital, see only how politicians dispute their possible sites according to real estate interests.
let us leave a little aside politics, gather and speak.
currently, the city is not working.
" if you are busy with the internal war, you don't have time left for those who elected you, " blajut said.
he assessed the current political class disappointed emerging voters, with the result of a very low turnout in the upcoming local elections, around the 30 per cent figure, representing the parties' faithess voters.
the deputy also believes voters will also turn to traditional parties, expressing reservation for new political initiatives, such as the " for iasi " party to be launched today.
local parties have a very little chance and will only break the electorate of the right, not the psd.
such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually right.
" the right goes further, which is not good for anyone, not for the psd, " blajut said.
he made it clear that he is not interested in candidacy in the upcoming local elections, denying rumours of his intention to join the mayoral race.
i have also said that i do not want to run for any local office.
i am also considering whether to continue as a member in the next term of office as well.
i tried to call for the unit for iasi and the cholholding discussions, with the other parliamentarians, and i have been accused of wanting to give my image.
i do not want, but we cannot go like this.
" if people voted for us, it does not mean they are fools to vote longer if they see nothing, " said blajut, who assessed that the main reason why voters is no longer interested in politics is the alps' hypocrisy.
a colleague from tatarasi said he does not get his money and go by bus.
let us not.
there is no little money.
sometimes i am ashamed to raise the money from ca.
at the end of the term of office, i will make a report with everything i have spent, apart from cabinet employees' salaries of cabinet and its maintenance.
i happened to rise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all transport accounts, accommodation and others.
" tell an mp that he doesn't get his money is clean hypocrisy, " blajly ended.
