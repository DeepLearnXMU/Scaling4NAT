un chief says no military solutions in syria
secretary-general ban ki-moon says his response to russian military support for syria is that " there is no military solution " to the nearly five year-conflict, and more weapons would only exacerbate violence and suffering of millions of people.
the un chief again called on all sides, including the divided un security council to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
ban said at a conference wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers from five five countries permanently present in the council -- the us, russia, china, england and france -- on the general assembly ministerial session to discuss syria.
ban voiced regret that divisions in the council, and between syrian syrian people the regional powers " have made this situation unresolved. "
ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach agreement on iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in syria.
8 polls showing donald trump has real chances
some have tried to label it as a " lip-flop " politician.
others called him a joke.
and others wait for implosion.
but regardless of how some republican ans are trying to remove donald trump p from poll peak, it has not worked (yet).
ten of the last 11 national polls showed that donald trump leads with a two-digdig, and some are starting to seriously question what that means for the chances of appointment of real estate mogul.
of course, it is still premature.
none of this says the trump will win the race for nominof the republicans.
pundits shows that during the same period in 2011, rick rick perry took place to herman cain in the polls but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
and the reasons it would fight hard in the general elections are numerous.
but outsidgroups such as jeb bush's super cap and conservative conservative group club for growth acknowledge trump's power and are beginning to support it with money.
we still present to you some figures in recent polls that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just something passing passing:
the figures showing support for the trump returned to 180 degrees.
even before donald trump announced his candidacy in mid-june, a poll conducted by the university of monmouth shows that only two out of 10 republicans had a positive view of the property mogul.
by mid-july, the percentage has climbed to 40%.
in early august, it was 52.
currently, six out of 10 republicans have a favorfavourable view of donald trump.
about three out of 10 say they think very negative.
these figures remain.
a poll conducted last week by quinnipiac in iowa concluded that 60% of the regional republicans have a favourable view of the trump.
two-thirds of gop voters would be happy if trump won the race for the nomination.
in a poll last week by cnn / orc, 67% of the republicans said they were " excited " or " satisfied " if the trump won the race for the nomination.
only two out of 10 say they would be " upset " if trumtrump won nominnomination race.
only ben carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as trump (43% says he was " enthusiastic " about 40 per cent saying the same about trump).
closest closest to enthusiasm?
marco rubio, with just 21%.
on the other hand, 47% of republican voters say they are " dissatisfied " or " upset " if fron@-@ ed jeb bush wins the nomination race.
most republicans do not consider trump's temperament a problem.
although donald trump has been strong criticised for insults and his bombastic style, 52% of republican voters nationwide cally that the real estate mogul has the right temperto for president, according to a poll conducted by abc news / washington post on monday.
we are finding the same figures in the state of iowa, where 52% of the republicbelieve the trump has the right personality to be leader, according to a poll, conducted last week by quinnipiac.
however, 44% believe it does not have the necessary personality to act effectively and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperature has no place at the white house, according to abc / post.
republican voters are used to the idea.
when taking the attitude of intellectuals, republican voters consider the trump authentic.
according to a poll last week by cnn / orc, as question who has the most likely of win the race for gop, four out of 10 said the trump.
the situation has changed since late july, when four four out of 10 bet ed jeb bush.
full information: in the past, gop voters have not read the future very well.
during the same period of last elections, four of 10 10 republicans rick perperry in race for nomination nomination, just 28% for mitt romney.
however, these figures show that the majority of gop voters consider trump's campaign plausible.
even though its republicans fent to another candidate; the trump still tops the lead of all.
some say the divided situation is likely to aid trump's victory, while support for trump splsplit into more than dozen candidates.
but a poll in early september by the university of monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical event a co-between the trump and most of the other republican candidates, almost always always trump will benefit given majority support.
trump is ils 13 points from carly fiorina, 14 points from marco rubio, 15 points of walker, 19 points from jeb bush and, finally, 33 points each in row line paul, john kasich and chris christie.
it is close to par with ted cruz.
is the only candidate defeating him?
ben carson would beat the businessman 19 points points in a one to one hypothetical confrontation.
most donald trump p supporters say they have been decided.
a new poll on tuesday by cbs / nyt showed that more than half of voters who support the trump say they are not changing their ballot away.
obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and nobody can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say it leaves the loophole open to change its option.
however, trump's most important adversary is currently neurosurgeon ben carson, but it is twice as likely that voters who say they have decided to vote for trump.
six out of 10 republicans say i agree with trump on the issue of immigration.
since donald trump named immigrants from mexico " raprapists " in his opening speech on his campaign two months ago, immigration has been the focus in the campaign for 2016.
some are concerned that trumtrump bombomtic style will lead to a split between leading hispanic voters the republican party, and will harm efforts at rebranding.
but according to a poll conducted monday by abc / post, six out of 10 republicans say they agree with trump on the issue of immigration.
so, it seems that as long as immigration issue remains on the spotlight, so will be doland trump.
frustration with the authorities reaches new pm.
donald trump and ben carson are now backed by nearly half of the republican voters, largely because of their status as outsent.
according to the poll conducted monday by abc / post, six of 10 republicrepublicsay they preprefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone has government experience.
people are also angry with washington.
a poll conducted two weeks ago in iowa by des moines register / bloomberg shows three out of four republicans in owoware frustrated with the performance of the republican in the congress, with 54% declaring were " unhappy " " while 21% " nervous at cules. "
jeremy corbyn makes debut at prime minister's questions
since his election, the start of mr corbyn in pmqs has been long long awaited.
the new leader of the labour party, jeremy corbyn, will make his debut at first minister's questions later, facing david cameron for the first time.
mr corbyn will ask the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance is likely to be closely analysed by the media and labour parliamentarians.
in his weekly appearances, he called for " less theatre and more deeds. "
he also said he could give up several participments and cein them to his colleagues.
the confrontation will be the first parliamentary test of mr corbyn the leadership, coming after naming a' phhost cabinet' and after speech he made at the annual tuc congress tuesday.
meanwhile, the labour party's's decision to keep silent at the national anthem's news at a service he held tuesday on the 75th 75th anniversary of the battle of england has drawn criticism from some conservative lawmakers and made the front headlines.
corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem draws attention
a spokesman for mr corbyn said that he' kept respectfully fully'' and recognised' the heroism of british air forces in the battle of england'.
but a member of mr corbyn's phhost cabinet, owen smith, said for the two's newsnight show broadcast by the bbc that it would have advised the labour leader to singout the national anthem' regardless of' his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
around a dozen ministers in the fanhost cabinet refused to be part of mr corbyn's leading team, arguing by differences of opinion on the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a one-sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
bbc political correspondent robin brant says the differences in politics " poate " in the labour party after mr corbyn was appointed to his position towards the eu and the benefit limit.
mr corbyn said at the tuc conference that the labour party would make changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limiting it.
a few hours later, mr smith, minister for labour and pensions, said that the party' is very clear' in exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the' cap' level from gbp 26.000 to gbp 23.000.
mr corbyn will be the fifth labour leader david david cameron in the gallery in the last decade since taking office over the conservative party.
the labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says that he has' from foreign sources' ideas for questions to put to mr cameron and has received more than 30 000 suggestions.
mp islislington north said pmqs involves too high a level of confrontation, and will refrain from shocks and attacks, committing instead to focus instead on serious issues such such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
mr corbyn said that angela eagle, the minister for finance, will be up his seat in pmqs when he is unable to attend - for example when mr cameron is moving abroad.
he also expressed the idea he would allow allow colleagues to speak occasionally, saying he approached the president of the chamber of deputies john bercow to discuss the issue.
in 2005, when he took over, mr cameron said that he wanted to give up' punch and judy' political style often often associated with pmqs, but admitted a few years later that he failed to make succeed in doing action.
since its first transmission in 1990, pmqs was seen as a key barometer of rationing of a leader, way he leads the house of deputies, and of its position among my fellow members, although critics say it has become a caricature, and that it in a need of thorough reform.

jd sports chief says higher wages could harm enlargement
jd sports president peter cowgill says an increase in the minimum wage in the uk could mean " greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers. "

thanasi kokkinakis by tennis australia steve healy
thanasi kokkinakis would merit praise and not criticism for his behaviour.
thanasi kokkinakis was the collateral victim in the " storm " created around his friend, nick kyrgios, and his behaviour rather deserves words of praise praise and rather not criticise, in the opinion of president tennis australia, steve healy.
kokkinakis, the youngest part of the talented duoften called " special ks, " was unplplantly gged in the light of the elispotlight by the scandalous derailding that kyrkyrgios had stan stan wawrinka at the montreal masters tournament.
in a hard-qualimatch played shortly after, in five years, the referee of chair had to intervene twice to disde kokkinakis and his adver@-@ challengchallenger rryan harrison,, after which harrison said said, " wawrinka would have supposed to have put him his earth on kyrkyrkyrgios.
although it was last seen making a dust rocket after having a blle crwke and missed a possible us open tournament, angered richard gasquet, kokkinakis has been vigorously defended by healy.
the teener is currently in glasgow, where he vies with sam groth for second individual individual, after bernard tomic in the davis cup semifinal against england.
" one thing i feel strong is that in my opinion thanasi has been attracted a bit into conflict, " said healy.
the fact is that he broke a rocket when he lost because of accusing crampe in us, but it is not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration over itself, and i know of thanasi well enough enough to know that he would not be proud of it.
but let us be serious, it has been well managed in rather provocative situations in us with harrison and so on, and i think it deserves a lot of trust.
it has a great team, it has a great family together and i think it has been treated unfairly.
he is a very mature year-old old, working hard and integrated into the team, has had no conflict with the other players, he is very respected in the west, he is very training, is in an excellent form, he is very balanced and very balanced and mature young, and i believe that he is worthy to be tried on trial solely on the basis of his qualities and defects.
healy also supported the decision not to take into account kyrgios for the key landmark match that begins friday, and described the " joint decision " as the most appropriate appropriate for all, but supported the return of the player from canbernative from canberra in the long term.
" first of all we want the team to focus entirely on the game game and not to think at all about the controversy around [kyrgios], " healy said.
and i think nick moved very quickly, as people like federer and murray, he maturing through public and made some terrible mistakes and deserves worth criticism, but we are trying to support him, trying to help him to understand the consequences of his facts, and i believe that he needs a time he is in attention to reflect, good for the team and for him.
2016 elections: hillary clinton's advantage to bernie sanders has shrunk by half in the national polls
former secretary of state hillary clinton still has a two-figure lead in the democratic race for national candidacy, but senator bernie sanders wins ground.
clinton is now backed by 47% of the democratic voters (down from 58%), while sanders is second, 27% (in the up to 17%).
vice-president joe biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is been backed by 15% of democratic voters.
at least five months before the start of the elections, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say they have been decided on the candidate to back.
but clinton's supporters are stronger in their election than supporters of other candidates.
compared to a poll conducted by cbs news last month, clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while sanders won a few per cent.
clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has diminished.
support for men has been considerably, and sanders is only just 5 points.
clinton's advantage among the democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and on in par with sanders.
however, clinton is still at the lead among older voters.
last month, clinton was outside sanders, a two-dig, among among liberals but sanders now has a slight 5-point advantage in this group.
about half of democratic voters at the national level say they would enthusically support clinton had she elected to run on behalf of the party.
a quarter would support it somewhat reserved, and an additional 15% would support it just because they represents the party.
six per cent would not support it.
perhaps unsurprising, the likelihood that clinton's current supporters will be excited about her election is high.
opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently currently support clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
while 48% of democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support clinton, the number of republican voters who say the same thing about first-ranked, donald trump (35%) is lower.
when clinton's supporters asked an open question about why she would like her a race, the majority answer is that she has proper experience (16%), followed by the time has now come for a woman to be president (13%) and she is the best candidate for this post (10%).
clinton's supporters also mention her association with bill clinton (9%).
the agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
given that the vice-president considers a possible candidacy for the presidency, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third of i think they should not run.
in the question of the second option for the party representative, democratic voters call a majority call biden.
of clinton's supporters, more than half say biden would be the second possible option, ahead of sanders.
if biden decides not to run in the democratic party race, hillary clinton's advantage to sanders grows,, from 20 points with biden to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of democratic voters see clinton as the best likely of winning the general elections; but the figures have dropped from 78% last month.
biden is second, however, the percentage he is most eligible has increased.
however, when asked what is the most important for an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer issues rather than eligibility.
as last month, no democratic or possible candidate candidates is considered by these voters as unacceptable to represent the party in the presidential race.
democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well on several key features towards their party's primary voters.
most majority voters see clinton, sanders ers and biden integrated and reliable and with solid qualities of leaders.
biden is best seen of all three three in terms of integrity, while clinton's strength is the leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not believe that h. clinton is integrated and trust, twice as many as say so about sanders (15%), but 27% do have no opinion on it.
the democratic voters generally believe that the three, clinton, sanders and biden, have the same ideologies as they.
on all of this, about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have an opinion of sanders.
as questions persist over the use use of a personal email address and server by hillary clinton when she was state secretary, the majority of democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject subject and say say she did not affect their overall opinion on the candidate.
but things are quite different among the us public.
half of the americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only a third of us are satisfied.
public opinion was divided on the topic in march, shortly after the issue came to light.
most americans say the controversy over e-ail has not affected their opinion about clinton, although 36% say they changed changed mind in a negative sense.
mainly, the republicans, more than six of 10, say they have changed their mind on clinton in a negative sense.
although the democratic voters see clinton integrate and trust, this continues to pose her problems among her voters generally: only 32% see it integrate and trusted, 8% less than last month, and 15% less than in may.
62% of voters do not consider it integrated and reliable.
at the same time, 55% of voters at home do not view the trumpet for integration and trustworthy.
however, both clinton and trump have white ches on leadership.
of the six surveyed candidates, biden, carson and bush are the first in terms of integrity.
the number of those considering sanders integrintegris larger than those who disagree, as with carson, many do not think about it.
the margin of error for the ple ple 351 51 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
five members of the therhood charged for murdering the student in 1 of baruch faculty
nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the pocono in pensylvania mountains, five people were charged with murder.
members of the pi psi brotherhood of the baruch faculty in new york brutattacked chun " michael " deng during an initiation ritual in september 2013 and then postponed to take him to hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police.
official sources say the victim was tied in the eye, was put blamed with a 142kg backbackbag full of sandsand and has been umashed repeatedly as he tried to head for a target on a frozen land.
mr deng has accused headpain and lost his knowledge.
members of the pi delta psi therhood did not call the emergency number after it fafaded and claim he had waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.
but they found the time needed to change deng's clothes, seek google's symptoms and contact andy meng, the national president of the brotherhood, to ask for his advice, police chief chris wagner said at a press conference.
" at this moment, members have started hiding their personal goods and put practically the sake of the brother ahead of michael deng's good, " wagner said.
he could not be suscitated and died the second day morning.
according to an autopsy report, deng suffered repeated tramas at his head, trunes and apps.
" too many families were devastated by the ritues of brothers, in 1970 at least one student lost his every year due to the ritues, " douglas fierberg, lawyer deng's family, said in a statement.
their brothers and their members must be held accountable and this step taken by the authorities is important.
the grand jury of the monroe district has recommended that the top five members be charged with three-degree murder.
thirty-two brothers of the brotherhood, including mr meng, will also be charged for the ulj and complicity in the murder.
" we want to hold accountable not only the people involved but, if there is an organisation that has authorised the brotherhood, officially or informofficially, we will hold it to account as well, " wagner said at a press conference tuesday.
the baruch faculty banned brotherhood, while the national brotherhood withdrew affiliation with local representatives.
that will happen when interest rates increases in federal reserve increases
the interest rate will increase and the bull (growing market) market will collapse, profitability for bonds will grow and the economy enters into recession.
that is we know.
what we do not know is how long it will happen and long it will last.
in the economy, history offers little clues of time.
after the first increase in the interest rate, recession recession in just 11 months and it took 86 months.
the aggressiveness of the federal reserve to raise interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
that is why the officials of the us central bank have emphasised so strongly that investors should not focus on the time are starting to increase the interest rate but on the trajories of the time needed for normalisation.
indeed, there are many variables at stake.
but in the end, market players may see that all the excitr about the higher interest rate has been blown.
" the first increase in interest rate decided by the edf after the financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the era of " cheap money, " julian jessop, the chief economist at capital economics, said in a note to the customers.
on the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual tracking of us interest rates to more normal levels but still low to be the seismic shock that everyone all seem to be afraid.
but it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
we are still putting forward out how several sectors of the economy could react, drawing on historical trends:
given the situation that the market has been facing in recent months, the ation of an increase in interest rate may volatile things for a time.
but at the rise, the impact is not that dramatic.
" it seems there is a tendency for the return of capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which perhaps again reflects the breakdown in the monetary policy, " deutsche bank analysts have said in a recent study on to what to happen after the edf increases.
specifically, over the last 35 years the market has risen sharply - around 14 per cent - moving towards interest increase, quite invariable over 250 days after (the average end of 2.6%), after which is returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to recent analysis by the chief nuveen asset management.
deutsche said the impact on shares tend to become pronounced later during the interest-growth cycle, and benefits are beginning to decline.
the recession is a reality of economic life, but raising the interest rate often contributes to it.
in the current situation, the edf is facing some conditions that have not existed before and which could speed up a recession.
specifically, gross domestic product will will come to its historic minimum point for an increase in the edf interest rate.
according to deutsche bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal gdp was less than 4.5%.
even though in the second quarter of 2015 it was at 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to edf atlanta.
raising the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question " whether it is different this time, " said deutsche.
market players have prepared earlier this year for a decision to increase from the edf, with all eyes eyes for this week this week's federal open market commission, which ends on thursday.
although many strategists and economists believe that fomc may approve an increase in interest rates during this meeting, fixed-term transactions are likely of only 25%.
" in our study conducted after 1950, all interest interest rate cycles to far have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with the gdp eclipliping wheaks prior to the recession very quickly after the recovery began, " the report said.
on the contrary, this has been a bizarward slow recovery after the worst recession in the period period.
the current cycle is by far the longest-awaited by the edf since the end of the last recession; the record stood been 35 months, and it has reached 74 months and continues.
fixed income has also been volatile as the market expects an increase in the interest rate and the printing tern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
the main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case actions when the edf changes policy.
in the case of bonds, it benefits seem to be are the direction as there is the first growth / decrease in the cycle.
at the end of the cycle of increasing the interest rate, profitability profitability of is falling immediately, " deutsche said.
charles schwab strategies are of the opinion that these interest rate increases will help bring the profitability between short-term - and long-term bonds closer, penising the pace.
high-bond bonds are doing better in such an environment, although " we are still wary of forcing the profitability, " said in kathy jones, a fixed fixed income analyst, in schwab.
interestingly, jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of the edf policy.
" in addition to the power of the dollar and lowering estimated inflation, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy, " jones wrote.
short-term interest rates have increased, the pace of profitability is fairer, the spread of the average credit interest interest rate has dened and volatility has increased - all the market characteristics when the edf tightens tens politics.
overall, companies operating mostly in the us will to benefit from an interest rate increase, and local products will become more attractive.
the heavily indebted multinationals will suffer because the rise of the dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market area, and their debt will be more expensive.
" history shows that " quality' stocks ttend to be more profitable in the three months after an initial increase in the interest rate, " the analyst goldman sachs said in a report to customers.
strong balance sheshefirms exceeded those on a poor balance after each of the interest rates rate 1994, 1999 and 2004, by an average of 5 percentage points.
companies with high receipts capital capital with stocks with low volatility have also exceeded similar low-quality companies, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
debt will become an important issue.
companies with a large proportion of flodebt have the most to lose, goldman says.
consumers will also benefit from the dollar's rise.
those who economise could also benefit, although the experts not agree on how quickly this will happen.
bbc radio 3 is a copy after classic fm classic, says mp andrew bingham
conservative mp andrew bingham blcriticised radio for " foping "
he says it is more similar to trade opponent
he also took bbc music awards eye as plioning the brits awards
colleague damien collins attacked the voice, saying it show is not original either
bbc radio 3 is " turning into " classic fm, said a senior lawmaker, putting pressure on post to prove he is doing something commercial stations are not doing.
the conservative mep andrew bingham also told the bbc heads that the public radio' foishish' and is more resembles the commercial opponent.
" i have the impression that radio 3 " prostis' -- although i do not like using the word -- but i have the impression it is turning into fm classics, " he said.
it also watched the bbc music awards, which began last december.
the bbc music awards, launched last year, appears be brits by another name.
so, if you try to do something different -- these are the two examples that come to mind that only dupliccopy what is already exists on the market, " mr bingham said.
the bbc managing general has denied the accusations, saying the bbc radio 3 is well of its commercial challengsary about live music and public education.
i will not know anywhere about the classical music out from radio 3.
and his commitment to live and production music has no rival.
" furthermore, i think it is also important important radio 3 3 commitment to undiscover new music and the allocation of new plays, " he said.
in the first part of this year, bbc radio 3 editor alan davey said he must do more to attract an audience from the previous period because the british have less knowledge about classical music.
but radio 3 was not the only element under the bbc logo criticised at a meeting of the committee on culture, media media and sports for allegedly going in the footsteps of its trade rivals.
conservative mep damien collins attacked the voice - the bbc's bought talent show from the dutch producer talpa media for about gbp 22 million.
do you understand why there is often talk show talk because it is not original and does not distinguish itself by anything?
lord hall has insisted that the bbc1 web show -- with the paloma faith and boy george in the juriu -- be conducted " in a specific bbc manner. "
he added that he wants the corporation " to find golden eggs in its own own grawheat " next time it launches a entertainment show.
however, he refused to ban in future the taking over new seasons in the voice, or to spend money to licenses on other entertainment formats.

sad sad memory preserved of sacholy place, where only a few days ago, a crof construction collapsed through the tavy of the mosque, falling on believers.
the bodies were released for the funeral after the saudi king penalised the construction group of the bin laden family for the disaster, also resulted in 394 injured.
at the ceremony on the street, hundreds of muslims gathered to bury 29 29 victims killed by a crcranes at the great mosque in mecca.
the victims included four children's father, qasim akram, from bolton, great manchester, his first pilgrimage when the macaraucollapsed.
mr akram is in the great mosque with his parents before the start of the hajj pilgriinge annually.
saudi authorities have already pledged that hajhajj pilgriinge in mecca will continue with thousands thousands pilgrims still reaching the city.
today, king salman said the binladin group should not have left arm of the butanes high when the bloodshed was not working.
an arab version of the decree, published by the saudi press agency, stated that the binladin group bears partly blame for the collapse.
the news agency's english service did not provide that detail, but said the company leaders had received a ban from leaving the country.
earlier this week, salman instrucw to reveal what led to the collapse of the cranes in the yard of the mosque mosque where hundreds of thousands of muslims came before the hajj pilgriinge later this month.
the binladin group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the cranes, and group representatives could not been contacted for statements.
the royal decree blamed the group for failing to use up-date safety measures and to coordinate its work with the meteorological authorities.
dozens of cranes round the large mosque in mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the binladin group.
for decades, the binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of saudi arabia and is undertaking major construction projects.
the last qaida leader, osama bin laden, was a " renegated, " son uninherited by the family during the 1990s.
the crash occurred in conditions of strong wind and rain, just few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the lives of every muslim is physically fit.
authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
authorities have that the relatives of the deceased victims receive one million saudi riali (gbp 174,000 000) and the same amount pay to those with permanent injuries.
other injured will receive half of that amount.
advantages and disadvantages of credit to swiss franc
two offers for conversion to already appeared to swiss swiss c credit in the banking market,, the main benefits being to exclude the currency risk and rate reduction.
disadvantages may come in a few years' time when the variable interest can lead to the rates increased.
the transylvania bank has just completed the process of conversion appropriations in francs granted by volksbank, and the post has announced the conversion offer for its own clients.
according to data compoated by analysts at finzoom financial portal, banknoknois offering three years of fixed interest at the lei of 1.5%, the lowest in the market.
on the other hand, the transylvania bank offer of conversion was accepted by 83% of customers in francs due to two successive cuts: the balance has been reduced to the value of risk and management fees paid paid by the customer,, then an additional 22.5% reduction in the soil in the lei was applied.
both offers reduce the rates of their own clients, from what they paid equivalent monthly in lei prior to conversion.
thus, the transylvania bank reduces the rate by 42.5 per cent, and banknotes, by 33 per cent in the first three years and, theoretically by 18 per cent over the next few years.
benefits
the main advantage of cofinancing in lcredits in the chf is that it eliminate the currency risk, with the consumer protected by future franc increases, and repayment of credit will be made in the currency they collect their salary.
another major advantage from both offers of conversion is that there is no no re-ment of property, no additional guarantees are being sought and another proof of the revenues.
in practical terms, there be no new financial and legal analysis of credit nor will there be additional costs as in the case of refinancing.
both banks also offer a reduction at the monthly rate from how much customers customers paid before conversion, equivalent to lei.
hazards
the problem is that the rate in the first years is up more of interest and the customer reimburfunds very little of the main.
the offer of a very low-interest bank over the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
it is unclear, however, how this interest will evolve after three years.
the margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25%, so in total, and cost reduction is lower.
a possible risk to all the credits in the variable interest linterest, is that the robor index will increase significantly over the coming years (more than the libor index-chf).
for example, robor three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013, had reached 6% in 2009, at more than 15%, and in a few days from 2008 it exceeded 40%!
in addition, other costs may also arise not mentioned in the initial offer.
time is time for decisions on us federal reserve interest rate
the world is looking eyes at a meeting scheduled in two days' time on wednesday and thursday, when the us federal reserve is to make a crucial decision whether not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
in a reuters poll by participation by 80 economists, more than half who last week the decision would be made, i now believe the situation remain a time longer and that interest rates would be kept within the current of 0-0.25%.
it is an historic event because it has been seven years since the federal reserve brought rates to zero zero.
for the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up its zero zero rate and initiate a process of normalisation of interest rates, " said angel ubide, a senior-analyst at the peterson institute for international economics.
the us economy has developed relatively well, with the recovery of bringing trillion dollars to the balance sheet and leading to low inflation.
but the federal reserve must not ignore the less rorosy global situation.
he has warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that they believe such a move is unlikely.
the decision will be announced on tuesday 20: 00 tec.
stars losing their their air
actor (left), along with his son redmond (right), has experienced stressful situations in recent years.
in 2001, he fought with leukemia and in 2009 he lost his life partner, farrah fawcett, to cancer.
it is also rumoured that the actor faced the problem of drug use, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.

player luke shaw of manchester united is sitting on bara several months because of double fractures.
luke shaw suffered a double fracture on his right leg in a match by manchester united in the champions league, ended with a defeat over psv eindhoven.
after the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and holding the bulara for at least six months, louis van gaal remains optimistic that shaw will be able to play this season.
the accid@-@ up followed an reckless intervention by héctor moreno in the 15th minute after shaw, 20, broke up psv defence.
he received medical care for nine minutes on the field, and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
van gaal said " he has double fracture on the leg and he is in hospital. "
it will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps the day after tomorrow will then be operated in manchester.
it is horrifying - a boy who came to manchester united when he was 18, then he plays fantastic and now this is happening.
in the west, oxygen was put up in the west.
the complaint.
i am not a doctor, but at the double rest fracture is six months and will not be playing in the phase of groups.
i hope he is able to play again this season.
it appears that moreno had luck and got escaped of the red card and the concession of a penalty.
referee nicola rizzoli has failed to punish mexican.
van gaal suggested that the italian official was been wrong.
you can judge alone when they say that it is a foul and the red card.
it was a very ly intervention with two legs.
a message on shaw's twitter account:' thank you all for the messages, i do not have words to express how weak i feel, i start the road to recovery, i will come back stronger.'

the defender of the england of england has another reason to recover to play at the european championship in france next june.
phillip cocu, the psv coach, said " it is a very uginjury. "
everyone is very sad when a player suffers suffering such a by-injury.
our players never aim to accidr a opponent.
moreno torvered his leg playing mexico mexico national team against the national national, led by van gaal at the 2014 world championship.
" it is very difficult because he did not intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it is a very serious injury, it's not good, " cocu said.
i have not seen it.
i only to only see the ball, who was in a different direction so appeared like [moreno] achieved it but i could not see intervention against luke.

adam lyth clearly ried england's omission but still large
the victory against pakistan in the united arab emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the england selected for the tournament, it are no contemplof a 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
i would not rule out a travelling victory either.
alastair cook's team has less experience than three years ago, but it has good players on the back in the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by events in 2012 but will have a positive attitude to young youth.
moeen ali develops as a spinner and adil rashid, even if unknown at the test level, is an option for the attack.
similar topics: adam lyth left the england team for the test matches and was replaced by alex hales
obviously, as the chief coach of or in yorkshire, i is difficult to consider decision not to select adam lyth on the team.
he played the seven test matches against two good strikers in difficult conditions, and the the simple but harsh reality is cricicplayers are being tried by the results.
there were no question marks about joe root, for example, until the announcements were made, because - and i said this before - the players are their own selection.
for a fifty years, and perhaps lyth would have extended his run, but his destiny is in his hands.
i hope that if it makes several runs for yorkshire will have other opportunities.
the chief coach of the england team, trevor bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance was match match his capacity and and it does surprising surprise me; above all, he is a team man.
it is hard to answer the question how long a sman has noted at at test matches.
lyth had seven runs -- like sam robson before him -- while nick compton had nine.
only compton was luck at home and in moving.
the only dissatisfaction you can have was that that england preferred jonathan trott in the caribbean tour - when lyth was in maximum shape - but that missed opportunity is something of the past.
on the team comes alex hales, a man that i meet very well.
he is a cricket player who has the " factor x " and which i saw earlier in yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a pitch trent bridge.
they should be at least the same opportunity as those before her, but this will course depend on the composition of the uae team.
the idea was launched, that moeen opening to beates alongside cook, which would lead extra spinner while preserving four quicquicks, and i have nothing against it.
i do not see why a shoter ter not strike there, and this clumsy player has already demonstrated he is being naïve.
perhaps moeen did not bring success in his district, worcestershire, but was 3 3 them, so the difference is not great.
my old team colleague, justin langer, played his first 38 test games matches as first drop before he entered the open in 2001.
it immediately ped away three centuries and did not look back.
zafar ansari comes on the team as back-up spinner, and, although i had limited contact with him, i struck struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
people could judge the young age -- with an average of 31 to beating and 35 at the ball -- and they might think it is pun,, but is is no cataload of nibles, and the selection opted for young people.
it will learn a lot from the tournament.
england has brought some changes to the training team as well.
the appointment of mahela jayawardene, batsman of sri lanka, as consultant for test matches could be a blow of master.
he is one of the best players and he will bring great experience, since he has played in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
paul collingwood comes to white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring hard ruless energy and ambition.
i have always believed that he was born to become involved in the international cricket, as a player or a coach, and like mahela, has a intution.
sometimes, new voices in the west, even if they send messages messages sent earlier earlier, can bring fresh air to the team.
colly durham's teammate, ben stokes restrest for the one-day matches, root received a similar break against australia, and i have no problem with that.
although not all agree, coaches and selection do not do the programme.
and you have to note, the players of players depend on the results they achieve.
such decisions can never be taken ghtly.
brexit camp could succeed if economy s in acl by 2017
day passing day, the strategy of renegotiating david cameron to keep the eu is getting getting deeper into the mess angle even without the choice of genigeniharry jeremy' yes or no? " corbyn to the helm of the labour or tuc is is in serious criticism of europe on tuesday.
foreigners also have characters as corbyn and nigel farages.
a european diplomat explained explained past days that -- sunmerged in crises similar that in the eu -- not all being caused internally -- some member states are being fuelled with the britain's agenda for concessions and changes to the treaties, which the majority do not want.
in brighton, at the annual meeting, tuc decided that they would not want it if they erode social protection.
we could even call it the dave and george's' sel' agenda.
the prime minister and chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, make a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then come back home and say they have won allies for reform.
it is only about me.
my european friend, who wants a great forward-looking perspective under the eu roof -' not leave alone with france, " says berlin -- suggests that several short-minded ministers and officials officials of some capitals have reached the point point where they do not care whether they are staying or leave.
the cau, extremely cautious ary german chancellor, is an ally but was ered for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation breaks settled, as with ththatcher 11 11), mitterrand (14)) and kohl (16), who stayed too long.
in 2017, france's president françois hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
his strength is also declining.
poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, spain a lefleft.
it is hard to believe that they will help the english who pose, whose energy would be better better used to prevent scotland from out of britain - something that they do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
thus, some ministers may even plan to make remarks that do not help in the style of snp in the campaign for the uk referendum in 2017 to speed up the brebling process, my amfriend suggests.
the " renegotiation was fixed " and " britain gained nothing value the renegotiation. "
europeans know on their own how acer fleet street can be and how sceptical the oligarchic press barons are view the eu with scepticism, because they did not participate in the referendum of 1975 inspired by tony benn are, which ratified our entry from 1973 in report 2: 1.
perhaps i vfully ely boris boris johnson the euro euro unistic, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a brussels corespoent.
ed miliband knew enemies.
they have included the mixture of non-paying bags, foreigners who were stetelephones and pseudo non-domi who hold most major newspapers.
in fact, tony blair sees them the same but he realised that when you're closed in a cbox with a nervous gorla, you must give his bananas to distrt their attention from the thought of eating midnoon and again at tea.
in fact, miliband was sofder than blair in opposition to cameron's idea of a referendum, since blair had made a concession on the principle to de@-@ abandoned eu constitution, was buried by french and dutch voters back back 2005 2005 who gave him a card out of exit.
the media did not forgive him for that either.
but jeremy corbyn, who reached my friendship behind the back monday at westminster - i told him not to waste his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting on o the murdoch strategy strategy ting the boycott of neil kinnock in the 1980s, which would be a mistake then and now.
it can last, but it must develop a coherent co-cooperation with the media media not with me, but certainly with andrew marr, whose position at the bbc left her vacation holiday sunday.
corbyn's official position on europe is what i would call a lenient development.
he says he would like us to remain in a reformed eu.
most who do not agree with the conservative' anglicism' might agree to that.
that said hilary " a benane but not a bennite " benn on radio and tv this week, when the researcher in he led not to admit that the nomination appointment of john mcdonnell by corbyn as a minister " in the shadow of seat " on financial financial issues was a bad idea.
he reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on tv to be unfair to his labour colleagues, without going too far and losing his office in the cabinet.
hilary's struggle has been more attractive.
but the fight to remain " in any situation' - benn's expression - does does not correspond to what mcdonnell, nor also with what jjc told colleagues and lawmakers at a private meeting monday night.
regardless of the image corbybyn wants to convey - note, it also made me aware - the discipline discipline of the messages remains important in the television era, and particular in the throstrom of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and treason.
it is right not to be given cameron a favourable yes ticket in europe, allowing him to take good good support of labour labour in the referendum campaign, as mcdonnell has said.
simon jenkins certainly believes that.
but the phistry of mcdonnell and corbyin of eu membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is longer longer an ezoterical discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narnarsiism of small differences is a central dogma.
as in the case of sophistry regarding nato - tom watson is adamant that the jc will not campaign campaign for opt-up - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand.
why should paris or berlin of political capital be waste - and there are suspicious voters voters - for concessions towards britain when everything could be useless?
the us is already quite disappointed about the poor military performance of english in iraq, libya and syria, even with a conservative government cost-cutting ing, as i was reminded at the launch of the british influence security forum on monday.
specialists criticise england public health department's decision on electronic cigarettes
according to the researchers, claims by a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with links in the tobacco industry.
specialists from the editorial team of the british medical journal (bmj) have joined the lancet in criticising asting evidence used by the english department of public health (sustainability) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
he published the " reference " report last month, described it as a " complex analysis of evidence. "
some researchers, however, have questioned the robustness of data and have pointed their finger at links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
an article published last month in the lancet medical magazine attacked the " extraordinarily tly fragile base " that the foundation the main conclusion founded.
two other researchers writing in bmj have questioned the claims and founding them " on solid soil or on quickstic sand. "
martin mckee, european public health professor at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, and simon capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at liverpool university, have said:' a fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on proof of effectiveness. "
they said that they expected that claims of claims stating that' current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking'' are based on a-depth analysis of evidence and models.
in reality, one meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a model for multiple decision-analysis (mcda) to synsummart their views on the negative effects associated with the various of containing nicocontaining nicotina drawn up; the results of this meeting were sumsumeded@-@ presented in a research work.
mckee and capewell, or said one sponsors of the meeting was a company called euroswiss health, whose executive executive director said to have, in the past received funding from british american tobacco for conducting an independent study.
it also validated the's bat in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
they added that one of 12 participants in the meeting said funding from a producer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding there are reports reported would have received from the cigarette and tobacco company, philip morris international.
arguments have not provided provided the arguments on which the site have been selected, but include some " frunscosi " known in the production of e-cigarettes, some of them even say financing for the industry in the work.
others attending the meeting are not known for expertise in tobacco control.
the meeting also attended the head of the tobacco control section in the umbrella.
the research work prepared by the group " convincingly cloremorup " the fact that the lack of " solid evidence of the detrimental effect that most products are having in accordance of most criteria, " mckee and capewell said.
however, in the report on none of these links or limitations are mentioned.
mckee and capewell said the asserallegations that " so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking smoking children children or non-smokers " are premature.
professor kevin fenton, director of the department of health within the framework, says says he has responded in the past to the bmj claims.
he says " electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking "
one in two people who smoke lost their lives because of this vice.
all the evidence suggests that the risk posed by e-health cigarettes is minor in comparison, but we need to continue to look at the long-term effects.
posting has a clear duty to inform the public about information information breaks out and that does not come out of evidence, especially given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
annually, about 80,000 people lose their due to a disease associated with smoking, and the annual costs of national nhhealthcare from smoking reach gbp 2 billion.
making the current evidence clear - which is that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not run risk of risk, they present only a fraction of the perverdetrimental effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

violinist david grimal: during bach's age there was no no world tourntour.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people working, artists, rather not commercial representatives.
french violinist david grimal is a great artists of our time, known not only as singer as an initiator of a less ordinary project, to right' odd', as he himself says, les dissonsonances - an orchestra of international soloists and talented talented musicians, who a a symsymtoire without a conductor or at least a scenery.
les dissonances was at the ennescu festival with two performances: a performance sunday in which solist was david grimal, founder of the orchestra, and one, and one monday, there the focus of violcellist xavier phillips, and with the work comup by enescu being nelipsite.
both performances, held on the athens scene, showed the public public another way of interpret classical music.
les dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 was, at the time, the only classical musical, in which there was no conductor.
the conductor is the musimportant musimportant for musicians.
it is true, on the one hand, musicians need education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - i speak of instrumolors, not than composers.
they are trained as' specialised workers'.
they themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.
on the other side of the scene, for the public, all musical complaint focuses on the conductor.
and so business, the music industry, makes marketing.
so we are not talking about music.
so, if we look at this world we have have qualified workers on one hand which is stupid, and a public who cannot listen, but but has to look, what, which is stupid, " says david grimal.
the violinist reports that the change in the way music music has come from the " musical dissiontions " in his singer career.
i was like a high-level athlete who had to make the same exercise around the world with different orchestras,, to earn much money and and bring money and the music industry.
10 years ago, when i was around 30, i found this very depressing, because because i no longer find human creativity and fraternity in this system.
so we have not found any point in continuing down this road.
so i decided to create les dissonances.
this was in 2004, and at that time no one was doing this without a conductor:' the music world, extremely conservative world, did not want such projects'.
" how can you imagine doing marketing with a collective ch of musicians where there is no longer ego? " the artist asks.
david grimal acknowledges that les dissonaces is " a luxury, " saying that none of the musicians belonging in the orchestra depends on the project's success to live.
in 10 years of its existence, the lack of a conductor proved proved unsuccessful in the musical act: " curiously, the more we weigh a more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are forced to be present in the work, and not just in their role, " grimal, adding that at sunday's show " we were 74 conductors on the stage. "
in grimal, the ennescu festival is a' very courageous', precisely because it also invited les dissonances:' an extraordinary festival where the largest orchestras in the world that sing and 3 times a day are present, and in the middle of these orchestras also invited this odd group.'
in a temple of the orchestatic tradition, such as the enenescu festival, there is a place and interest in something different, which breaks barriers.
speaking about enescu's work, the violinist acknowledges he feels romanian music of the famous romanian composer, so he did need need a special approach when he introduced enenescu works on his repertoire.
grimal notes that enescu's music is very instinctive, but that's when we talk about george enescu and romanian music, " because there is also george george enescu who has been the french music. "
grimal is advocating for changing the way classical musical education is done, believing that " the musician profession, as is organised today, has a iz of death " and " the future of music is the music itself. "
we do not need to make the world tour 5 times a year if it serves for nothing.
in the era of bach there were no world tournaments.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people working work who were artists, and not commercial representatives.
for me, the organisation of concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albums, are all formidable, extraordinary, but as long they they done in the service of music.
if not, we are in a system in which creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
to illustrate this phenomenon, david grimal set the example of romanian products before and after the accession: " in romania, before entering the eu you had good vegetables and meat. "
to enter the eu you have had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
production and agriculture are at the service of the supermarkets, as is in france.
with music the same thing, it is the same logic.
les dissonances makes tomatoes may not very nice, but when we cut them are real oes.
in an ideal world, we should this music to return to the centre and for the institutions and industries that manage this system should understand that music does not need to be sold, it needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with education policy.
" if we thought -- as koreans, the chinese, japanese -- that western music among the most beautiful things of humanity, we would introduce his learning to school, we would introduce concerts on the television screens through this education there would be no need to sell musical by-products, " grimal believes.
there are certainly things in classical musical education that remain very communist, all everywhere, is something very militarised.
it is up on this discipline whether we compare a musician with a soldier, or whether we are forming a musician who will sing at an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
this is a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) we have to be a way, if we want to form a musician, it is something different different.
in your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier, or a musician? " the french artist asks smilsmiling.
grimal shows that for artists to reward another kind of doing music comes precisely from overcoming this' soldier' status, transgoing beyond what " they believe are their limits':' musicians musicians discover at a certain time that they are not soldiers, and therefore after the concert shows smilambers. "
david grimal spoke of his musical project and his vision of music music and artist as of the " festival of ideas, " a discussion with the public held at the george enescu international festival by the aspen romania institute.

fedex gains are mixed, lower fiscal forecast for 2016
fedex said disappointing results for the last quarter, with the supply giant reducing profit estimates for the whole year due to low demand for transport services and the increased costs for its land transport division.
the company also said it plans to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
during the same last year, fedex x announced would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for holiday holidays.
company company shares dropped by about 2.5% in the pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of wednesday's opening bell.
fedex corp. said he expects to earn between $10.40 and 10.90 for the fiscal year ending in may next year with 20 cents less, according to a earlier estimate.
analysts had expecting $10.84, according to a survey by factset.
the falling estimate comes despite price hikes by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 january and higher surcharges for terrestriland transport of large or high-weight packages, which will apply since november.
the company said it still expects more gains from the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and development of-@-@ commerce.
the president and general director fred smith said " the company faces a considerably weaker economic situation expected, especially with regard to global production and trade. "
plans for employment during the holidays were announced a day after ups ups tor said it plans to hire 990,000-95,000 workers, about the same number of hithat it made last year.
in the quarter that ended on august 31st, fededex earned $692m, a 6% more than the previous year.
gains per share were $2.42, below the an average estimate of $2.44 per share by 12 analysts responding to the zacks investment research poll.
profits has increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
six analysts who participated in the zacks poll estimated $12.23 billion.
fedex has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, which leading to stagnation in revenues recorded by its unit express.
but the explosion in online shopping salded the results of the fedex ground division.
in the last quarter, revenues of the ground division increased by 29%, but operational revenues practically stagnstalled due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
the express unit registered an increase in revenue due to higher basic tariffs, while revenues registered by the freight division have dropped due to rising costs.
in pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, fedex shares had dropped $3.85 or 2.5%, to $150.15.
at the closure tuesday fell by 11 per cent year-on-year level and 17 per cent compared to a record peak on june 11th.
at the most expected meeting in recent years, the policymaking makers at the federal reserve will spend two days this week around an honduran mahon table table 27 leglegs to decide whether the time has come to step up a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
above them, at an end of the central bank's room, there will be be a dirty painting of the united states.
the map is intended to recall that janet l. yellen, chairman of the edf and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all.
the central bank has received a dual task from congress: to maximise the employment rate in the us, to maintain price stability.
but since the great economic crisis, the edf leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
and this third task could be the x factor in too difficult difficult to anticipate to be announced tuesday, and which will determine whether the us economy is ready to be dissted by the unprecedented stimulus offered by the short-term near-zero interest rate in force as of the end of 2008.
even though most data indicate a strong growing economy, the recent stir on the global financial markets could sten edf officials are already cautious of the addition of volatility by increasing the the reference rate to federal federal - even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
" obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues that they will pursue, " said lindsey m. piegza, chief chief economist at the brokeraj-company firm stifel nicolaus & co.
" but i think that if they looked for an excuse not to increase interest rates, growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait, " she said.
there is no consensus on the decision that the edf will take, which, in itself, causing instability in the financial market.
about half of the economists questioned recently by bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
but financial markets expect the edf to put off, with a key indicator showing that the likelihood probgrowth is only 30%.
this would indicate a drop on the exchange if the edf increases its interest rate, unless those who draw up policies were shiten the blow, promising it would be a long time until the next growth.
on tuesday, dow dow jones industrial average up 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent to 16,599.85.
the momentum stemmed by expectations the edf makers will maintain the stable interest rates this week, said john lonski, chief economist at moody's capital markets research group.
" it would be surprising that the edf increased the interest rate at this moment, " lonski said.
if the edf decision makers did so, " they should act deeply in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets..
other experts have said that an increase in interest rates would reassure the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the edf will act.
just a month ago, the edf appeared to be about to increase the rate by 0.0.25% month, the first small step towards the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the force of the us recovery.
yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected an increase in interest rates this year despite objections raised by the liberals that more economic progress is needed.
although job creation sslowed down in august, labour market growth was strong this year.
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in in than seven years, and close to the level considered by the edf as full employment.
salary gains show signs of growth.
and although inflation has continued to meet the central bank's annual target, edf edf decision makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of oil prices in absharply.
the economy " can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tension in the labour market, " said shepherdson, chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics.
but the global financial markets began to enter fibrilations later this month, after china devalued its currency.
the dow jones industrial average dropped 16 per cent below the record peak reached in may, as investors were afraid that a slowdown in the chinese economy would bring world growth down.
the market was a somewhat this month, with the dow index now now about 10% below the maximum in may.
for decision makers the edf, the market pror is added to the complex calculation of the time of increase in interest rates.
" without what happened on financial markets and news about the weakening the chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be stronger at the meeting, " said stephen d. oliner, an experienced researcher at the ucla ziman center for real estate and former edf official.
now, he is expected to wait at least a month to deal with the effects better.
" there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the us economy will be and almost hardly no data to be based based on events in china, " oliner said.
the welfare of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the edf, so should should not be taken into account in decision making.
in reality, however, the edf has become monetary authority at global level.
in recent years the central central bank influence has been huge.
just the illusion of then-president, ben s. bernanke, in 2013, that edf could could narronarrow' its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in the global markets.
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly ddfurther, it is also expected that edf officials not only to monitor progress made in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to better better of the world economy.
his decision-making process is " more art than science, " said zachary karabell, head of the department of global strategy in the welfare management firm envestnet inc.
jeffrey lacker, president of federal reserve bank in richmond, va, said this month that " edf has a historic over-sized response to changes in the financial market that appear not be related to economic bases. "
lacker, a voting member of the federal committee on the open market, a decision-making body, which supported an increase in the interest rate, has offered the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
a financial crisis that has affected asia led the edf to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, " despite the implications with limited identification for us development, " lacker said.
a year later, edf officials have recovered to those maturity.
the edf should put the issue of financial stability first only in a major crisis, such as the market earthquake in 2008, said adam s. posen, a former interest rate member at the bank of england.
the recent turbulent period is far near that level, he said.
" we certainly don't want to end up in a position to worry of an increase in interest rates because the markets have angupset, " said posen, president of the peterson institute for international economics.
the federal reserve act still holds a twin dual mandate and it does not mention financial stability and, until anything changes in this regard, i do not believe that it should take premature action.

the violence occurred late tuesday in the district of dehi district, about 280km west of the capital kathathmandu.
according to bishnu prasad dhakal, district police chief, over 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, while some threw stones and molotov cocktails.
mr dhakal said that police forces used tear gas after they they wn up before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
according to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
it was not immediately immediately why rubber bullets, which are known known to kill but but are usually used as a lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
the clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of nepal, where members of the madhesi ethnic group say new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
protests were also protests in west west nepal, where the tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes staged on 10 august.

weight-cutting surgery could be useful for diabetics with light obesity
the benefits of burden-reduction cyrily for liweight obesity people, type 2-type diabet sugar could remain for at least five years, according to a new study.
it is still premature to say whether light obesity diabetics are living after weight-loss surgeons than those who follow unhirurgical treatments.
" it's taking a long time to centralise the mortality data, " said dr robin blackstone, a specialist on obesity surgery, who wrote an article on the new study in jama surgery.
operations for weight loss,, named and bariatric surgery, use various methods to decrease the dst.
they reduce the sense of hunger and limit the ability of the body to absorb food.
over the years, surgery of the bariric has proven efficiency in treating type 2-sugar diabetes, but most studies performed on morbida obesity with a corporate index (imc) (imc).
the imc, a unit of weight in relation to its,, considered normal normal between 18.5-24.9.
the imc value of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and imimin more than 30 are regarded as obese.
you can calculate your imc by accessing 1.usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
for the new study, researchers at taiwan general min-sheng hospital the data collected after 2007 in a trial where it compare two types of surgery of the barrier - bypass gastric and gastrectomie tohospital in manson - in the medical treatment of the 2-type sugar dietet to people with light obesity.
the imc environment to people who have suffered surgery has dropped from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the study.
meanwhile, the imc to people who received non hirurgical treatments against the sugar diabetes remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
of those who have suffered surgon, the sugar diabetet fully sold ed at 36% and partly at 28%.
in the group treated by medical methods, by comparison the sugar diabetet was sold ed to only 1% and partly to only 2% of the subjects.
in addition, control of blood tension, trigliceridele and lldl cholesterol evil' were generally better in the surgical group, " the authors concluded.
researchers also monitored the sanguin level of hemoglobin a1c, reflecting level level of licemia over time.
researchers write that the best level of lynemoin a1c is below 7%.
after surgery intervention, the average level of hemoglobin a1c has dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
but in the group group using medical medical methods, it been kept at about 8%.
but this improved " glicemical control " -- reflected by the improved levels of a1c globe -- did not reduced the death rate to five years, according chief researcher dr chih-cheng hsu and colleagues.
the research team also compared average results associated to the two types of surgical intervention.
in fifth%, compared to the group gastrectomie in manson, the bypass group lost more weight (7% (7% to 14.2 kg), recorded more significant falls in imc value (7.4 compared to 5.1) and the hemoglob's a1c (3.1% to 2.1%), and a higher sugar probability.
although the new study does not indicate any benefit in survival or surgery later, there is evidence of a study by high weiweiin sweden that surgical intervention extends life, says says blackstone of the arizona university, the faculty of medicine - phoenix.
in the swedish study, obese people who suffered surgery on the bariric probably showed about 29% less to die 15 years years than a group that tried more conventional methods.
although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival to patients who have surgery surgery, blackstone said it is an optimistic point for those imc under 35 interested in the procedure.
" this is the point where this work is critical, because it says that this surical intervention is safe in the lower imc group, " without an increased risk of death or renal disease, she says.
blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start -- take weight seriously then the patient's imc reaches 27-30.
" i think we are waiting too long until we urge on people to take this seriously, " she said.
i believe that once they have accumulthese genetic modifications that have short circuited their pre-disposing them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.

force has never solved these problems, " he added.

why i see execution in oklahoma
later today, apart ring from belated legal intervention, i will look how a man to death is sentenced.
if that happens and i hope it does not happen, i will sit in a room for observers from the state penitentiary oklahoma's execution room and will see how richard glossip is executed by managing the latvian injection.
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
the invitation first came in january, through his best friend, and although i have been shocked, i accepted.
as the day lauantly approaches, i am appalled at the idea.
so why should i?
i agreed because i thought that this is a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
it would offer a single perspective.
it is true, journalists can witness the executions in america and, because applications usually exceed beyond the number of places available, a macabra lottery occurs to decide who will be elected.
oklahoma has reduced the number reserved reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
those elected will view the execution impartially.
i cannot do that.
i would stand next to richard glossip's closest friends, in addition i have developed my own connection with him over the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two half hours.
i like the type.
we often waste a lot when we speak.
prison authorities say i cannot be a witness and a journalist too, so i will not be allowed to have a carid and a pix to note at what i see.
i will have to try to remind all of the details.
a journalist from oklahoma accused twitter of compromising my impartiality.
that is the lesson.
it tells the story of the holder as he wants, it gets access.
i complained about it.
he admitted that' he could have formulated better', but still believes i am wrong.
richard glossip did not agree with some of the things i have said and i have written.
he does not tell me what to write, and i would not do so even asked me.
i told him that he could remove me from the list of witnesses any time.
but he wants an international report writing on the subject to be present.
he believes that, if it dies, advertising will help the movement against the death penalty.
kim bellware, a reporter for huffington post will be with me.
if you want to learn more about the case, you are listening to the series of multimedia files that we have made.
i will not come back to all of the details.
i cannot say with certainty that richard glossip is innocent.
his actions following the murder of barry van treese guilty of complicity.
but i think he is likely not to be guilty of murder.
i firmly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
i believe that his execution is wrong.
and i will watch it by dying away this perspective.
i cannot claim to be totally objective.
for that you read read articles written by other reporters.
from me, you will find out how it is watch watch man he like by hurneedunnecessarily.
peter moody says stewarali tried to spy him, threatens to pull out of es
peter moody said steware racing his victory tried to infiltrate a spy into his stables last year and threatened to pull immediately out of races.
he launched an attack on stewards and the integrity department of racing victoria, saying they are conducting a personal campaign against him, which filled the glass with the ouout of lady tatai from the race due to treatment he administered on race day.
moody told fairfax media that it has always tried to do what is best for flights, and is put in a difficult when it comes to the positive outcome at lidari's balance test, for which he has no explanation.
for 18 months he swallowed his words about statements about spies, and he did want want to like a' volcano that does not reach grapes'.
" i was not going to say anything about that and i was quiet for a long time but but sometimes i reach a level of so frustration that it all burks all one point, " said moody.
we know they has continued.
sometimes you react and you have to suffer the consequences, and i will have to live with what i have said.
i will go home last night and sleep in ease.
i want to go down my heads high, i want the owners owners i work to see that i strive to offer them all the best.
once they start to believe that this is not be the case, they must give away from the traler profession.
at that point i will have to consider what i will do with my certification.
earlier, moody threw the bomb in an interview with racing.com, which said the integrity department tried to spy its files.
" eighteen months ago, terry bailey, dayle brown and dr brian stewart stood in a room with a man -- whom whom i will say if i am asked - and volunteoffered to commit him to my stin order provide some information on the work there, " moody said for racing.com.
obviously, i see me as a trisor.
if that is the case, then they should all step down because they were incompetent in they attempt to catch me.
robert roulston, former president of rvl, david moodie, current cl president and bernard saundry, the current executive ceo of rvl, knew at the time and i know today.
should i think that this is something bit personal?
is it necessary for the cl to start having the backbone and can hold people from outside the people for what is happening in the industry?
do i have bad influence on the industry?
so bad is my influence on industry?
maybe that is how others see.
perhaps they have to take my license and give me aside, and i have no doubts that the statements i am making now could lead them to think about this.
however, i have reached the point where i no longer care and that is makes i sadsad.
i am saddened saddened.
i will put pressure and get them to make a decision.
my family stands behind me and i can leave.
frustration with the traler has increased with the long-investigation into cobalale testing involving the leaders, and the elimination led him to say that they could " place his license on the table. "
moody, whose name most often associated with the codefeated the undefeated black caviar, labelled the treatment rule on race's day as " ridiculous ridiculous " after having applied to the foot of horses horses to a catapllwith namol or argila, in violation of the rules.
it violates the racof rules.
i must take full responsibility for this, " he says.
one of my employees put them namdge mistake on the foot.
it could have happened last night.
it could have happened yesterday, which happened.
it happened on race race day.
moody could be disqualified for three months for the one-day treatment in application of catapllia, for which stewarş opened an investigation.
it is a joke.
the people who do these rules do not know about horses.
" we all understand the rules are needed, but it has gone too far, " moody said.

coach melbourne storm, craig bellamy, answering their opponents in wrestling wrestling charges.
coach melbourne storm, craig bellamy named criticism of his team's placking tactics as " distorted topics topics " raised by the two top favourites in nrl.
sydney coach roosters coach trent robinson said referees have allowed storm players to " take them to tranta " the team team won nervos de storm in the qualifying finals in sydney late friday.
brisbane broncos coach wwayne bennett made a slight reference to storm after his team's victory in north queensland cowboys qualifying match late saturday, when he called the " demonstration " by the league of rugrugby league and said said the two teams in queensland were not too big ep in wrestling.
bellamy jumped in defence of placing tactics addressed by his team, and said the players simply focused on " contact " when they liked.
bellamy says he gained confident after two leading coaches criticised his team, meaning that they were concerned that storm storm will win.
" and things don not stop here -- i did not hear trent robinson to complain for wrestling when he beat 24-2 2, " bellamy said wednesday.
i can guarantee that we have changed nothing all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so only as in the last six weeks, we have really placed on contact in placence and have thus changed the situation.
trent has been in office for three years, and obviously he has a wonderful team so it is probably not used to lose and was a shock to him.
we know how it always happens during this period of year.
bellamy disagreed bennett's idea of " enanimate football, " recalling bennett's mentor st george-illawarra dragons won won championship championship 2010 2010 by playing " boring " football.
wayne talks about pitpitfootball.
he argued his opinion comparing his saturday evening game to our game friday evening, and spoke of how paling the game was, " bellamy said.
i remember that in 2010, st george received a lot of criticism for he was a boring team and wayne said he did not concern him in how much black under thail.
but now now has a team that can play what we would consider palexciting football, especially because of quick young midfielders.
this kind of game want to make it when you have such a players.
he brought that argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play -- not any team has two midfielders like anthony milford and ben hunt be able to play the way.
it gives me more confidence because they are saying this because they am somewhat concerned about the match with us.
six weeks ago they probably not think of us when they considered the important matches.
bellamy also emphasised that the match between storm and roosters was a heacer intit compared to broncos and cowboys.
the match of those at broncos was probably a good match, we have not seen it yet, how was the score 16-12?
our match ended up 20-18, in our game were two two more attempts, does that mean tangible game?
or does paltutuing mean making breaks and not marching?
there are plans for me.
if i talk about us, it means that we could meet them at some point.
storm is free this weekend because they were right to play home either with north queensland cowboys or cronulla sharks in the preliminary final next saturday in aami park, with tickets on sale next morning.

friendsfest: comedy series that has taught us important lessons about male friendship.
the absence of similar figures in the series is obvious, as the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching the peak of the past 15 years.
in 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in 20-45 aged men britain britain and remains three times more common for men than in women.
in an bid to address the problem, the campaign against unfortunate life (campaign against living miserably (calm) named 2015 as the man's year, wanting to question question culture culture that prevents men from applying for help when they need.
friendship lies at the heart of the fight towards this success.
a recent study of more than 2000 high-school students featuring symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by sufficiently many friends " with a healthy of good mood, " his chances for recovery doubles.
similarly, for people who are not being represpressed, a circle of mental healthy friends is halving the probability of mental disorders appearing.
of course, in order for friendship to have effect, it must primarily be accessible.
in this era of the communication dominated by social media, where emphasis is placed on style and not on the substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes precedence before making ational contact.
our digital lives have doubled the need to create the apparent appearance of a strong figure open to fun and successful personality, even though in reality, isolation is the one that domin.
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call as extrinar values; money, the image, the social status, all with the cost of the intrinsic values - our inner desire for our personal development and friendship - which has even deeper damage on our mental health.
the billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that the money really does not buy happiness.
the beauty of the friends series was that it has turned on this idea.
the ters were not defined by the workplace, but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
mour of joey and chandler's frequent ations, when watching football in the coent seof es and his passion for roel have came from the fact that men are known known can associate themselves to this situation, though, even though they often get to fully explore their feelings.
as one social worker explained to me:'... my role in listening to to people with a suicide and depressed has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference. "
often, people turning to us do not feel able to speak to friends.
his old saying manage alone is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak out about the problems.
friends is one of the series that come to mind when i try to provide more long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
the series highlighted the the small moments of friendship between men.
as much as help objective, outside intervention help via the phone, people have arrived in times of desperair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
thus, if you attend this weekend in friendfriendest est organised by the edy edy, with the complete offices of filming ers to celebrate the event, why not not invite your friends to a coffee in central perk.
or, even still, if you see someone alone in starbucks, smiling and i ute ute.
it is never known what difference your friendship could make.
friends are aired on central comedy from the scrinch -- all 236 episodes -- on g at # friendsfest
di maria marks, helps bsp set malmo aside
angel di maria celebrates with blaise matuidi and edinson cavani after having marked against malmo.
angel di maria marked in her debut match in the champions league on tuesday and helped the bsp assert out before sweden's malmo.
we are presenting you consistently to the match and reaction to the game.
angel di maria and edinson cavani did their job, paris saint-germain starting from the series of matches in champions league league, with a peaceful 2-0 victory over malmo in a match on the des princes on tuesday.
di maria marked in less than four minutes after the start of her debut match in the bsp league in bsp bsp, france's champions to the advantage though having missed missed a number of opportunities before securing her lead with the goal he scored by kghts in the 61st minute.
reaching group a a with real madrid and sahtior donetk, paris needed a strong start against the swedish champions because the french team's objective is not to qualify for optimes but also an improvement in the journey to the quarfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
but while taking the points, the students of laurent blanc were far from a perfect picture with zlatan ibrahimovic who wasted the goal opportunity then replaced by the team in his hometown of and as the club where which began their brilliant career in 1999.
" it is not easy to win home or travel to the champions league league so the 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and it establishes a comfortable difference with respect to the to to classes, even though there are still issues of of that we have to perffine over the course of the season, " blanc says.
that is a good sign.
we wanted to win, and we did, although i am sorry we we failed to give one or two goals.
ibrahimovic returned after accidinjury to one of three changes to the team in paris, with a 2-2 obtained home by bordeaux in league 1 league the weekend, but di di maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
when he was transferred from manchester united, the argentinian midfielder was appointed the man to lead the bsp to the next level and and demonstrated this when he tasared to the care of marco verratti behind defence of malmo before he subneaunbelievably over johan wiland in the long corner on the right of the gates.
but if anyone expected that the bsp would win victory by dping off their fingers, they have been disappointed.
malmo, who beat out celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine holders on national teams, with a defence from five people and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
but their attack was not impressive, except to the hundreds by nikola djurdjic who passed on from kevin trapp in the 34th minute.
instead, the bsp players slowed down the pace several times, giving several unnecessary passes and not finalising the interventions, even ibrahimovic, who missed as fewer than five attempts only in the first half alone, and was then been replaced by by knights even after the resumption of the game.
ibrahimovic, however, has proven more skilled in supporting her colleagues, caring for care what di maria sent to a sidet off by wiland the gate in the 52nd minute.
the second goal finally enbed after taking one hour hour in the match thanks to cavani,, uruguayan scored the sixth goal of the season after ibrahimovic passed from maxwell's centset.
that goal has eliminated hope for those in malmo to rebalance the score and only a beautiful stop by wiland from a distance to reject david luiz still maintained the final score before the newly entry ezequiel lavezzi is cancelled a goal in the extensions.
the team's norwegian coach in malmo, age haid, later said that the bsp was a-class and that " the last match we played in the champions league was december last year. "
since then, we have only played in the league of sweden, which is not exactly equal par.
qualifications are not enough.
the bsp record down.
they made an excellent game.

it was of good sense that the tvr leadership is present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like this.
the invitation came to members as as last night, with an approximating hour that we did not know any new either, but today, after the meeting of the joint offices, i personally sent a fax to the tvr management by inviting her.

miners will not be done.
it is important is political decisions to be taken for this institution to work.
i am not his man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand in the queue here and knock it.
i hope that those who decide, the parliament's plenary, through their vote, choose with great reason reason the people who will lead the tvr.
it must be people who know what is happening there, have experience and have a lot of correctness and respect for the institution and tradition.
i do not know who will be, if you ask me what qualities it have - common sense in the attitude to employees because it is a malagce of petitions coming from employees, complaints, redundancies.

ponta, charged with uncontrolled libel, irrational
hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto condemned harsh, wednesday morning, romanian romanian prime minister victor ponta said that political decision makers in hungary are " " nothing better than those in syria, libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing. "
" yesterday, victor ponta lost his self-control and, with his irrational assertions it offoffending the entire hungary, " the hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
civilised european politicians do not say such uncontrolled slander.
" his remarks have one explanation: he has completely lost its support in domestic politics in romania, " the head of hungarian diplomacy, according to the mti.
in a posting on facebook late tuesday, prime minister victor ponta said he wants to draw attention and sanction the behaviour of senior hungarian government officials, who he believes " are a disgrace to the culture and values of the eu. "
i do not want to respond to the challenges posed by hungarian government representatives.
" they are a disgrace for the european union's culture and values; and in anti-semitic attitudes, and the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis! " ponta said on facebook.
the romanian prime minister added that he advocated rational and sustainable solutions in the case of refugee crisis, acknowledging that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will show that in hungary in the heart of europe, they are political decision makers nothing better than those those in syria, libya or other countries that those refugees are fleeing!
" i believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority european values -- what we have seeing in recent days in hungary hungary is at contradiction with precisely these goals and values! " the head of the romanian executive stressed.
earlier tuesday, hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto described as " simple lies " the remarks by romanian prime minister victor ponta about hungary's management of the refugee crisis, acknowledging that those claims are inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to the mti.
the head of hungarian diplomacy also noted on tuesday that the " extremist and misleading remarks " by the romanian prime minister concern the domestic political crisis in romania, and added that budapest is apologising from the romanian side.
szijjarto referred to a statement by prime minister victor ponta on monday.
what i have said and am always saying is that i am against xenophobic hate the of of closing borders, like all who come coming are terrorists, are ruish by the middle ages and i totally object to this approach.
if we can receive more, we can receive it, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not how it treat our hungarian neighbours, with bat and with seriousness.
" that's i do not agree with, " the head of the romanian executive said at a press conference in targu-jiu.
also tuesday, peter szijjarto announced that budapest has decided to start preparations on the ground for extending the fence up to the border with romania, at the border with serbia, to deal with possible change in the route used by migrants.
later, prime minister victor ponta said hungary's decision to lift a border fence resolved nothing out of the refugee problem and " takes hungary out of europe. "

according to an investigative committee, the company failed not " comply with safety norms, " the saudi news agency (spa), the bbc reported.
the company's ves were a banned from leaving the country until the investigation the case is complete.
the firm will also be to the out from new public contracts.
the construction firm is owned by the family of former leader of the al-qaeda terrorist network, osama bin laden.
the company was founded by osama bin laden's father 80 years ago and is currently headed by former terrorist leader's brother's brother.
binladen group has been working for 4 years on expansion of large mosques in order to host several pilgrims.
the crash occurred during a storm on friday evening, when a crane, probably unbalanced by the strong shelsts of wind, collapsed on the eastern part of the roof of the big mosque in mecca.

how haghaghagf shut down to disputes
considered by many romania's greatest footballer in history, gica hagi has been labelled after retiretiring, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to achieve performances in the new posture.
after unfortunate experiences with the national team, his ua or galatasaray, hagi assumed a year ago coaching role at the constanta future, a team that he heads.
set a year after taking over the team, the king demonstrated that he is capable of turning a team struggling ering to save from retrograde to a top one.
thus, a year later, the future has scored, with the hagins, 16 victories, 11 stakes and 11 defeats.
the balance sheet is one of a top team that is con on european cups.
things took an even better turn for the future this season, as the team reached second place in the 1 league, 19 points, one less than the astra giurgiu leader.
the future also has the best league league attack attack with 20 goals (on astra equality), more double double the star.
on the other hand, even though he brought several experienced players to the team, haghags continued the policy of promote young people, and in recent emerged in the start team, names such as ianis hagi or hodorogea.
the club's policy made the future a team team for teams abroad, so hagi sold 1.5m euros this summer -- ianis hagi (fiorentina -- 1m) and alexandru mitrita (bari - 500,000 euros).
along with star, the future is the only profitable team in league 1 league 1, according to trade register data.
in the refugee crisis, romania has so far played as a small country.
it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
large countries are coming with solutions for the entire eu, says cristian ghinea, member of the director college of the romanian european policy centre.
in an interview with ziare.com, cristian ghinea showed that europe could not be turned a fortress and the purely police means will not work in this crisis: " perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come to. "
but there are masses that were started and we cannot return history.
migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as best as possible and adapt them to us.
in the opinion of cristian ghinea, we are at an extremely emoemotional moment, in which politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
after he passes, europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the schengen area must be changed:' schengen is now like an animal that was created another another era and had not been adapted to the situation at now'.
where are we in the refugee crisis after this jha council which has, in fact, solved nothing?
it is clear that ec ec president in agreement with donald tusk did not want force force vote in council.
all the assertions said that they would have had the necessary votes.
before the treaty of lisbon, the principle of unanimity is applied in jha ha and any state could potentially block any decision.
that is why have been very little integrated into the area of justice and home affairs.
after lisbon, the normal procedure applies, where the council has the initiative, the council approves it with the vote of 55% of states, that is 16, to account for 65% of the eu's population.
the calculations said that the votes were there.
but they did not want to go forward.
because this is a sensitive issue, reactions of rejection appeared in germany itself against the policy of opening chancellor merkel and they did not want in many countries to appear as a reaction of the' eu sends us migrants to head'.
they have therefore deferred, but the problem remains because this wave obviously creates a huge problem for schengen governance and we will probably see great changes there in the coming period.
so, mandatory quotas were not really eliminated, but has the subject only been allowed to go ter?
yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement by frontex in the management of external borders borders, which means a change from individual responsibility of the members who are on the external border of schengen to the responsibility of community agencies.
greece's border with turkey is also germany's border with turkey de facto and this wave of migrants has set the limits to the old schengen system.
perhaps there may be waito the dublin principle that migrants are the responsibility of the country they first enter, because it is not sustainable.
if greece caits, you cannot say forever that it is greece's job.
the problem is common.
precisely because the problem is common, can it be possible without a precise, perhaps even binding, mechanism for sharing reception effort?
nobody one knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work if they comes to them.
because the problem remains problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to romania or portugal, but to sweden or germany?
i do not believe that the european states will have to take the migrants up: you go to the country x or the y y.
single filcentres will probably be reached up, greece or turkey, where asylum applications to work.
work is under way on such solutions.
but it does not have a simple solution.
they are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without no experience, like romania, where the migrant problem will increase xenophobic mainstream.
the fact is that we are about millions of people who who in turkey, in lebanon, jordan, who are in precarious camps and have just just begun heading for europe.
an estimate says that only 10% have set to leave, the winter is hard to past the mediterranean, but we expect an even even even dal wave next year.
what are we do with people?
my nonsense is that we will get get used to this problem, we will no longer at it so catastrophic from a media viewpoint.
talking by countries with less or greater experience.
does it to you that there is any place where it has really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-european culture?
i look at the maghreb maghreb in france, at the turks in germany, they are all enclaves.
i would not go moving any radical statements.
of course, their integration is more difficult than it did with other migration waves, but that does not mean it does not integrate at all.
it has remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in france, germany, the uk.
but purely police means will not work.
let us create fortress europe is illusory.
it must be done to the integration mechanisms into european societies.
there were mistakes here.
we need to be more demanding.
let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take values, to stop left on one foot in europe and with one in their country of origin, bringing bringing the rest of the family, including through marriages of convenience.
but must separate separate from the imminent issue of these people from the long-term problem of their integration.
if others have failed in long-term integration it does mean that we must look at them how they are wning in the mediterranean.
we may doubt about the quality of the values that these people come to.
and if there is an intervention in syria, which i do not think, does not mean that it will get the country overnight and take them back.
until solutions come up, we are seeing fortress within europe.
borders have been closed, walls lifted, border controls are reintroduced within the schengen area.
is the european project at risk?
the european project as such no, the schengen area as it built, yes.
it was built quite minimal and setting ing the rules so that the pressure has been too high on the countries where they put these migrants for the first time.
that is that we are moving freely from there there, but everyone is with him's problems.
in the face of such a wave cannot be possible, because some countries are not coping with.
when there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show they are doing something, but in the long term, a lot not changing.
after the attacks in france, we have no more draconian anti-terrorist legislation in the eu than we had last year.
it is a wave of public emotion that is taking installed in both ways.
and it is so unstable from one week to the next that you cannot make decisions on it.
we have a lot of talk, many rebelwary statements from politicians at home under pressure to be viral.
and then, you have the dramatic case of the child drowned in turkey and public opinion is moving.
once public emotion has passed, we will return to the reasons why we created this area, this freedom of movement which is not only for people, but also for goods.
this is the real single european market.
and i do not think europeans will give up this principle of liberty of movement.
that there will be other rules is another.
schengen is now like an animal created in another age and had not been adapted to the situation situation.
how has romania played so far in this crisis?
as a small country that believes that, if it soap on the eye and looks ens its ears, the theme is disappearing.
with the reality of the waves of migrants you can choose to be part of the solution or say it is not no problem for your small country.
that is what we did, is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
you are not, you not playing at a large country level.
large countries are come with solutions for the whole of eu, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
just as poland been done.
on the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of romanians for schengen will fall very sharply.
president iohannis says it is good that we have not entered yet.
we are therefore moving from the disperair to to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
there is of course a risk if romania and bulgaria enter schengen that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
this does not mean that it is reason to stop going into schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
romania will be part of schengen, and schengen will exist, but transformed into the sense in which external borders become common responsibility, they will be single rules for acceptance of migrants, single rules of deportation for those who do not asylum, single rules for countries regarded as safe.
the ukrainian president said that after russia moved attention to syria to ukraine no one died.
is there a link between the sites, a russian game?
russia is having a frustrated behaviour of power.
she believes that being great power means ting americans and europeans.
in this of view, yes yes there is a connection.
without the regime's military and financial effort, putin, the assad regime would have collapsed a long ago.
and it was good to collapse down before its main opponent was the islamic state.
a two years has been a battle between the assad regime and moderate secular and muslim militias, supported by the gulf countries and the west.
then the islamic state grew up and now we no longer know whether we want the assad regime to fall.
russia was able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
it creates a bed of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
but you are great power only if you also have solutions.
off-side game is just a strategy to gain time.
he is unlikely expecting bids to be made and will press the barons in order to resolve the situation.
the offers are not because the world is not convinced that he can resolve one way or other issues that he also created.
but i disagree with the theories that say that these people are eating by an invisible hand.
let us not see a little stronger than it is.
what button emerges soon
millions of facebook users have become used to the " like " button, and now representatives of the social networking network preparing another other one of " dislike. "
on tuesday, mark zuckerberg, a co-founder and executive of the company, announced on his account that this button will soon available available, the new york times reported on the blog.
zuckerberg said that the' disdis'' button will look like a nuance of what a user feels than just an option.
however, his announcement has raised the issue that facebook could become a less friendly place.
zuckerberg mentioned that he wanted to avoid a time when someone posts on his account as an important event in life and someone else will give' dislike'.
users of the network, who has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long long been to to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
mark zuckerberg also said it was not very comfortable for people to give' like' to current events such as the refugee crisis or in the case of a death of a family member.
" you may not feel comfortable that you would like it to that posting, " the facebook representative noted.
the version of a new facebook button was not welcomed by everyone.
" there is already enough rift on facebook and social networking networks, " atiq haneef of afghanistan, on the new york times facebook page, where the article on this subject was posted.
" i will give' dislike' the' dislike button', " he added.
roger anderson, a microbiologist from atlanta, claimed that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on facebook.
debra aho williamson, a social media analyst for the emarketer company, noted it was hard to imaginimagine that a butbutcan pass on a complex range of negative emotions.
moreover, she says, the election campaign in america is approaching, and the " dislike " button would create a complete disaster.
only 70 refugees went to hungary in 24 hours
hungary accepted on tuesday only 70 migrants, a handful of thousands thousands en mases at its border in the south with serbia, announced government adviser gyorgy bakondi.
hungary declared a state of emergency earlier the day in two counties along its border with serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a a main crossing point and announcing it would build a fence on its border with romania, the dpa recalls.
the move drew a sharp reaction from serbia.
just yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to request asylum.
" as you can see, this is totally different, " said serbian minister for refugees aleksandar vulin.
prior to imposing new immigration legislation, a record 5,809 migrants entered hungary on sunday, police announced on monday.
also over 170,000 immigrants from the middle east and africa entered hungary from serbia in 2015.
many avoid being registered and are trying to reach the west, especially in germany.
" the new " county council headquarters is to to typical.
two builders, in insolvency
the massive investments being made here in recent years to move the institution are to to brought down because they have been halted several times.
two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during work.
the county council council headquarters vasile alecsandri will end coming down alone.
a year and a half after strengthening and realising the building should have been completed, work has not not reached half.
a last stage in the age of the building consumed the past days, when the national dispute settlement council (cnsc) rejected a complaint by the firm that vovoia to take over the contract to realisation out the technical project for works that is still to be executed.
the original draft went by impex romcatel sa.
after the builder's insolvency and disruption of the works, negotiation procedures were started without publishing a participation announcement with impex romcatel, with the firm expected to update the technical project and then then a new tender for works will be held.
" but the negotiations did not end through a contract, with the cj assessing that the proposed form would have put the institution a disadvantage, " summarrazvan timofciuc, who represented public relations within the cj.
the cj decision to interrupt direct negotiations was attacked to court by impex romcatel.
the emerging court sent its complaint to the cnsc, which rejected it as a belar.
however, that does not mean that the ecj can start searching for another design.
impex romcatel is able to attack the cnsc decision at the appeals court, only after a final ruling could one consider considering finding another design.
thus, work to strengthen the building could resume at least next year.
our intention is to restart the work as soon as possible.
in principle, the recovery of the technical project should not take a long time, but we need to come up to a contract.
" we wait to see whether the cnsc decision will be attacked or not, " timofciuc said.
work to strengthen the former headquarters of the quaestof police began in 2011.
a first works contract was terminated in april 2012 after work of 4.5 million lei.
the tender resumed, as the contract went to moldosa.
the firm, however, entered into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payments of 1.5 million lei were paid.
work has far been done by around 50%.
initially, the consolidation ,-functionalisation and manjumon of the building was evaluated at 7.7 million lions ei.
" so, i say all! " -- a statement that could criminthe former head of the cadastre.
one of the employees involved in the scandalous file from the cadastre office signed an agreement to recognise the facts, in prison with delay.
most likely, his statements will criminalise other indictees, headed headed by the former head, narciza nedelcu.
an adviser with the cadastral and real estate advertising (cmo)) iasi charged by the dna in a corruption file has acknowledged his fap.
an agreement on recognition of the signed by dumitru ru dascalu registered at the iasi tribunal yesterday, with judges to out a solution in the case on september 29th.
dumitru daniel dascalu was charged with a false intellectual in a continued form and agreed to execute two years from chişinău with delay, as well as work serving the community.
as for the conditions of the ppp. prosecutors said that, as an adviser to the cadastral office and other colleagues claimed, " authated it in falgery several accepted minutes, the prpras the servcontracts for service contracts in the eieiera by o.c.p..iassy with the managers of the sc ss srau, sc group five srgroup, topsreuro.

tourist beany
a cluj tourist family came to iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
after the experience experienced experienced, my wife myself do not want to go any longer in your city.
without wishing to, they were up with misinformation from leaflets, by the feeling of rapt controllers and, bonus by a fine' as such the law'.
the husbands in iasi a few days ago, houstay at a hotel at the centre and called for tourist leaflets.

it is not about money, it is not overly many, but the point is that i felt deceived.
bad enough for rapists in vaslui.
accident occurred, remain preventive arrest
the trial of seven rapists in the vasyesterday moved to the iasi şlate court.
emerging judges tried the first trial trial at a non-public session where the seven young accused of shocbling an 18-year-old to be put at large.
before the actual start of the trial hearing, one of the extraordinary judges to were given the file, viorel munteanu, submitted a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues in court.
the magistrate served until this summer at at vasvas's court, where he was president of the nale station, he one who on april 9th, admitted a challenge filed by four of the indictees, placing their placement under house arrest.
currently, the dossier is tried by a complete that includes a marmagistrates to mythtelu and thinecting.
earlier, the dossier filmed ed a abstention and judge dan an ton on the grounds that his daughter was in a relationship of wedlock with one of the lawyers for the rapists.
the two judges ruled that rapists in the ship should remain under preventive detention.
ti the sistvers will remain imprisoned for least least 30 days, when juby poitors will reconsider the possibility of putting them at large.
the trial judge will take place at the iasi appeals court on october 6th.
before coming to the iasi court of appeal, the duba with which the rapists of the vaslui was involved in an accident in neighbourhood pacpacwish, the car travelling in iasi on its belt.
autoutilitara iveco with which the seven rapraptransported hit a volks wagen car driving from stradela performsing and the driver tried to plant on the left.
the duba circulates from all pacwishes.
the car went into assy here because prison administration employees preferred the route from the vassa to iasi to the stks, then on the bypass road.
they have thus shortened the road a few kilometres.
immediately after the impact, the escort detainees called for another shipment to assume the detainees.
shortly shortly, a car was sent to the crash site from the maximum est iasi safety facility, which took over the seven detainees and transported them to the appeals court.

" the incident was not reported to the police, because drivers of do ua understood amicably as to the damage that must be paid for " said chief commissioner madalin taranu, of the ipj.
the big migrations
romania is not and will not be ready for what to come.
what about europe?
i say it from the outset, clearly and clear: the 7000 refugees they should and should naturalise to romania are, in itself, an insignificant, but huge number compared with the romanian state's ability to manage such a project.
for romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by bucharest, in tune to around 1 500 soof s, goes far far beyond our good intentions of solidarity with the european union expressed in recent months.
certainly, if those migrants really accept to establish themselves in our towns, the chances of integrating them quickly into romanian society are extraordinarily small.
i am convinced that they will be the first to lose their patience.
paramby by interlosters and paralysed by an venal political class, the romanian state is proving be mired in all area.
the inability to integrate psigers is just a trivial example.
in addition, governments of any colour have not been able to absorb european funds, make roads, kindergartens or schools, to ensure decent health care, to p up the mess on the streets, create honourably paid jobs, or keep their own young generation at home.
why should refugees be established in another country from which they are fleeing?
but what causes a lot of astonement is particularly the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is being treated.
we first look at the rebelcocofatarity of the strong states of the eu, showing maximum generosity when it comes to sharing the misery with smaller countries.
then there comes the fricoous hypocrisy of romanians who, although having millions of relatives scatcattered around the world, do not yet accept the other - of a other language, from another religion, of another blood.
probably for fear of steal them careaway their national being.
ultimately, there is also the hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although invoke only the war horrors as a reason for their departure, do not accept any destination of exodus than than germany or the northern countries.
however, not all refugees refugees sysyrians and there is no war in pakistan.
also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is being considered can only be thrown in railrail.
the causes must be eliminated, i support some and, strictly playing ering the book of political correctness, they call for peace and investment for the migrants' countries of origin.
however in romania is peace, and it even enters, from time to time, some foreign capital into the national economy -- but this does not clut tens of thousands of romanians from leaving their country every year.
why are leaving?
in this crisis, the european union has been revealed to us that an anchilous, broken and out-date construction by the situation.
we deplore the fact that romania is not able to invent a country project, but here, the eu also does not have any plan for the future.
and improvisation and threats are doing nothing.
what, what is the eu, then, if the only advantage that romanians enjoy - the right to freedom of movement - could be into due to the waves of refugees crossing the borders as through cheese?
at some point, the war in syria will be over.
and not the crisis of migrants, however.
in the coming decades, over crowpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from asia and especially from africa, into a better life.
with such politicians, romania is not and will ever be ready for what to come.

two children of 9-old and 11 years of old of tomesti, brothers, swallowed allowed up several eepp pills.
they found the pills at the home and took them of curiosity.
their mother followed a treatment and the medicines were not hidden.
the children were urgently taken to the " saint maria " hospital in iasi.
they are in stable condition, as doctors say.
exclusively: a meeting that rues your heart.
20 years he received a courageous gift: biological parents
lost in hospital in unclear conditions, in denial of the 1990s, only two months of months, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a well lufamily in italy, in the same years in which adoption was vely regulated, a young woman is emerging, now now a blt and beautiful girl, remet the other day before assy with the biological parents in a village.
crina will endtain 20 years nowadays, and her adoptive parents from palermo thought to giving their daughter loving daughter an amazning and courageous present: a visit to romania, to işi to know with her unclear past.
the " iasi newspaper, " which has witnessed efforts to search the home family after after few extremely vague indices, has witnessed these meetings that which actually ruin the heart.
according to reporters, timing emotions, statements by those involved, their reactions are quite moving and overwhelming.
the drc's story begins 20 years ago in the rusty ian locality, when it was only two months.
then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to hospital, the city.
misunderstandings began at home between parents, and the mother had to go.
he has decided to stay by and to send me from home.
he stopped stopped face, and we have not known anything since.
" when i found out that he was the hospital, it was too late, " induuued alina alina, a biological mother of the girl.
crina was admitted together with her grandmother to the pascani city hospital, also then the the girl's father costica balcan left for work in the town of alexandria, teleorman county.
their lives were to break split permanently.
they unable to find crin at hospital
after his internstay, the drc's father left to work in another municipality, and returned after six months later.
meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in the assy, and the father, when he returned, did not find her.
i think they had come nearly nine months since she was in hospital.
" she have thought she had been abandoned, " tells ames an family daughter.
due to financial problems, the grandmother was unable to come in in iassy, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
because no one has taken more interest in the fate of the child throughout this time, it was taken by the directorate-general for social assistance and protection of the iasi child, which then gave it to care for the placement centre in bucium.
there were years in which abandoning and adoption were liily regulated to today in romania.
at the centre of bucium was found by the italian of salvadore and his wife, a couple from palermo, who wanted to have their child but had failed to succeed.
they fell in love with blonduta crina, and some time later they would move permanently with them to italy.
the small had already taken nearly two years, while long has took the adoption formalities.
when i saw crin, i felt it was before us.
" as if my wife gave him his life, " tells us by smiling ing salvadore, his foster father, while caught in the hands in the wiface of the girl.
in the country, crin's parents, alina and costica continued separately with their searches, each of which they could.
the father asked the in in sty sty authorities, but he received no answer where his child could be.
police then sent to them that it was possible to dead, but in iasi assy parents found out out what really happened before them.
when i looked for her here, they told me to the court that she travelled to italy, to palermo.
and conditions to looking for it i i never had.
we asked to god to be good.
i thought of it in all the years that passed, but there were no possibilities to blate, to find it.
" it's hard, " he telling telling us teareye the biological mother of ice.
but, even though years have passed, the rusty parents have not not forgotten.
in italy, salvadore and his wife explained to daughter he comes from and that her past links it with romania.
i was small when i found out.
i think that i was five or six years old.
i reacted as a copy, i was curious.
" i wanted to know my parents in romania, " confess the crrilled.
and her dream was to become a reality.
in march this year, chief commissioner romica ichim, director of the regional centre for prevention prevention, assessment, drug and counselling, was contacted with a knowledge in italy, who explained the him to salvadore's desire to find the drc's biological family.
and the search only started from one name.
after the request we had from our partners in italy, we began the first steps.
we got only one name, coastal balcan, then locality, rugsty.
shortly i had a job with the city hall hall there, and i could ask whether there was by quality the name received.
they then gave me a few indications then, only that the person found was not the person wanted.
" it took up about a month days to find out the biological father of the daughter, " chief commissioner romica ichim explains us.
in all, more than three months have taken the authorities to find costica and alina alina, especially as each was domicresident in another location.
we began steps somewhere in march, and in june-july, we completed the identification of biological parents and talks.
" then we set a first meeting to take held in september, " romica ichim added.
at the weekend that has passed, alina and costica saw for the first time their girl lost at at hospital alls in iassy hospital, 20 years ago.
the father, emoexed, could barely master his tears and his hands were passed cabessly.
it scarcely change a few words with those around.
a week before the meeting, he could not even sleep.
it was all emotional, awake.
" to see your child after so many many years, it is something, " says an granddaughter, she also also the costi, from the pray.
cr's meeting with biological mother, brother
in talks to him, who is to study at well well university university in italy, costican,, other things, that he once wants to return to him in the village, to come quiet rest: he can give him something sheep, goats ats ats, to find a, to find a boy in the village and bring l a household.
my mother is also emocited, complains, and hardly believes that this can happen to her.
i am very moved.
i did not believe that this could happen.
i have seen such cases on television, i was been thinking over these years, i hoped, but i did not think it could be the case.
these are great emotions.
if they could forforgive me.
i hope we will visit in the future.
" i hope that we can keep a bond, " says with great tears to obraalina alina, the mother of the, while keeping closely in his hands a servserde.
he is also concehiding his tears, for happiness, because he will shortly see himself with them after so bitly of time.
on the other hand, the drc, which will meet only a few days' time this month, 20, is trying to calm down like an emotive child.
he does not know what to expect, but has sketout a vague idea of her biological parents.
he think they are young people, but now before the meeting they try to gather together thoughts, because they have a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
my parents are two mothers and two fathers.
but my parents are ultimately the ones who grew up me.
it will be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
" i hope to have a nice memory with them, because now there is so much to say, " he confdes us.
first family meeting in iasi
in the unification market, under the sky beginning in the autumn, the rugsty family is again uniting their destiny with in front of them in palermo.
crina is 20 years ago, finishing high school, on the italian school model, can start a new chapter with alina and costica, her biological parents.
they no longer divide them borders or countries, but only a barrier: that of language.
over which with with the help of an translter, an local owner at central jascentre, were easily through.
those who managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first of its kind, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do so.
it is the first event of its kind, organised such an emotional charge, and i am pleased to be a success.
we at the centre have different activities, and in most cases cases we are associated as an institution that deals only with drug abusers, drug addicts.
but we are trying to give society something something good back.
" if i still asked for such an evenfield, i will do it with great de, " says smilsmiling romica ichim, director of the regional centre for prevention prevention, iasi anti-narcotics and counselling.
behind it, the balcan family, crin in the middle, departaway from telling.
i am understandable: they have a lot to tell each other.
a truce with the weapons on the leg yesterday in the psd.
everyone res their soul.
camps in the eastern branch of the psd ended a gunceasefire on the leg.
after successive rounds of talks, from friday to sunday, the first first the most tense one, psd leaders agreed to temporarily suspend the hostilities.
pressed by the party's executive president, liviu dragnea, to present a united position, emerging social democrats will send him a whole list of potential candidates for the party's posts.
far from having over, the internal war in the party seems to have only taken a pause to allow combatants to drag their soul.
dragnea has not put out an ultimatum.
it has sent a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: are trying to find a solution as not to jeopardise the party.
on 3 october we have party elections.
all functions will be made available to those who will like them.
" until then we remain in the existing structure, " said interim mayor mihai chirica.
the two days of weekend talks led led to the conclusion that nothing certainty has been established.
in the october elections, for the president of the psd's county branch stifff competition is expected.
on the short list of possible candidates for the top post's the party are secretary secretary of maricel popa, senator florin constantinescu, senator sorin lazar, assistant counselor vasile catea ea and the secretary of state of the county council, victorel lupu.
this could also be by the mayor of a schitu duca, mihai mihalache.
one option under consideration is the candidacy of psd county councors leader cristian stanciu, should lupu no longer proceed in the race, with party sources saying he is no interested in the post.
the only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants the negotiations over the recent days is that of former leader of the branch, mayor gheorghe nichita.
the list of candidates is open.
under the statute, including on election day, candidates can be filed, and would not surprise anyone if they happened.
" the important is that we remain united, and we will stay after october 3rd, when we have a new executive office, a new permanent office, and all new leadership structures, " she said.
until the internal elections are held, the leadership of the psd county branch will be assured by victorel lupu, a close to nichita and stanciu.

contacted by phone, cristian stanciu has praised the talks in recent days as leading to a " partial consensus. "
there is broad willingness to maintain the balance and unity within the party.
a partial consensus was reached to support a unitary team to deal with the county.
" but on the other hand, there are several variations regarding intentions related to candidacy for the iasi psd presidency, with the list remains open, " stanciu commented.
retired judge denies on vas's rap' file over concucompetition
the seven young people in convic's vasof county county today reaching the iassy appeals court.
vasluians sentenced to sentences between five years to eight months to eight years to four months will present their arguments about putting them at freedom, after the court of substance, judge of vaslui, has established their imprisonment immediately after serving the sentence.
the file was registered at the appeals court last week, with magiate dan anton drafting a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
anton cited that one of the defendants' attordefendants, lawyer bogdan luca, is the concucompetition of his daughter, lawyer dana anton.
luca is defending silviu ovidiu burada, who was received the highest sentence in this dossier.
how did judges motivated the sentence
late last week, the vaslui magistrmagistrate who sentenced the seven young people motivated the sentence.
for is why the judge talks about the brazfireaction of the defendants, but also those who supported them, pointing out that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public public.
" the court finds that after being placed preventive judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not freedom, under the impact of the attitude of defendants, families, families and supporters, was felt at the local and national community, a strong feeling of indignation over the the fact that persons accused of serious acts are tried to a less restrictive extent, " said to motivthe vas's judge.
the magistrates also dismantled the main defence of the seven indictees who during the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be " the door to church. "
" the court states that the moral quality of the injured person is unrelevant, an aspect the defendants wanted to highlight through the defence they have formulated because the physical and sexual freedom of a injured person cannot be infringed on any pretext, " it further states in motivation.
corbyn, brexit and the future of europe
for economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past decades cannot continue to continue the same in the coming years.
until saturday, there probably little world in romania who jeremy corbyn was.
even today, after he became the new leader of the uk labour party, many are wondering how much we can affect affect the election of a politician who, after all, is in a decision-making position.
jeremy corbyn is the most radical leflabour leader of post-war labour.
marxist said, anti-monarchist (once asked tony blair then the prime minister to to the royal family out of the buckingam palace), an fer@-@ american anti-american and sympathiser vladimir putin (vladimir putin (has also been regularly invited to comment on the television channel, " russia today "), and the re@-@ american terrorist movements, hizbollah and hamas.
for corbyn, who at the time the killing of osama bin laden as a real tragedy, esis almost preferable to the united states.
along the lines of all populist demagogues, corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
things of the kind as those they said and promised and tsipras in greece until such time it it ed with the real world and economic ties.
the economic programme of the new labour leader envisages, among other things, massive renationalisation and to printing money as a solution for the financing of development projects and cover cover very generous social benefits.
of course, some might ask why the solution in printing printing money is not unanimously adopted across the globe, we would then have overall global prosperity!, but who will shcluitself itself from such details.
of course, we can tax bankers to blood, become become a of service enemies of the left, but as we have seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in ecuador or venezuela, but also, but also in france, at the, at the beginning of the mandates of mitterand and hollande.
the additional sums are quickly swmed by the generous, uncover promises made by populist demagogues.
as margaret thatcher's attention rightly, " the problem of socialism is that at one point, others' money ends'.
few give real chances for jeremy corbyn to to reach prime minister.
in the early 1980s, another radical leader on the left, michael foot, who was not as highly in in case as the party's new leader anyway, failed lamenterably in the elections.
and then there is still a labour class in britain, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
and the unions were been sensitive more influential than now.
given the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant dominant the the force, and extensive automatiation have led the industry in a massive need for highly qualified workpower, corbyn's rhetoric has a limited call.
but, even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
in its latest financial times number believes that the election of corbyn increases the chances of brexx, which is britain's exit from the eu.
the new labour leader has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the union.
in the eyes of the radical left, brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that imposed austerity on the poor.
when you combine this kind of ideas with those by the radical right, anti anti immigration immigration and look at the refugee refugee crisis is shaking on the foundations of the eu end to an explosive mix.
and not just for britain.
but if the british decide after the referendum, which would be held by 2017, to leave the loss of symbolic capital for the entire european project and the deep ruins created within by the euro crisis, and now that of refugees refugees, the north and south, between the east and the and west, leaving leaving room for scenarios of the most worrying.
all the more so because for a whole of member states, london was a counterbalance to the franco-german axis (in which berlin is increasingly becoming the dominant actor).
it is true, british business, city, are powerful lawyers of the country's remaining in the eu.
but europe today is no longer that of the past.
there are many resentment, which are are growing in intensity in these very weeks.
the problem is that brussels, we recently had a sample in the speech by jean cluj de junker, is tinclined to take major decisions over the head of the large majority of the member states in consultations with only a few european powers, mainly with germany.
and is is when electoral support for the anti-system anti-immigration immigration ations which are at the time time eurosceptic is increasing dramatically throughout the entire continent.
in other words, the emotional negatively laden emotional climate has reached rates higher than ever in the past.
hence and the conclusion that the financial times draws when assassessing the chances of fibres.
the pro-eu option is based on a cold calculation that moves from the national interest.
if voters make their brain decision, then britain will remain in the eu.
but corbyn's victory reminds us of the strength of emotion in current politics.
however, eastern europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
especially if, as is, we are to see greater integration of the euro area, which will push most of the states in the region and on the periphery of interest and the decision-making process in europe.
corbyn, tsipras and syriza in greece, the podemos in spain, even bernie sanders in the united states are fuelling their populist rhetoric from the frustrations it are accumulated in-@-@ dental societies.
for economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed over recent decades, the generous social benefits, cannot no longer continue so in the coming years.
under explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the euro area - immigration both caused by hasty decisions that took only only integrationist political ambitions, not the capacity and availability of the peoples and governments of europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent that took into account internal tensions in the eu will increase more intensity and can seriously affect romania's situation.
and it is difficult to exclude something in terms of possible scenarios.
the question is whether our main political leaders are in a position to deal with such complicated situations.
constantin brancusi, the god of taran.
rockefeller: " how can i help? "
brancusi: " take and mature the workshop! "
the great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to get famous, to hear about him around the world.
behind his renowned, however, there is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are supplied us, recipes for success in life.
that also has a name.
they call'' uda'.
what to write about constantin brancusi?
what is to said, in fact?
his figure was appeared in notes.
and recently, a known bank of romania has been hired an actor to play it in a advertising customer.
brancusi produces and supplies almost 60 years after it is not with us.
in romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards who bear his name.
in fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
and, when it goes out with rasly, you hear the following instructions:' we go into the park, brancusi'.
the country is replinted with its statues.
there are few romanian figures whose works are known to so world from their children to the elderly.
brancusi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
the communists too, failed to extiate out of romania's memory and culture.
its quotquotations today imer the internet, having receiving hundreds of thousands of talas and share.
and again, then, what it be said to writing about this man?
viewed from a pile of books and articles that seek to reconstitute their destiny, bran's life life seems almost unfantastic, totally unlikely.
you know, there are those people who tell you that if you did not had the fortune to give born in any big town and in a family as well as as ent, your chances of success in life are almost none.
brancusi's life is perfect contraexample.
perhaps it would be be key here.
perhaps the text text ahead should be from from here.
with a sentence, however detestable they are.
you forget the success stories you create, which are delivered to you every day to the newspapers and television.
take a close look at the faces of this man.
do you want to know how he has succeeded, how,, today, he has heard a whole world?
it is perfectly simple.
he worked his life to be someone.
that is it did.
constantin brancusi is born on 19 february 1876 in hobita, a small village in the a common,, gorj county at foot of the carpathians.
it is fifth child of maria and radu nicolae brancusi.
although he came from a well pling family, brancusi leads a modest life, but one which had to reap the remarks that will guide his late artistic vision.

everything was quiet from one seastime to another.
and do you know why things have changed?
the civilisation of the great city has reached us.
but brancusi's childhood was far from idillic.
one of the moments in these first years of life is highly suggestiof the combination of purity and violence that that characterised ised her of sculptsculptor years spent in their native ity.

in the evening, when father radu returns from living with lautari, he sees from away away the desperate signs of those who strongly await him at his mouth.

while the boy is allowed to slele his beer, bejojoy, the co@-@ ed party continues even more force.

currently city city is not function
an mp calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
independent deputy viorel blajut called on the psd and pnl to stop their infighting and to refocus their agenda towards the electorate.
what we now see on our political stage is a great division, and that.
we have seen nothing of the usl projects in 2012 to continue.
neither the highway nor the regional hospital for emergencies, see see politicians dispute their possible sites in line to estate interests.
let us leave a little political aside, sit together and talk.
currently, the city is not working.
" if you are occupied with the internal war, you have no time for those who chose you, " blajut said.
he assessed that the current political class has left emerging voters disappointed, the result of very low low in the upcoming local local elections, around the 30% figure, effectively representing the parties' faithful electorate.
the deputy also believes that voters will also look to traditional parties, expressing his reservations over new political initiatives, such as the party " for iassy " that will be launched today.
local parties have a very slim chance and will only wip out from the electorate of the right, rather than the psd.
such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually quite right.
" the right right is further woling themselves, which is not good for anyone, not for the psd, " blajut said.
he added that he is not interested in a candidacy for the upcoming local elections, refuting rumours of his intention to join the mayoral race.
i also said i do not want to run for any local office.
i also consider whether whether to continue as an member and in the next term.
i have tried to call for unity for the iassy and in the cafe discussions, with the other parliamentarians, and i have been accused of wanting to give my image.
i do not want, but we cannot go on like that.
" if people voted us, it doesn't mean they are fools voting for us if they see anything, " said blajut, who assessed that the main reason why the electorate no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the alps.
a colleague from tatarasi said that he doesn not get his money and has to go by bus.
let us not be hypocritical.
there is not little money.
sometimes i am ashamed to raise the money from the casty.
at the end of my mandate, i will make a report with i have spent, apart from the salaries of cabinet employees and its maintenance.
i just that to raise in one month's time and 30,000 lei, with all transport disaccounts, accommodations and the others.
" tell one mp that he doesn't get his money is clean hypocrisy, " ended blhelp.
