un chief says there are no military solutions in syria
secretary-general ban ki-moon says his response to russia's military support for syria is that " there is no military solution " to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
the un chief again urged all sides, including the divided un security council to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
ban said at a conference on wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present in the council -- us, russia, china, england and france -- on the sidelines of the general assembly ministerial session to discuss syria.
ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the syrian people and the regional powers " have made this unsolvable. "
ban called on the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on iran's nuclear weapons, addressing the crisis in syria.
8 poll figures show donald trump has a real chance
some have tried to label it as a " flip-flop " politician.
others called a joke.
and others implosion.
but regardless of how some republicans try to bring down donald trump from the top of the polls, it has not worked (yet).
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that donald trump leads a double-digit, and some voices are starting to seriously wonder what this means for the chances of appointing real estate mogul.
it is, of course, still premature.
none of this says that trump will win the race for nominating the republicans.
pundits shows that, during the same period of 2011, rick perry's advancement made room for herman cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
and the reasons for fighting hard in the general elections are numerous.
but outside groups such as jeb bush's super cap and the conservative club for growth group recognise trump's power and are starting to support it with money.
we are still presenting to you some figures from recent polls that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing occurrence:
figures showing support for trump have returned to 180 degrees.
even before donald trump announced his candidacy, in mid-june, a poll by the university of monmouth showed that only two out of 10 republicans had a positive view of real estate mogul.
by mid-july, the percentage had climbed to 40%.
in early august, it was 52 per cent.
currently, six out of 10 republican republics have a favourable view of donald trump.
about three out of 10 say they disagree.
these figures remain.
a poll conducted last week by quinnipiac in iowac concluded that 60% of the republicans in the region have a favourable opinion of trump.
two thirds of gop voters would be happy if trump won the nomination race.
in a poll carried out by cnn / orc last week, 67% of the republicans said they would be " excited " or " satisfied " if the trump were to win the race for a nomination.
only two out of 10 say they would be " upset " if trump won the nomination race.
only ben carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as trump (43% says he would be " enthusiastic " about 40% saying the same about trump).
the closest in terms of enthusiasm?
marco rubio with 21%.
on the other hand, 47% of republican voters say they would be " dissatisfied " or " angry " if the favourite jeb bush wins the nomination race.
most republicans do not consider trump's temperament a problem.
although donald trump has been strongly criticised for his insults and his bombastic style, 52% of republican voters across the country believe the real estate mogul has the right temperature for president, according to a poll abc news / washington post on monday.
we find the same figures in the state of iowa, where 52% of the republicans believe that trump has the right personality to lead, according to the poll conducted last week by quinnipiac.
however, 44% believe he does not have the personality personality to act effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperature has no place at the white house, according to the abc / post.
republican voters are used to the idea.
when they take the attitude of intellectuals, republican voters consider trump authentic.
according to a poll conducted by cnn / orc last week, the question of who is most likely to win the race for gop nomination, four out of 10 said the trump.
the situation has changed since late july, when four out of 10 would bet on jeb bush.
complete information: in the past, gop voters have not read the future very well.
during the same period of last elections, four out of 10 republics chose rick rick perry for only 28% for mitt romney.
however, these figures show that the majority of gop voters see trump's campaign as plausible.
even though the republicans or inconvenient to another candidate; trump still leads us all.
some say the divided situation will likely contribute to trump's victory, while support for trump will split into more than a dozen candidates.
but in early september by the university of monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of collaboration between trump and most of the other republican candidates, almost always trumtrump will receive majority support.
trump is 13 points from carly fiorina, at 14 marco rubio, at 15 points of walker, at 19 points of jeb bush and, finally, 33 points each from the line paul, john kasich and chris christie.
it is almost equal with ted cruz.
is the only candidate who defeats him?
ben carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical to one confrontation.
most of donald trump supporters say they have decided.
a new poll tuesday by cbs / nyt shows that more than half of voters supporting trump say it does not change their choice.
obviously, a great deal can happen about this, and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say that it leaves the door open to change its option.
however, trump's most important adversarsary is currently the neurosursurgeon ben carson, but it is doubly likely that voters who say that they have decided to vote with the trump.
six out of 10 republicans say they agree with trump on the immigration issue.
since donald trump called immigrants from mexico " rapists " in his opening speech to his campaign two months ago, immigration has been central to the campaign for 2016.
some are concerned that trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between major hispanic voters and the republican party and will damage efforts at rebranding.
but according to the abc / post survey on monday, six out of 10 republicans say they agree with trump on immigration.
so it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so doland trump will remain.
frustration with the authorities is reaching new cules.
donald trump and ben carson are now backed by almost half of the republican voters, largely because of their status as dissent.
according to the poll conducted monday by abc / post, six out of 10 republicans say they prefer a political outsider at the expense of someone with government experience.
people also upset washington.
a poll two weeks ago in iowa by des moines register / bloomberg shows that three of four yowa republics are frustrated with the performance of congress republican republics, with 54% declaring themselves " unhappy " and 21% " nervous and slees. "
jeremy corbyn makes debut at prime ministry's questions
since his election, mr corbyn debut in pmqs has long awaited
the new leader of the labour party, jeremy corbyn, will later make his debut at the prime ministry's questions, facing david cameron for the first time.
mr corbyn will ask the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after noon; his performance is likely to be closely examined by the media and labour mps.
in his weekly appearances, he called for " less theatre and more deeds. "
he also said he can give up several participations and give in to his colleagues.
the confrontation will be the first parliamentary test of mr corbyn as leader, coming after naming a' phantom cabinet' and his speech at the annual tuc congress tuesday.
meanwhile, the decision by the labour of the labour party to remain silent at the national anthem's news at a service held on tuesday on the 75th anniversary of the battle of england has drawn criticism from some conservative mps and has made the headlines.
mr corbyn's decision not to sing national anthem drew attention
a spokesman for mr corbyn said that he' kept silent respectfully' and recognised the' heroism of the british air forces in the battle of england'.
but a fantoma cabinet member of mr corbyn, owowen smith, told the two's newsnight show broadcast by the bbc that he had advised the labour leader certising the national anthem " regardless of " his belief that monarchy should be abolished.
around a dozen ministers in the fantoma cabinet refused to be part of mr corbyn's leading team, arguing with differences of opinion about the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as its leader.
bbc political correspondent rorobin brant says policy differences " unite " in the labour party after mr corbyn was appointment about his position towards the eu and the benefit limit.
mr corbyn said at the tuc conference that the labour party would make changes to eliminate the idea of limiting completely.
a few hours later, mr smith, the minister for labour and pensions, said the party' is very clear' in exclusive opposition to the government plans to reduce the level of' head' from 26.000 to 23.000.
mr corbyn will be the fifth labour leader facing david cameron in the gallery in the last decade since he took over the conservative party.
the labour leader, who has pledged a different approach to the policy, says that he has ideas' from foreign sources' for questions to put to mr cameron and that he has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
parliament member islington north said pmqs involves too high a level of confrontation and would refrain from reshocks and attacks, committing itself to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
mr corbyn said that angela eagle, the finance minister, will take her place in pmqs when he cannot take part for example, when mr cameron moves abroad.
he also expressed that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying he has dealt with chamber of deputies president john bercow to discuss the issue.
in 2005, when he took the lead, mr cameron stated that he wanted to give up the' punch and judy' political style often associated with pmqs, but acknowledged a few years later that he failed to do so.
since the first transmission, in 1990, the pmqs has been considered to be a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, of the way in which it heads the chamber of deputies and its position among fellow members members of parliament, although critics say that it has become a caricature and that it is in need of profound reform.
'framework for jobs': homeless youth receive photo courses
it is difficult to be a homeless man in johannesburg.
but a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way of learning a profession and earn a living.
" i was shot in job ton' is a non-profit studio teaching homeless young people to take photos of areas where they live and earn money from it.
the bbc news met with one of the project's first graduates.
head of jd sports says higher salaries are harmful to enlargement
president jd sports peter cowgill says a minimum wage increase in the united kingdom could mean " a higher purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers. "
however, the purchasing power is unlikely to surpass the higher labour costs in the firm, he says.
the costs could have an impact on jd sports's enlargement plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
tennis australia thanasi kokinakis steve healy
thanasi kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticised for his behaviour.
thanasi kokkinakis was the collateral victim in the " storlstorm " created around his friend, nick kyrgios, and his behaviour rather deserves words worthy of praise and does not criticism, in the opinion of tennis australia president steve healy.
kokkinakis, the youngest part of the talented duoften called " special ks, " was uneasantly dragged in the light of the spotlight by the scandalous derathage that kyrgios had towards stan wawrinka at the montreal masters tournament.
in a fiding qualification match he played played shortly after, within five years, the referee of the chair had to intervene twice in order to split up kokkinakis and his adversarer ryan harrison, after which harrison said: " wawrinka should have put his kyrks and i should put his land.
although he was last seen making a dust missile after having crampe muscular and missed a possible us open tournament, angered richard gasquet, kokinakis, was firmly defended by healy.
the teenagis currently in glasgow, where he fights sam groth for second place after bernard tomic in the davis cup semifinal against england.
" one thing i feel strongly is that in my opinion, thanasi was attracted a bit into conflict, " healy said.
the truth is that he tore a rocket when he lost because he accused crampe in us, but is not the first player to break a rocket from frustration with himself and know thanasi well enough to know that he would not be proud of it.
but let us be serious, it has managed extremely well in quite challenging situations in us with harrison and so on and i think it deserves a lot of trust.
she has an extraordinary team, she has a great family and i think it has been treated unfairly.
he is a 19-year-old young man, is working hard and has joined the team, he has had no conflict with the other players, he is very respected in the news, trained hard, is in an excellent form, is a very balanced and mature young man and i think he deserves to be judged solely on his qualities and shortcomings.
healy also supported the decision not to take into account kyrgios for his important recount game, which starts on friday, and described the " joint decision " as the most appropriate for all, but supported the return of the player originally from canberra in the long term to the team.
" first of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the recount match, and not to think not at all about the controversy around [kyrgios], " the healy said.
and i think nick has up very quickly, as people like federer rer murray said, he matures under the eyes of the public and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticised, but we are trying to support him, helping him him understand the consequences of his deeds and i think he needs a time in which he cannot reflect, good for both his team and team.
elections 2016: the advantage of hillary clinton to bernie sanders has shrunk by half in the national polls
former secretary of state hillary clinton still has a two-digadvantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but senator bernie sanders is gaining ground.
clinton is now backed by 47% of the democratic voters (down from 58%), while sanders is second, with 27% (up up from 17%).
vice-president joe biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is backed by 15% of democratic voters.
at least five months before the start of primary elections, the majority of democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
but clinton's supporters are more resolute in their choice than the proponents of other candidates.
compared to the cbs news poll last month, clinton has lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while sanders won several percentage points.
clinton maintains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has subsided.
male support has been diminished considerably, and sanders is a distance of just 5 points away.
clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and is now on a par with sanders.
however, clinton still has advantage among elderly voters.
last month, clinton was before sanders with a two-digit, among the liberals, but sanders now has a slight 5-point advantage in this group.
about half of the national democratic voters say they would enthusiastically back clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
a quarter would keep it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
six per cent would not support it.
perhaps unsurprising, the probability that clinton's current supporters will be enthusiastic about her election is high.
opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
while 48% of the democratic voters say they would enthusiastically back clinton, the number of republican voters who say the same about first, donald trump (35%) is lower.
when clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has adequate experience (16%), followed by the time for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the post (10%).
clinton's proponents also mention her association with bill clinton (9%).
the agreement on these aspects and eligibility is also mentioned.
as the vice-president is considering a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third think they should not have to run.
on the question of the second option for the party's representative, democratic voters in majority call biden.
of clinton's supporters, more than half say that biden would be the second option, well ahead of sanders.
if biden decides not run for the democratic party race, hillary clinton's advantage over sanders increases, from 20 points with biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of democratic voters see clinton as the most likely candidate to win the general election; but the numbers have dropped from 78% last month.
biden is second, but the percentage that he is most eligible has increased.
however, when asked what is the most important candidate for an elected candidate, the democratic voters prefer issues instead of eligibility.
as last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters as unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well as regards several key features to their party's primary voters.
most voters see clinton, sanders and biden as integrated and trustworthy and with solid qualities of leadership.
biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity, while clinton's strength is the leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not believe that h. clinton is integrated and reliable, twice as many as those who say so about sanders (15%), but 27% have no view on it.
democratic voters also believe that the three, clinton, sanders and biden, have the same ideologies as they.
on all of these issues, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of the sanders.
as the questions persist on the use of an email personal address and servserver by hillary clinton when she was secretary of state, the majority of democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation on the subject, and say she has not affected their general opinion on the candidate.
however, things are different among the us public.
half of the americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about one-third are satisfied.
public opinion was divided in march on the issue, shortly after the issue came to light.
most of the americans say the controversy over e-mail has not affected their general opinion on clinton, even though 36% say they have changed their mind.
mainly the republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their mind on clinton in the negative sense.
although democratic voters see clinton as integrated and reliable, this continues to raise issues among voters globally: only 32% consider it integrated and reliable, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in may.
sixty per cent of voters do not integrate it with trust.
at the same time, 55% of domestic voters do not consider trump integrally, and trustworthy.
however, both clinton and trump are white on leadership.
of the six evaluated candidates, biden, carson and bush are ranked first in terms of integrity.
the number of those who consider sanders integrer is higher than those who disagree but, as with carson, many have no opinion on him.
the margin of error for the 351 primary democratic voters' sample is 6 percentage points.
five members of the brotherhood charged with the murder of student in year 1 at the baruch faculty
nearly two years after a university student died during an initiation ritual in the pocono mountains in pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
members of the pi brotherhood delta psi of the new york-based baruch faculty have brutally assaululted chun " michael " deng during an initiation ritual in september 2013, and have it to take it to hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police.
official sources say the victim was tied to the eye, he was given a a 14 kg kg bag bag in his backbag full of the sand and has been bullied repeatedly as he tried to go towards a target target on an frozen field.
mr deng has accused headache and lost his knowledge.
members of the delta psi brotherhood did not call emergency numbers after he fainted and claimed to have waited an hour before taking it to hospital, police say.
however, they found the time needed to change deng's clothes, seek the symptoms of google and contact andy meng, president of the brotherhood at the national level, to seek his advice, police chief chris wagner said at a press conference.
" at this point, members have started hiding personal goods and have practically put the good of the brotherhood before michael deng's good, " wagner said.
it could not be resuscitated and died the next morning.
according to an autopsy report, deng has suffered repeated traumas, trunchi and coapses.
" too many families have been devastated by the fr' rituals, since 1970 at least one student lost their lives every year due to rituals, " douglas fierberg, deng's family's lawyer, said in a statement.
their brotherhood and their members must be held accountable and this step taken by the authorities is important.
the monroe district grand jury recommended that the first five be charged with third-degree crime.
thirty-two other brotherhood, including mr meng, will also be charged for ultratras and complicity in the murder.
" we want to hold accountable not only those involved but, if there is an organisation that has authorised the brotherhood, officially or informally, we will hold it to account, " wagagner said at a press conference tuesday.
the baruch faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
that is what will happen when the federal reserve increases interest rates.
the interest rate will increase and the bull market (growing market) will be ticky, the return on bonds will increase and the economy will go into recession.
we know.
what we do not know is how long it will happen and how long it takes.
in the economy, history offers little indication of timing.
after the first interest rate increase, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
the aggressiveness of the federal reserve to raise interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
that is why us central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on a time when they are starting to raise interest rates but on the path of the time needed to normalise.
there are indeed many variables at stake.
but at the end of the day, the market players might see that all the fuss about interest-rate growth has been blown.
" the first interest rate increase decided by the edf after the world financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of " cheap money age, " julian jessop, chief economist at capital economics, said in a note to customers.
on the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of us interest rates to more normal, but still low levels to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
however, it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
we are still putting forward how a few sectors of the economy could react, on the basis of historical trends:
in view of the situation that the market has faced in recent months, the anticipation of an interest rate increase may volatile things for some time.
but at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
" it seems there is a tendency for the return of capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which perhaps perhaps again the breakdown in monetary policy, " deutsche bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the edf increases.
specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has suddenly increased - by around 14 per cent - moving towards an interest rate increase, quite invariable over the 250 days period after (average tracup of 2.6%) and then it returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return in six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis on barron by the chief strategy of asset management.
deutsche said that the impact on actions tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle, and the benefits are beginning to decrease.
the recession is a reality of economic life, but raising the interest rate often contributes to it.
in the current situation, the edf faces conditions that have not existed before and which could accelerate a recession.
to be precise, the gross domestic product will come closer to its historic minimum point for an increase in the edf interest rate.
according to deutsche bank, out of the 118 interest rate increases after 1950, only twice the roll-call gdp was less than 4.5%.
even though in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to edf atlanta.
raising the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question " whether it is different this time, " deutsche said.
the market players also prepared the year for a growth decision from the edf, with all eyes focused at this week's meeting of the federal open market commission, which ends on thursday.
although many strategists and economists believe that fomc could approve an increase in the interest rate during this meeting, short-term transactions indicate that only 25% are likely.
" in our study conducted after 1950, all interest rate growth cycles so far have been in a super cycle of growth of profit, with gdp eclipding the peaks before the recession very quickly after the recovery began, " the report said.
on the contrary, this has been a bikward amount of slow recovery after the most serious recession in the period under consideration.
the current cycle is by far the longest expected by the edf since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it has reached 74 months and continues.
the fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate, and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
the main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of actions when the edf changes the policy.
in the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits are changing direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs.
at the end of the interest rate growth cycle, bond returns is falling immediately, " deutsche said.
strategies charles schwab believe that these interest rate increases will bring the return to profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, while wing the pace.
high-paid bonds perform better in such an environment, although " we are still wary of forcing the profitability, " kathy jones, a fixed income analyst within schwab, said in an analysis.
interestingly enough, jones is of the opinion that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of the edf policy.
" besides the dollar's strength and lowering expected inflation, there are several signs that the market has adapted to a more rigorous monetary policy, " jones wrote.
short-term interest rates have increased, the flow of profitability is fairer, the average credit interest rate spread has widened and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the edf tightens the policy.
by and large, majority companies operating in the us will benefit from an interest rate increase, and local products will become more attractive.
the heavily indebted multinationals will suffer because increasing the dollar will result in their products becoming more expensive in the area of the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
" history shows that " quality " stocks tend to be made more profitable in the three months in the wake of an initial increase in the interest rate, " analyst goldman sachs said in a report to the clients.
strong balance shefirms surpassed those with a poor balance after each of the interest-rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
companies with high capital revenues and low volatility stocks have also surpassed similar low-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 percentage points), respectively.
debt will become an important issue.
companies with a large percentage of flolower debt have the most to lose, goldman says.
consumers will also benefit from increasing the dollar.
savers may also stand to benefit, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
bbc radio 3 a copy after classic fm, says parliament member andrew bingham
conservative mp andrew bingham criticised radio for " silating "
he says it increasingly similar to commercial adversarer
he also eyes bbc music awards with brits awards
colleague damien collins attacked the voice, calling it not original either
bbc radio 3 is " turning into " fm classic, a senior lawmaker said, putting pressure to prove he is doing something they do not do.
conservative mp andrew bingham also told the bbc leaders that public radio station " prosils " and increasingly resembles the trade opponent.
" i have the impression that radio 3 " sils " although i do not like to use the word -- but i feel it is turning into fm classic ics, " he said.
he also took the bbc music awards into the eye, which was launched last december.
the bbc music awards, launched last year seems to be brits under another name.
so if you try to do something different -- these are the two examples coming to mind that only copy what already exists on the market, " said mr bingham.
the bbc director-general denied the accusations, saying the bbc radio 3 is well ahead of its trading opponent when it comes to live music and public education.
i will not find out anywhere about classical music coming from radio 3.
and his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
" furthermore, i think the commitment of radio 3 to discover new music and the allocation of new plays is also important, " he said.
in the first part of this year, bbc radio 3 editor alan davey said he had to do more to attract an audience from the previous period because the british have less knowledge of classical music.
but radio 3 was not the only element under the bbc logo at a meeting of the committee on culture, the media and sports for following the footsteps of its trade rivals.
conservative mp damien collins attacked the voice - the bbc's talent show from dutch producer talpa media for around gbp 22 million.
do you understand why there is often talk about that issue because it is not original and does not distinguish itself by anything?
lord hall insisted that the show made by bbc1 - bearing the paloma faith faith and boy george in juriu - be carried out' in a bbc-specific manner'.
he added that he wants the corporation " to find gold eggs in its own ooph " next time it launches an entertainment show.
however, he refused to ban in the future the taking over of new seasons from the voice or to spend money on licences on other entertainment formats.
internet sales register lowest in august, with black friday
in the first three months of 2015, online sales have increased by 7%.
there has been the most slow growth since 2000 last month.
online sales have gained momentum three years ago due to the use of the mobile phone to buy.
experts say the november black friday may cause reticence to expenses.
for more than a decade, online shopping has rocketed and turned the commercial streets of great britain into fanhost cities.
but specialists say there are signs that online sales are declining, with the latest figures indicating a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
the total amount of money spent in august showed the lowest growth since 2000, with an increase of only 5 per cent over the last year.
specialists say there are signs that online sales are declining, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
" if we look at the level of growth in previous years, and we are going back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalise time, " andy mulcahy, editor of the imrg index, told the guardian.
he explained that online sales picked off three years ago, when buyers started using the mobile phone to shop.
in this way, the number of people who were able to make online purchases increased and do so under different circumstances, such as on the canea.
but now that it is stagnating a little, you could see a decline (in growth).
the phenomenon of black friday, imported from america, is cited as one of the reasons for falling sales.
in the opinion of the specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases ahead of the event in the last friday in november.
last year, five times the average number of buyers jammed in front of computers to put hands on offerings, which led to the collapse of websites of several retailers.
specialists say that black friday, when buyers prangled on bargains, could make shoppers less reluctant.
a survey by the british retail consortium determined that at least 1 lira out of every 5 lira is spent online.
in the case of certain products such as televisions and washing cars, more than a third of the purchases are currently carried out via online shops.
at the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy online clothes and shoes rather than turn to fashion shops in commercial areas.
after sanctions ing the bin laden family, muslims bury victims killed by the collapse of crcrane in mecca
the bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked in the streets of muslims, with the first funeral taking place in mecca.
saudi arabia has partly blamed the construction giant saudi binladin group for collapse.
health minister says a total of 394 injured as crashed
in the street stking ceremony, hundreds of muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crcrane at the large mosque in mecca.
dressed in white, those who complained of death joined on the road to express their condolences until the first dead reached the end of the final journey at the al-moaissem cemetery.
the sad memory kept by the holy place, where only a few days ago, a construction cry collapsed through the mosque's tavy, with a stay of believers.
the bodies were released for the funeral after saudi arabia's king sanctioned the bin laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also resulted in 394 injured.
at the ceremony on the street, hundreds of muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed as a result of a crcrane at the large mosque in mecca.
the victims included the father of four children qasim akram, from bolton, great manchester, in his first pilgrimage when cranes collapsed.
mr akram is in the great mosque with his parents before the start of the hajj pilgriinage annually.
saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrigrimage in mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still in the city.
today, king salman said that the binladin group should not have left the arm of the maccranes when cranes was not in operation.
an arab version of the decree published by the saudi news agency said the binladin group is partly responsible for the collapse.
the news agency's english service did not reveal that detail, but said the company's leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
earlier this week, salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the crarane in the big mosque, where hundreds of thousands of muslims came before the hajj pilgrige later this month.
the binladin group has not yet spoken about the collapse of the cranes, and group representatives could not be contacted for statements.
the royal decree blamed the group for failing to use up-to-date safety measures and to co-ordinate its work with the weather authorities.
dozens of cranes round the large mosque in mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the binladin group.
for decades now, the binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of saudi arabia, and major construction projects are under way.
the last qaeda leader, osama bin laden, was a " reneged, " disinherited by the family in the 1990s.
the collapse took place under strong wind conditions and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, an essential journey at once in the lives of every muslim bearing physical weight.
authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
the authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased victims receive one million saudi ones (gbp 174,000) and the same amount should be paid to those with permanent injuries.
other injured will receive half of that amount.
the advantages, disadvantages of swiss franc conversion
two offers to convert credit into swiss francs have already appeared on the banking market, with the main benefits being to exclude currency risk and reduce rates.
the drawbacks can come in a few years' time, when variable interest can lead to an increase in rates.
the transylvania bank has just completed the credit conversion process in francs granted by volksbank, and the post has announced the conversion offer for its own clients.
according to data cumulated by analysts at the financial portal finzoom, the post offers three years of fixed interest at the lei, at 1.5 per cent, the lowest on the market.
on the other hand, the transylvania bank's conversion offer was accepted by 83 per cent of customers with credit in francs due to two successive cuts: the soil has been reduced to the fees of risk and administration paid by the customer, then an additional 22.5 per cent reduction in the lei was applied.
both offers lower their own customer rates, compared to what they paid monthly equivalent to lei before the conversion.
thus, the transylvania bank is reducing the rate by 42.5 per cent and the banknotes, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% over the next three years.

the main benefit of the credit lei in chf is that the currency risk is eliminated, with the consumer protected from future franc increases, and credit repayment will be made in the currency in which he receives their salary.
another major advantage of both offers of conversion is that no property review is being made, no additional guarantees and another proof of income are being sought.
in practical terms, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of credit, nor will there be any additional costs as in the case of re-financing.
both banks also offer a reduction at the monthly rate, from how customers paid before conversion, equivalent to the lei.

the problem is that the early years rate is made more of interest and that the customer refunds very little mainly.
the low-interest banknote offer in the first three years seems advantageous to the clients.
however, how this interest will develop after three years is not known.
the margin for customers can be more than 3.25 per cent, so in total, and cost reduction is lower.
a possible risk for all credits in lei at variable interest, is that the robor index will increase significantly over the next few years (more than the libor - chf) index.
for example, robor at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6% in 2009 to over 15%, and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
in addition, other costs may arise, which were not mentioned in the initial offer.
the time has come for interest rate decisions on the us federal reserve
the world is looking at a scheduled meeting in two days' time, wednesday and thursday, when the us federal reserve will make a crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
in a reuters poll involving 80 economists, just over half who last week thought the decision would be made, i now believe the situation will continue for some time and that interest rates would be kept within the current range of 0-0.25%.
this is an historic event because it has been seven years since the federal reserve brought rates to zero.
for the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a process of normalising interest rates, " said angel ubide, chief analyst at the peterson institute for international economics.
the us economy has evolved relatively well, with the recovery bringing usd trillion to the balance sheet and generating a level of low inflation.
however, the federal reserve must not ignore the less rosy global situation.
it has warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
the decision will be announced on tuesday, 20: 00 the tec.
stars who lose their charm
actor (left), along with his son redmond (right), has experienced stressful situations in recent years.
in 2001, he fought leukemia and in 2009 lost her life partner, farrah fawcett, to cancer.
the actor is also said to have faced drug abuse, and in 2008, he was arrested for drug possession.
that certainly has a cost.
manchester united player luke shaw has been sitting on the sidelines for several months because of double fractubling.
luke shaw suffered a double fracture on his right leg in manchester united's match in the champions league that ended with a defeat to psv eindhoven.
after the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and will keep the ara for at least six months, louis van gaal remains optimistic that shaw will be able to play this season again.
the injury came after a reckless intervention by héctor moreno in the 15th minute, after shaw, 20, broke up psv defence.
he received medical care for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
van gaal said, " has double fracture in the leg and is in hospital. "
it will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps the day after tomorrow will then be operated in manchester.
it is appalling - a boy who came to manchester united when he was 18, then he plays fantastic and now this is happening.
oxygen has been given a mask in the west.
.
i am not a doctor, but at the double repdent fracture is six months and will not play in the group stage.
i hope they will be able to play again this season.
it seems that moreno had good luck and got rid of the red card and the concession of a coup.
referee nicola rizzoli has failed to punish mexican.
van gaal suggested that the italian official was wrong.
you can judge yourself when they say it is fault and red card.
it was a very ugly intervention, with two legs.
a message on shaw's twitter account:' thank you all for your messages, no words to express how weakened i feel, the road to recovery is starting, i will return more strongly'.
similar news: manchester united hit by luke shaw's injury in psv defeat
the defender of the england team has an additional reason to recover to play at the european championship in france next june.
phillip cocu, coach of psv, said, " it is a very ugly injury. "
everyone is very sad when a player suffers from such an injury.
our players never aim to injured an opponent.
moreno tore his leg for mexico's national team against the netherlands led by van gaal at the 2014 world championship.
" it is very difficult because he did not intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it is a very serious injury, it is not good, " cocu said.
i saw no stage.
i only managed to see the ball, which was in a different direction, so looked like [moreno] achieved it, but i could not see the intervention on luke.
in his statement for sbs6, moreno said:' i know how it is, i know how difficult it is to get through this.
i feel wrong, i am so sorry.
psv player, andrés guardado, also reached hospital after an intervention from chris smalling.
adam lyth clearly riskengland's omission but is still cool
victory over pakistan in the united arab emirates is a difficult task but but after seeing the team selected for the tournament i do not consider a repeat of its 3-0 defeat in test matches.
i would not get rid of a travel victory either.
alastastair cook's team has less experience than three years ago, but has good players in the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by events in 2012, but will have a positive attitude to young youth.
moeen ali evolves as spinner and adil rashid, although he is unknown to test levels, represents an option for attack.
similar topics: adam lyth has left the england team for the test games and was replaced by alex hales
obviously, as its leading coach in yorkshire, i find it difficult to analyse the decision not to select adam lyth on the team.
he played the seven test matches against two good strikers, under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are on trial after the results.
there were no question marks about joe root, for example, until announcements were made because - and i said before - the players are their own selection.
some fifty years and perhaps lyth would have extended his run, but his destiny is in his hands.
i hope that if it makes more runs for yorkshire it will get other opportunities.
the head coach of the england team, trevor bayliss, praised his attitude even when the performance did not match his capacity and does not surprise me; above all, he is a team man.
it is hard to answer the question how long a batsman is observed in the test matches.
lyth had seven run - like sam robson before him - while nick compton had nine.
only compton had luck at home and travelling.
the only displeasure you could have was that england preferred jonathan trott on the tour of the caribbean - when lyth was in its maximum form - but that missed opportunity is a a thing of the past.
the team includes alex hales, a sman whom i co-correct very well.
he is a cricket player who has the " factor x " and i noticed earlier in yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a pitch trent bridge.
at least the same opportunity should be given as those before him, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the uae team.
the idea was launched for moeteen to open to hes alongside cook, which would lead extra spinner while retaining four quiches, and i have nothing against it.
i do not see why a dumping ter could not hit there and this clumsy player has already shown that he is naive.
perhaps moeteen did not bring success to his district, worcestershire, but it was no 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
my old team colleague, justin langer, played his first 38 test games as first drop before entering the open in 2001.
it immediately deleted three centuries and did not look behind.
zafar sari comes to the team as back-up spinner and, although i had limited contact with him, it has struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
people could judge the early age - with an average of 31 to beat and 35 in the ball - and they might think it is bridges, but there is a lot of thornins and the selection opted for young people.
he will learn a great deal from the tournament.
england has brought some changes to the training team as well.
the appointment of mahela jayawardene, batsman as adviser for test matches could be a master blow.
it is one of the best players and will bring a great deal of experience, as he has played in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
paul collingwood comes for white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and ruthless ambition.
i have always believed that he was born to become involved in the international cricket ket, whether as a player or as coach, and like mahela, has the intuition.
sometimes, the new voices in the west, even if they send messages that have been sent before, can bring fresh air to the team.
colly durham's teammate ben stokes rest for one-day matches, root got a similar break against australia and i have no problem with that.
although not all agree, coaches and selection do not make the programme.
and you must remember, the players' jobs depend on the results they get.
such decisions are never easy.
brexit camp could win if the economy remains in steal until 2017
every passing day, the strategy to renegotiate david cameron in order to keep britain in the eu is getting more and more into the mess, even without the election of jeremy genius yes or no?' corbyn leading the labour party or tuc makes serious criticism of europe on tuesday.
foreigners also have figures like corbyn and nigel farages.
a european diplomat explained in recent days that - submerged in crises similar to that in the eu - not all being caused internally - some member states are being fed by britain's agenda by concessions and changes to the treaties, which most do not want.
in brighton, at its annual meeting, tuc decided that they did not want it either if they erode social protection.
we could even call it dave and george' sel' agenda.
the prime minister and chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, make a picture before a famous local monument with or without the local representative, then return home and say they won allies for reform.
it is me.
my european friend, who wants a uk with an outward perspective under the eu's roof -- " do not leave us with france, " says berlin -- suggests that several short-sighted ministers and officials from some capitals have come to the point where they do not care if they stay staying or leave.
extremely cautiously german chancellor angela merkel has been an ally, but has been at the helm for 10 years and wants to leave her position before her situation totbles, as happened with thatcher (11 years), mitterrand (14), and kohl (16), who stood too long.
in 2017, french president françois hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
his strength, too, is in decline.
poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, spain on the left.
it is hard to believe that they will help the english who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent scotland from exout the britain - something that they do not want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
thus, some ministers may even plan to make remarks that do not help, in the snp style, in the campaign for the uk referendum in 2017 to speed up the brexit process, my friend suggests.
'renegotiation has been fixed' and' britain gained nothing from renegotiation'.
europeans know on their skin how acdefending fleet street can be and how sceptical are oligarchic media barons who view the eu with scepticism because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by tony benn that ratified our entry since 1973 into report 2: 1.
he may remember vaguely of boris johnson, the euro opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was brussels' resent ent.
ed miliband knew enemies.
they included the mixture of tax-paying bags, foreigners with telephone fraud and pseudo non-domi who own most major newspapers.
in fact, tony blair sees them just the same same, but he realised that when you are closed in a cage alongside a nervous gorila, you must give the bananas to distract their attention from the thought of eating at lunch and again to the tea.
in, miliband has been softened than blair in opposition to cameron's idea of a referendum, since blair made a concession on the principle to the abandoned eu constitution, buried by french and dutch voters in 2005, who provided him with an exit card.
the media did not fordon him for that, either.
but jeremy corbyn, who has reached my friendship through the back at westminster on monday - i told him not to stop spending his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting from the ou the murdoch strategy boycotting neil kinnock from the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
it can last, but it must develop a coherent media-cooperation strategy, not with me, but certainly with andrew marr whose position at the bbc left a holiday on sunday.
corbyn's official position towards europe is what i would call lenitly evolving.
he says he would like to remain in a reformed eu.
most who disagree with the conservatives'' anglicism' could agree.
that is what hilary said " un benn, but not a lnite " benn on radio and tv this week, when the researcher in him fought not to admit that the appointment of john mcdondonnell by corbyn as a minister " from the shade " on financial issues was a bad idea.
he reminded me of the 1970s when his father fought on tv to be unfair to labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing his cabinet post.
hilary's fight has been more attractive.
but the fight to remain " in any situation " -- benn's expression -- does not match what mcdonnell said, nor with what jc said to colleagues and lawmakers at a private meeting monday night.
regardless of the image corbyn wants to convey - bear in mind, it made me me - the discipline of the messages remains important in the age age of television, especially in the whorstrom of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and treason.
it is right that cameron should not be given a favour ticket in europe, allowing him to take advantage of the good support of labour workers in the referendum campaign, as mcdonnell has said.
simon jenkins certainly believes.
but the basic sosostry of mcdonnell and corbyin on eu membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is longer just an ezoterical discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom small chism of small differences is a central dogma.
as with its sophistry over nato - tom watson is adamant that the jc will not campaign for giving up - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand.
why should paris or berlin of political capital sliy away - and there, there are suspicious voters - for concessions towards britain, when everything could be worthless?
the us is already rather disappointed about the english's poor military performance in iraq, libya and syria, even with a conservative government that is cutting costs, as i was reminded at the launch of the british influence security forum on monday.
specialists criticise england's public health department's decision
claims by a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some with links in the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
specialists from the editorial team of the british medical journal (bmj) joined the lancet in criticising the evidence used by the public health department of england (england) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
it published the " reference " report last month and described it as a " complex analysis of evidence. "
some researchers, however, have questioned the robustness of data and pointed the finger at links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
an article published last month in lantec medical magazine attacked the " extraordinarily fragile base " which it based its main conclusion.
two other researchers writing in bmj have questioned the claims and basing them " on solid soil or on passing sand. "
martin mckee, a professor of european public health at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, and simon simon capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at liverpool university, have said:' a fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on proof of effectiveness'.
they said they expected the assertions that' current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking' are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
in reality, only one meeting attended by 12 people has led to the drafting of a multi-criteria decision-making model (mcda), summarising their views on the negative effects associated with various products containing nicotina; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a piece of research.
mckee and capewell or said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called euroswiss health, whose executive director said would have previously received funding from british american tobacco to conduct an independent study.
it also validated bat's accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
they added that one of 12 participants in the meeting declared funding received from a producer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding there are reports to have received from the cigarette and tobacco manufacturing company, philip morris international.
no arguments have been provided based on which members of the panel were selected, but among them are some " leaves " known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even say in the financing of the industry.
other meeting participants are not known for tobacco control expertise.
the meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control station.
the research work prepared by the group " convincingly covers up " that there is a lack " solid evidence of the detrimental effect that most products have under most criteria, " mckee and capewell said.
however, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the report.
mckee and capewell said the claims that " so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers, " are premature.
professor kevin fenton, director of the health department at la, says he has responded in the past to claims in bmj.
he said, " electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking "
one in two people who have smoked all of their lives as a result of this vice.
all the evidence suggests that the risk of electronic cigarettes for health is comparatively minor, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
it has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that comes and those that does not come out of evidence, particularly given the high degree of public confusion about the dangers that are in comparison with tobacco.
annually, around 80,000 people lose their lives from a disease associated with smoking, and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking reach gbp 2 billion.
clearly expressing the current evidence - namely that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not free of risk, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

eight gold rules to live at home

violinist david grimal: in bach's era there were no world tournaments.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people working, artists and not commercial representatives.
french violinist david grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a singer but also as the initiator of a less ordinary project, downright' strange', as he himself says, les dissonances - an orchestra of international soloists and talented musicians, ting a symrepertoire without having a conductor, at least.
les dissonances was this year at the enescu festival with two performances: a performance on sunday, in which solist was david grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one monday, when there was celcellist xavier phillips, with the works made up by enescu being nelipsite.
both performances, held on the athens stage, showed the public another kind of performing classical music.
les dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004, at the time, the only classical musical whole in which there is no conductor.
the conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
it is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either in order to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - i speak of toolbox, not of composers.
they are trained as' specialised workers'.
they themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.
on the other side of the scene, for the public, the whole musical complaint focuses on the conductor.
and thus, businesslike, the music industry, makes its marketing.
therefore, we are no longer talking about the music.
so, if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and a public that cannot listen to it, but they has to look at, which is stupid, " believes david grimal.
the violinist describes the change in the way music came from the " musical deception " in his solist career.
i was like a high-level athlete who had to make the same exercise throughout the world with different orchestras, in order to earn a lot of money and bring money to the music industry as well.
10 years ago, when i was about 30 years, i found this very depressing, because we were no longer able to find human creativity and human fraternity in this system.
therefore, we have no longer found any sense in moving further along this road.
that is how i decided to create les dissonances.
this was the case in 2004 and at the time, no one was doing so without a conductor:' the highly conservative, conservative music world, did not want such projects'.
" how do you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians with no more ego? " he asks.
david grimal acknowledges that les dissonaces is " a luxury, " saying none of the musicians part of the orchestra depends on the success of the project.
in 10 years of the existence of the stock, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a barrier in the musical act: " curiously, the more we weigh a more complex repertotoire, the more simpler because all musicians are obliged to attend the opera and not only in role, " argues grimal, adding at sunday's show " we were 74 times on the stage. "
in grimal's view, the enescu festival is a' very courageous one, precisely because he also invited les dissonances:' an extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras in the world who sing and 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras invited this strange group'.
in a temple of orchestrated tradition, such as the enescu festival, there is place and interest in something different, which breaks down barriers.
speaking about enescu's work, the violinist acknowledges that he feels the romanian music of the famous romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced enescu works into his repertoire.
grimal notes that enănescu's music is very instinctive, but that is when we are talking about george enănescu and romanian music, " because there is also a george enescu who has the french music. "
grimal is calling for a change in way classical musical education is conducted, considering that the the musician profession, as it is organised today, has a iz of death " and that " the future of music is the music itself. "
we do not need to make the world's tour 5 times a year if it does not serve anything.
in bach's age, there were no world tournaments.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people who were working, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
for me, organising concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albums, they are all formidable, extraordinary but as long as they are at the service of music.
if not, we are in a system in which creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
to illustrate this phenomenon, david grimal set an example to romanian products before and after joining the eu: " in romania, before entering the eu, you had vegetables and good meat. "
to enter the eu, you had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
production and agriculture are at the service of the supermarkets, as is the case in france.
with music the same happens, it is the same logic.
les dissonances may not be fine, but when cutting them are genuine tomatoes.
in an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, starting with education policy.
" if we thought -- as the koreans, the chinese, the japanese do -- that western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its school learning, we would reintroduce concerts on tv and through this education there would be no need to sell musical by-products, " grimal believes.
there are certainly things in classical musical education that remains very communist, everywhere, is something very militarised.
it is dependent on this discipline whether we compare a musician with a soldier, or whether we form a musician who will sing to an instrument and is, above all, a musician.
this is a completely different education if we want to train a soldier (this education - n.red.) it must somehow somehow if we want to form a musician, it is something different.
in the light of your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? " asks the french artist, who is smiling.
grimal shows that, for artists, the reward for another kind of doing music comes precisely from overcoming this status as' soldier', overcoming what' they think are their limits':' the musicians discover at some point they are not soldiers, and after the concert leaves smilers'.
david grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and artist in the " festival of ideas, " a discussion with the public at the george enescu international festival by the aspen romania institute.

cinema city seeks " small big voices "
cinema city is launching the biggest challenge for children: doubling two characters from the superproduction " 3d snow cracks. "
do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child, whom the films like?
it gives him a chance to see.
in its latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, in september, willing to reach future stars from 8 to 16, cinema city is seeking " small big voices " giving them an extraordinary opportunity to double two figures from a famous animation film.
if emphasis was placed in classical graphics on bringing the actor's voice closer to the specificities of animated personality recently on the creation of stories also take those who are to interpret the voices into account, and they are usually well-known actors.
cinema city romania, however, wants to discover new voices, which is why we are launching an unprecedented campaign.
we want to find the right voice and challenge parents to register their children in our contest.
they will have a special experience, because the characters are sympathetic and replicters are funny.
" children will enjoy fun and will get a real chance to be part of a team of actors, " said ioana ionescu, marketing manager of cinema city romania.

the fedex gains are mixed, lower the fiscal forecast for 2016
fedex declared disappointing results for the last quarter, with the supply giant reducing the estimates of profit profit for the whole year as a result of the low demand for transport services and the increased costs for its land transport division.
the company also said it plans to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the upcoming holiday period.
during the same period last year, fedex announced he would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
the company's shares shrunk by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of wednesday's opening bell.
fedex corp. said he expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next may, with 20 fewer cents, according to an previous estimate.
analysts had projected $10.84, according to a factset poll.
the falling estimate comes despite an average price increase of 4.9 per cent, with entry into force on 4 january, and higher surcharges for land-based transport of large or heavy weight enopes, which will apply since november.
the company said it still expects increased gains from the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of e-commerce.
the president and general fred smith said " the company faces a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially when it comes to global production and trade. "
employment plans during the holidays were announced a day after the ups competitor said it plans to employ 90,000-95,000 workers, about the same number of employment it made last year.
in the quarter that ended on august 31st, fedex earned $692m, 6% more than the previous year.
gains per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share by 12 analysts who responded to the zacks investment research poll.
the profit has risen by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
six analysts participating in the zacks summer poll were $12.23 billion.
the fedex company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to a stagnatof revenues recorded by its express express.
but the explosion in online shopping salsed the results of the fedex ground division.
in the last quarter, the revenues of the ground division increased by 29%, but operational revenues have basically stalled because of the higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
the express express registered an increase in revenues due to higher basic tariffs, while the freight division revenues have decreased due to rising costs.
at pre-market trading about an hour before the opening sound, fedex shares dropped $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
on tuesday, closure fell by 11 per cent year-on-year level and 17 per cent from the record high on june 11th.
at the most expected meeting in recent years, those responsible for drafting policies at the federal reserve will be spending two days this week around an honduran an mahon table with 27 legs to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
above them, at an end of the central bank meeting, a mural painting by the united states will be expected.
the map aims to recall that janet l. yellen, president of the edf and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all.
the central bank has been given a two-fold task from congress: to maximise the employment rate in the us and to maintain price stability.
but since the great economic crisis, edf leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
and this third task could be the x factor in a decision that is difficult to predict, to be announced on tuesday, and which will determine whether the us economy is ready to be disposed by the unprecedented stimulus offered by the short-term interest rate of close to zero in force as of the end of 2008.
even if most data indicate a strong growing economy, the recent turmoil in the global financial markets could scten edf officials already wary of adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even a quarter quarter a percentage point.
" obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will pursue, " said lindsey m. piegza, chief economist at brokeraj stifel nicolaus & co.
" but i think that if they looked for an excuse not to increase interest rates, the growing uncertainty in the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait longer, " she said.
there is no consensus on the decision that the edf will make, with this in itself causing instability in the financial market.
about half of the economists recently questioned by bloomberg predicted an interest rate increase this week.
but the financial markets expect the edf to delay, with a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
that would indicate a drop on the stock exchange if the edf increases the interest rate, unless those drawing up policies were to shion the blow by promising to take some time before the next growth.
on tuesday, dow jones industrial average rose 28.89 points or 1.4 per cent to 16.599.85.
the momentum was triggered by expectations that edf decision makers will maintain the stable interest rate this week, said john lonski, chief economist at moody's capital markets research group.
" it would be surprising if the edf were to increase the interest rate at the moment, " lonski said.
if edf decision makers did so,' they would have to act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets'.
other experts have stated that an increase in the interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the edf will act.
just a month ago, the edf seemed to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the us recovery force.
yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected an interest rate increase this year, despite objections raised by the liberals that more economic progress is needed.
although job creation slowed down in august, labour market growth was strong this year.
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years, and close to the level considered by the edf as full employment.
wage earnings have shown signs of growth.
and although inflation continued to meet the central bank's annual goal, edf decision makers said a key reason has been the temporary effect of dwindling oil prices.
the economy " can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tension in the labour market, " said ian shepherdson, chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics.
but the global financial markets began to enter fibrilets later this month, after china devalued its currency.
dow dow jones industrial average fell by 16% below the record maximum achieved in may, as investors feared that a slowdown in the chinese economy would slow down world growth.
the market suffered somewhat this month, with the dow index now at about 10% below the maximum in may.
for edf decision makers, the turmoil in the market is adding to the complex calculation of the interest rate growth point.
" without what happened on the financial markets and the news about the weakening of the chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be more decisive at the sitting, " said stephen d. oliner, an experienced researcher at the ucla ziman center for real estate and a former edf official.
now he expects to wait at least a month to manage the effects better.
" there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the us economy will be and almost no data later based on events in china, " oliner said.
the well-being of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the edf should basically not be taken into account in decision making.
however, in reality, the edf has become the monetary authority worldwide.
in recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
merely allusion of the then president, ben s. bernanke, in 2013, that the edf could " narrow " its monetary expansion triggered the earthquake in world markets.
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly emanated, edf officials are expected not only to monitor progress made in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to have better interpretation of the world economy.
his decision-making process is " more art than science, " said zachary karabell, head of the global strategy department at the welfare management firm envestnet inc.
jeffrey lacker, the federal reserve bank president in richmond, you. " said this month that " the edf has an overdimensized reaction record to changes in the financial market that appear to be unrelated to economic bases. "
lacker, a voting member of the federal commission on the open market, the decision-making body, which supported the increase in the interest rate, provided the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
a financial crisis that affected asia has led the edf to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, " despite the implications with limited identification for the development of the us, " lacker said.
a year later, edf officials returned to those falls.
the edf should put financial stability first in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said adam s. posen, a former interest-setting commission member at the bank of england.
recent turbulent times are nowhere close to that level, he said.
" we certainly do not want to end up in a situation where we fear an interest rate increase because they have upset the markets, " said posen, president peterson institute for international economics.
the federal reserve act continues to have a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes, i do not think that it should act prematurely.

after police fired rubber bullets at rioters in nepal, 4 people lost their lives
four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern nepal after police fired with rubber bullets at the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed constitution, an official said on wednesday.
the violence occurred tuesday evening in the rupandehi district, about 80km west of the capital kathathmandu.
according to bishnu prasad dhakal, the district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
mr dhakal said that police forces used tear gas before shooting the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
according to him, twenty police officers and five of the civilians were injured.
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets, which are known to kill, but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
the clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in the southern part of nepal, where members of the madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
protests were occurred in the west of nepal, where the tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
at least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes on 10 august,
when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces - a major step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in nepal, a country governed at the central level for hundreds of years.
the procedure for drafting a new constitution was launched in 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in april.
this week in kathathmandu, lawmakers voted on clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted sunday.

burden-cutting surgeon could be useful for light obesity diabetics.
the benefits of cyrillogy of reducing hardship in the case of light obesity, with type 2-type diabet sugar, may remain for at least five years, according to a new study.
it is still premature to say whether light obesity diabetics live longer after weight surgical intervention than those following unhirurgical treatments.
" it takes a long time to centralise mortality data, " said dr robin blackstone, an obesity surgery specialist, who wrote an article on the new study in jama surgery.
weight-losing operations, named and sursurgery of the barrier, are using various methods to dink the stomstry.
they reduce the sense of hunger and limit the ability of the body to absorb food.
over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies were conducted on morbida obesity with a corporate mass index (imc) 35 or higher ones.
the imc, a measure of weight in relation to size, is seen as normal from 18.5-24.9.
the imc value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overlapping and people with more than 30 are seen as obese.
you can calculate your imc by accessing: 1.usa.gov / 1dzqdv.
for the new study, researchers at taiwan's min-sheng general hospital used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of barrier surgery - bypass gastric and gastrectomie in manson - in medical treatment of type 2-type sugar to light obesity.
the average imc to people suffering surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
meanwhile, the imc with people who received nechirurgical treatment against the sugar diabetes remained almost at the same level, 29.
of those suffering surgical intervention, the sugar diabetet sold sold at 36 per cent and partly at 28 per cent.
in the treaty group with medical methods, by comparison, the sugar diabetsold for only 1% and partly for only 2% of the subjects.
furthermore, the control of terrible tension, trigliceridees and lesterol mr " evil " were generally better in the surgical group, " the authors concluded.
the researchers also monitored the sanguin level of hemogloba1c, which reflects the level of euphids over time.
researchers write that the optimum level of a1c globe is below 7%.
after surgical intervention, the average level of aemoia a1c fell from around 9% to about 6%.
but in the treaty group medical methods, it stood at around 8%.
but this improved " glicic control " -- reflected by the improved levels of hemoia a1c -- have not reduced the death rate to five years, according to chief researcher dr. chih-cheng hsu and colleagues.
the research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
in the fifth year compared to the gastrectomie in manson, the surgical intervention group lost more weight weight (18.7% from 14.2 kg), higher imc value falls (7.4% to 5.1% (3.1% from 2.1%).
although the new study does not indicate any benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence of a study by heavy-weights in sweden that surgical intervention extends life, says blackstone, of arizona university, the faculty of medicine - phoenix.
in the swedish study, obese people who suffered surgical intervention of the barrier presented an estimated 29% lower probability to die after 15 years compared to a group that has tried more conventional methods.
although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival to patients who suffered surgical intervention, blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for people with the imc below 35 interested in the procedure.
" this is the point where this work is critical, because it says that this surgical intervention is safe in the lower imc group, " without increasing risk of death or renal disease, she says.
blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start - taking the weight seriously then the patient's imc reaches 27-30.
" i think we wait too long to urge people to take this seriously, " she said.
i believe that once they acquired these genetic changes that have short circuit their bodies by posing them to obesity and diabet, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
" it is impossible for everyone to come to europe " - the dalai lama - rt news
europe could not receive all refugees, the dalai lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the middle east.
the tibetan buddhist leader has been calling for an end to violence in the mother countries of refugees.
the dalai lama spoke about the issue of the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of oxford ford compassion of the dalai lama centre, dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to the uk.
he said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even every continent.
he also stressed that, although admirable, the response of western european countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
" it is impossible to come to europe, " he said in his speech.
although the dalai lama praised germany and austria's efforts to tackle the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
" it is wonderful care for a few thousand refugees, but we also have to think about long-term solutions in order to bring peace and genuine development, especially through education, to muslim countries, " he stressed.
after all, we need to think about ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
we must reduce the use of force.
the force has never solved these problems, " he added.
on the issue of violence, the dalai lama also commented on george bush's actions following the 11 september terrorist attacks, saying the us violent response generated a chain of uncontrolable events.
after the events of 11 september, i expressed our condolences in a letter to president bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
i know his motives were strong, but he used force and generated unexpected consequences, " the dalai lama said.
a four fold increase in the number of children pushing for hands-related detergent gent over the past 4 years
according to the international anti-poisoning centre in georgia, the us anti-poisoning centres have reported an increase of around 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have freezing alcohol-related detergent hands.
according to dr gaylord lopez, director of georgia's anti-otravire centre, cases of hands detergents in children under 12 reported at anti-poispoisoning centres rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
" children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them reach the emergency chamber, " lopez told cnn.
lopez said some children were intentionally drink detergent, while others do so to impress their friends to respond to challenges on social media.
films can be watched on youtube showing the presence of teenagers as they were deterdetergent in order to create cheap beverages.
teenagers are said to have mixed up alcohol-water detergents to get a stronger drink.
smaller children can be drawn to the attractive smell of detergents.
" a child does not think that he is hurting them, " lopez says.
many of the most attractive types (of detergent hands) are those smoked.
hands of detergents with strawberries, strugure, the steal are the most attractive to children.
the hands-hands detergents contains 45-95 per cent of alcohol.

why i see execution in oklahoma
later today, with the exception of a belated legal intervention, i will look at how a man to death is sentenced.
if it happens, and i hope, i will sit in a room for observers from the oklahoma state execution room and will see how richard glossip is executed by managing the lethal injection.
he asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
the invitation first came in january, through his best friend, and, although i was shocked, i accepted.
as the day approaches, it terrifies the idea.
so why?
i agreed because i thought it was a good way of telling the whole story of capital punishment.
it would be unique.
it is true, journalists can witness executions in america and, because applications usually exceed the number of available places, a macabra lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
those elected are going to look at execution impartially.
i cannot.
i would stand by richard glossip's closest friends, in addition, i have developed my own contact with him throughout the months of telephone conversations and a two-half-hour visit.
i like.
we often laugh when we talk.
prison authorities say they also cannot be a witness and journalist, so i will be allowed to have a carok and a pix at me to note what i see.
i will have to try to remember all the details.
a journalist from oklahoma accused twitter of compromising my impartiality.
that is the lesson.
it tells the story of the way he wants, gets access.
i complained.
he acknowledged that " he could have formula better, " but still says i am wrong.
richard glossip disagreed with some of the things i have said and have written.
it does not tell me what to write, and i would not do so if it asked me either.
i told him that he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
but he wants an international report to write on the subject.
it believes that, if it dies, advertising will help the movement against the death penalty.
huffington post reporter kim bellware will be with me.
if you want to find out more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files we have made.
i will not come back here to all the details.
i cannot say with certainty that richard glossip is innocent.
his actions after barry van treese were guilty of complicity.
but i think he may not be guilty of murder.
i certainly believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
i think execution is wrong.
and i will look at him dying from that perspective.
i cannot claim to be totally objective.
for this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
from me, you will know how it is to watch a man he likes by dying needlessly.
peter moody claims stewarzii tried to spy him, threatens to pull out of races
peter moody said stewarracing his victory sought to infiltra spy into his raids last year and threatened to withdraw from races.
he launched an attack against stewards and the integrity department of racing victoria, saying they run a personal campaign against him, a drop that filled the glass being the removal of lady tatai from the race because of treatment administered on race day.
moody told fair fax media that it has always tried to do what is best for flights and is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome of lidari' balber test, for which it has no explanation.
for 18 months he swallowed his words about spy statements and did not look like a' volcano that does not reach grapes'.
" i was not going to say anything about that and i have been quiet a long time, but sometimes you reach a level of frustration so high that everything is burst at once, " moody said.
it is well-known that it has continued.
sometimes you react and you have to deal with the consequences, and i will have to live with what i have said.
i will go home last night and sleep in peace.
i want to go with my heads high and i want the owners with whom i work to see that i strive to give them the best.
once they start to believe that this is not the case, they have to give up the trainprofession.
then i will have to consider what i will do with my certification.
earlier, moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com saying the integrity department had tried to spy on its walls.
" eighteen months ago, terry bailey, dayle brown and dr brian stewart were sitting in a room together with a man -- whose name i will say if i am asked -- and have offered to commit him to my maps to provide information about the work there, " moody told racing.com.
obviously, he considers me to be a trisor.
if that is the case, then they should all step down because they were incompetent in an attempt to catch me.
robert roulston, former rvl president, david moodie, current president of rvl and bernard saundry, current executive director of rvl, knew at the time, and i know today.
should i think that this is something of a personal nature?
is it necessary for the rvl to start having the backbone and hold people from outside traitors to account for what is happening in industry?
do i have a bad influence on the industry?
so bad is my influence on industry?
perhaps that is how others see it.
perhaps i have to take my license and take me aside, and i have no doubts that the statements i am now making could make them think about this.
but i have reached the point where i no longer care anymore and that saddens me.
i am sad.
i will put ep pressure and make a decision.
my family is behind me and can leave.
the frustration of the trainer has increased with the longstanding investigation into whale testing involving the rulers, and the elimination led him to affirm that he could " place his license on the table. "
moody, whose name is most associated with training the undefeated champion black caviar, labelled the treatment rule on race day as " ridiculous " after it applied to a cataplasma with namol or argila, breaking the rules.
they violate races rules.
i have to take full responsibility for this, " he says.
one of my employees wrongly put namol on the leg.
it could have happened last night.
it could have happened yesterday, which was also the case.
it happened on the day of the race.
moody may be disqualified for three months for its treatment on the race day, for which stewarguard opened an investigation.
joke.
people who make these rules do not know anything about horses.
" we all understand that there is a need for rules, but it went too far, " moody said.
driver who hit, fled cobram arrested
police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist in cobram at the weekend and followed by fleeing from the site of the accident.
the bike was transported by helicopter to the royal melbourne hospital, seriously injured after being hit by a car on the murray valley highway saturday morning.
police representatives say the car driver did not stop to help the injured bike.
on monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to the shepparton police.
he will reportedly be accused of running from the site of the accident, failing to provide the first help and other traffic crimes.
the bike, a 40-year-old man from cobram, remains internalised in stable condition.
coach melbourne storm, craig bellamy, responds to opponents in wrestling charges.
coach melbourne storm, craig bellamy, named criticism of the placking tactics used by his team as " distorted topics " raised by the two top favourites in nrl.
sydney coach roosters trent robinson said the referees allowed storm players to " take them in tranta " the team won nervos storm storm in the qualification final friday in sydney.
brisbane broncos coach, wayne bennett, made a slight reference to storm after his team's victory in the north queensland cowboys qualification match late saturday, when he called it a " demonstration " of the rugby league and said the queensland two teams were little much about wrestling.
bellamy jumped in defence of the placence tactics addressed by his team, and said the players simply focused on " contact " when they liked.
bellamy said he gained trust after two leading coaches criticised his team, meaning they were worried that storm ii would win.
" and things don't stop here too -- i didn't hear trent robinson to complain about the wrestling when they beat us 24-2, " bellamy said on wednesday.
i can guarantee that we have changed nothing every year in our defensive systems or techniques, just as in the last six weeks, we have really emphasis on contact in plac, and so we have changed the situation.
trent has been in office for three years, and obviously has a wonderful team, so not used to lose and was a shock to him.
we know how it always happens during this period of year.
bellamy contradicted bennett's idea of " animating football, " reminding his proreminiscent of bennett's mentor george-ilwarra dragons won the championship in 2010, staring " boring " football.
wayne discusses exciting football.
he argued his opinion comparing his saturday evening game with our game on friday evening and spoke about how exciting the game was, " bellamy said.
i remember that in 2010, st george received a lot of criticism for being a boring team and wayne said he was not interested in him under the dark either.
but now it has a team that can play what we would consider exciting football, especially because of quick young midfielders.
this kind of game you want to play when you have such players.
he made that argument in 2010, he now wants everyone to adopt his style of play -- not any team has two midfielders like anthony milford and ben hunt hunt so that they can do so.
it gives me more confidence because they are saying this because they are somewhat concerned about the match with us.
six weeks ago they probably did not think of us when thinking of important matches.
bellamy also pointed out that the match between storm and roosters was a sharder match of the score compared to the match between broncos and cowboys.
the match of the broncos was probably a good match, we have not yet seen it, what has the score been? 16-12?
our match ended 20-18, were there two more attempts in our game, does that mean palilling game?
or does the pitch mean making breaks and not walk?
i have plans.
if i talk about us, it means that at some point, we could meet them.
storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home either with north queensland cowboys, or with cronulla sharks, in the pre-trial final of next saturday, in aami park, with tickets tickets going up for sale from the beginning of next morning.
stevan hogg used the phone of' girls to lure the paedophiles to send images.
a paedophile had been using the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
stevan hogg took the girl's phone when her sleep then showed himself in an online-messaging service where another user sent him a number of indecent images of children as a topic.
the girl later found up and observed the disappearance of the phone, which he found in the hands of hogg while he was sleeping.
he looked over the phone and found the disturbing messages and then immediately alerted her own mother.
after their arrival, police saw the five pictures then analysed computers found at the address and found " worrying " searches on the internet using terms to find indecent images of child subjects.
hogg claimed he did so to " attract paedophiles " to the internet before " pretending to be a police officer to frighten them. "
prosecutor eilidh robertson told the court in the danube: " said he is a dependence -- that he is dependent to frighten people.
he admitted he made computer searches but said he did so because he wanted to give himself a policeman to scare for paedophiles.
he was asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and that he asked the person to send them any other pictures.
he said he did so in order to lure it.
he said he no longer thinks clearly when she drinks and wants to see images of rapes and murders.
mr robertson added:' when the girl found telephone messages, he shouted his mother and shosing and complained.
fegirl saw indecent pictures on the phone and the defendant was faced.
the little girl was interviewed and told that the defendant used the computer and the playstation to speak to girls who seemed much younger than him.
last year, on 14 june, 23 year-old hogg, living in ward road, dundee, pleaded guilty to charges that he had made or made indecent pictures of child subjects, and violated the conditions of conditional release on 25 january this year and failed to appear at his appearance on 24 march this year.
the defence lawyer, gregor sim, has requested that hogg be not registered in the sex offenders register because it can be said that this crime " did not involve a significant sexual aspect. "
judge alistair carmichael postponed the sentence until october, for reasons of social reports.
hogg was released on bail on the file, but remained in custody prior to the discharges for other caseload.
it was passed to the register of sex offenders before the sentence was given.

it warns the mps concerned that immunity applies only to parliament, and once they leave parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer of value.
the head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by morgan tsvangirai, was " concerned " about the threats made to politicians.

friendsfest: the comedy series that taught us some important lessons about men's friendship
the absence of similar figures in the series is evident, given the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching the summit of the last 15 years.
in 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the uk, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
seeking to address the problem, the campaign against unfortunate life (campaign against living miserably (calm) named 2015 2015 as the man's year, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need.
friendship is at the heart of the fight for the success of this challenge.
a recent recent conducted of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by sufficiently many friends " with a healthy state of mood, " his chances for recovery doubles.
similarly, for people who are not suppressed, a circle of mental healthy friends is reducing by half the likelihood of mental disorders appearing.
of course, in order for friendship to have effect, it must, first of all, be within reach.
in this age of the communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes priority before contact with great significance.
our digital lives have doubled the need to create the apparent appearance of a powerful figure, open to fun and success, even though in reality, it is isolation that wins.
this meagish success is dominated by what the psychologists call extrinsect values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which even more deeply affect our mental health.
the billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that the money really does not buy happiness.
the beauty of friends friends was that it focused attention to this idea.
characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
the mour of joey and chandler's frequent hugging when they look at football in the comcoment seats and ross's passion for rachel came from the fact that men can associate themselves with this situation, even though they often hide to explode their feelings.
as a social worker explained to me:'... my role in listening to the people with a suicide and depressed trend has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference'.
often, the people who turn to us do not feel able to speak with friends.
his old adage is doing alone is strong, as is the sense of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
friends is one of the series that come to mind when i am trying to offer more long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
the show highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
however much objective, outward intervention helps, by telephone, people arrive in times of despair, long-term support comes from the family and close friends.
thus, if you attend this weekend at friendsfeast organised by the central comedy edy, with the complete redof filter platos in order to celebrate the event why do not invite your friends to a coffee in central perk.
or, even better, if you see someone alone in starbucks, smile and salute.
it is never known what difference your friendship could make.
friends are aired on the central comedy from the beginning to finish -- all 236 episodes -- in ho# friendsfest.
di maria marks, helps malmo aside
angel di maria celebrates blaise matuidi and edinson cavani after playing against malmo.
angel di maria marked her debut match in the champions league on tuesday and helped the bsp come up before the swedish team malmo.
we are still presenting you chronic to the match and the reaction to the game.
angel di maria and edcavani have done their job, paris saint-germain from the series of matches in the champions league groups, with a quiet 2-0 victory against malmo in a match at the des princes park on tuesday.
di maria marked her debut match in the bsp champions league kicked off in less than four minutes, bringing france's champions while having missed a number of opportunities before securing its advantage with a cavkyear goal in the 61st minute.
reaching group a with real madrid and sahtior donetk, paris needed a strong start against the swedish championships, because the french team's goal is not only optimqualifying but also an improvement in the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
but, although they made the points, laurent blanc students were far from a perfect picture, with zlatan ibrahimovic who wasted a goal opportunity before replaced by the team in his hometown and the club at which his bright career began in 1999.
" it is not easy to win home or travel to the champions league, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable difference from the next classes, even though there are still issues we need to improve during the season, " blanc says.
this augurs well.
we wanted to win and we did so, although i am sorry that we did not manage to give one or two goals.
ibrahimovic returned after injury to one of three changes to the paris team, with a 2-2 reachieved home by bordeaux in league 1 at the weekend, but di maria took up the spotlight in the fourth minute.
last month when he was transferred from manchester united, argentine offensive midfielder was appointed the man who leads the bsp to the next level in europe and he demonstrated this when he dashed to the marco verratti pass behind the defence of malmo before he put put incredible fish over johan wiland, to the long corner of the net.
but if one expected the bsp to win victory through their finfingers, they were disappointed.
malmo, who beat celceltic in play-off to reach this stage and entered into the field with nine national team holders, with a defence from five people and two defensive midfielders, was a strong adversary.
but their attack was not impressive, with the exception of nikola djurdjic who passed through kevin trapp's post in the 34th minute.
instead, the bsp players slowed the pace several times, giving some unnecessary passes and not completing the intervention, even ibrahimovic who missed as many as five attempts in the first half alone and then replaced by cavyears even after the game had resumed.
ibrahimovic, however, has proved much more skilin supporting her colleagues, and his care is the one di maria sent to a diverted by jumping across the gate in the 52nd minute.
the second goal was eventually scored after an hour was slipping out of the match, thanks to cavani, uruguayan who scored the sixth goal in the season after ibrahimovic passed from the centt of maxwell.
that goal removed malmo's hope that they would rebalance the score and only a superstop by wiling a distance to reject david luiz kept the final score before the newly elected ezequiel lavezzi was cancelled in an extensions.
the norwegian team coach in malmo, age hareid, later said that the bsp had a fish class and " the last game we played in the champions league was in december last year. "
since then, we have only played in the swedish league, which is not equal.
qualifications are insufficient.
the floor for the bsp.
they were excellent.

the glencore company, based on the london stock exchange, said it sold gbp 1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off the debt.

it pulled 1.3 billion shares out of the company, accounting for 9.99% of the group.

xi pushes for broader expansion of the world economy
on tuesday, president xi jinping told a group tasked with reforming that the economy needs to open up more widely to the outside world in order to fuel growth.
" china must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and to improving its opening policies, " xi said, at the 16th meeting of the central steering group for the continuation of overall reforms (central leading group for deepening overall reform).
promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring a new impetus and vitality and room for economic growth, xi said.
the steering group adopted a number of guides, including a negative list of regulating market access, relaxing border control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital, re-organising the residents' registration system.
according to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up which will identify sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not permitted.
the system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
according to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a business environment based on legislation and providing a greater opening-up to the market.
the state authorities will also weaken controls over the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their affairs.
also, according to the statement, china will allow border regions to explore the new models for cross-border economic cooperation, and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
in a bid to open up state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
" the authorities of the state will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies set up foreign investment and provide them with better services, " the statement said.
in addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply permanent residence permits or the so-called' green cards', optimising requirements and shortening the process of submitting applications.
the meeting also discussed guaranteeing the right of practice of lawyers and educating the judges and prosecutors.
the meeting was attended by prime minister li keqiang and the leaders liu yunshan and zhang gaoli, according to a statement after the meeting.

a man's rare illness
the us, nick hess was suspected by his family as an alcolic lic, the wife even shooting him when he was upite, could hardly stand on his feet and his words were hard to understand.
although the 35-year-old man said saying he had not consumed alcohol, it was visible that he was in ebriety.
when he first accused me of being the drunk, without drank, i thought it was crazy.
" but friends and the family thought' maybe drink alone, she is one alcoholic in secret', " he counts, in mirror.
when he saw the footage of his wife with him, the man in columbus, ohio, simply did not recognise himself:' i am looking in my eyes and i was not there'.
'was appalling, i remember nothing'.
moreover, his wife, who, although he doubted for a while of him, he eventually went with him to countless doctors as well, remembers that nick's breath was a smell of alcohol.
the moment to give nick the thought was when, after a minor accident, when it was hit by another car, it was found to have alcohol content three times above legal limlimite, though one evening before it consumed only one beer.
after years and unnumerned investigations, it was discovered that nick was suffering from a very rare disease, " self-brewery syndrome. "

the man has " attacked " his car with a golf crob, causing sufficient damage for the car to get out of use, bt says.
the whole scene was filmed and the customer reached the internet to those who watched it.

the government approved on wednesday " national immigration strategy for the period 2015-2018 " and the " action plan under way, " documents seen as " another stage romania takes as part of efforts to modernise the immigration management process within national territory, " according to a press release.
the cited source shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and courses of action that reflect the policies established at european level, adapted to national realities.
given the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of romania, measures are envisaged for the unified and coherent management of situations caused by the possible appearance of an influx of illegal immigrants into romania, caused by situations of a political, social, economic or military nature.
" the romanian authorities will help create a system of flexible admission but, at the same time, they will pay particular attention to citizens from states that have potential migration, or which may harm national security, " the source adds.
the strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in syria, re-activating the conflict in iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the border areas of romania (ukraine, transnistria), the perpetuation and intense increase of the israeli-palestinian armed conflict.
on the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic immigration objectives, such as promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls of the legality of residing third-country nationals within romania and proper application of distant measures and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
the national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of general strategic objectives.
these include: facilitating access to romania for third-party nationals who meet employment needs, favouring access for third-country citizens to higher education institutions in romania for the areas and professions identified as shortective.
with regard to the 2015 action plan, the government welcomes that this is' a means of establishing concrete activities to lead to the creation of a flexible system for putting an end to the growing migration phenomenon'.

romania ranks third in the eu

the only eu states where the average labour cost fell in the second quarter this year were greece (minus 2.9%), cyprus (minus 1.2%) and italy (minus 0.4%).
the rise in labour costs in romania between april and june 2015 is mainly due to the sharp increase in labour costs in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.

the tvr leadership's activity report, which was rejected in committees: stelian tanase risks sacking off.
parliament's culture committees on wednesday rejected an activity report by the board of directors of the romanian tv company for 2014.
to reject the report voted for 17 lawmakers, one against the rejection (senator varujan vosganian) and one abstained.
the text of the report will be submitted to the permanent offices brought together.
they will probably decide next week.
at the next joint plenary, it will be debated.
" i think that in light of this situation will be done relatively quickly, " said chairman of the senate culture committee, georgica severin.
he added that " it was common sense " for the tvr's leadership to be present at this session, as no single representative of the tvr leadership was present at the culture committee meeting.
it was in common sense to have the tvr leadership present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something of this kind.
the invitation came to members as as early last night, with an approximate hour that we did not know us either, but today, after the office meeting, i personally sent a fax to tvr leadership inviting it.
i believe that when you are called, you are budgetary employees, paid from public taxes and are called to a joint committee meeting even though you do not like alive.
" because it is your service obligation, you are in an institution subordinate to parliament, " severin said after a committee meeting brought together by parliament's culture.
he added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the budget committees.
the debts also saw us as they continued, came with the idea that it was be up this year, but they were not paid from the historical ones.
" i remind you that it is not my fault or anyone else in these committees that that pleasure was lost with the banks and taxation, there are clear management problems, " severin added.
after the activity report is rejected by the joint plenary, elections for a new board of directors will follow, he added, and it would elect the institution's director-general.
i do not know who will be proposed for this.
wonders are not going to be done.
political decisions are important in order for this institution to function.
i am not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will queue here and beat ck.
i hope that those who decide, parliament's plenary, through their vote, will make a very sensible choice of the people who will lead the tvr.
they must be people who know what is going on there, have experience and have a great deal of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
i do not know who will be, if you ask me what qualities they must have - common sense in the attitude towards employees because it is a malagof of petitions coming from employees, complaints, redundancy.
" when you receive such complaints 50, 60, 70, something is rotten, about the financial situation that is a disaster, " concluded the chairman of the senate's culture committee.
although he did not appear in parliament, tvr president-general, stelian tanase, wrote to the president of the chamber of deputies, valeriu zgonea, calling for parliament to consider a series of measures that could save and guarantee the economic and political independence of public television, including indexation of tv tax.
in the letter, stelian tanase asked, in addition to indexing the tv tax, amending and supplementing hg 978 / 2003 on the tax on public television service, in order to update provisions at technological change to day, well also to regulate the procedure control control in the payment of the tv tax and the finding of offences and the application of penalties and penalties.
he also wants a provision to be issued providing for an extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become srtv warrants for the collection of tv tax, by involving anre in regulating this activity.
in his opinion, it is necessary to set a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission from receipts.
stelian tanase called for reducing the vat rate for activities specific to public television station and the contribution to the cnc from 15% to 3%, but also changes to law 41 / 1994, with the possibility of receiving budget / funding allocations for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sports events -- the world football championship, the golden g, eurovision.
he claims that srtv will face default in the coming months, given that labour legislation obliges the employer to the enforcement of court judgments, even if they are not final and wage rights are priority over any other obligation.
the tvr administration has constantly made efforts to slash spending on personnel and tv production.
" thus, travel and other cost-generating activities have been reduced, a number of trade contracts have been renegotiated and at the end of july, tvr news has been closed, " the letter of president tvr said.
they thought that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied by their efforts alone.
" without the support of state institutions -- the government, parliament, the presidency -- romanian television will be, sooner or later, unable to carry out its public mission again, " the letter noted.
the chamber of deputies decided to send the letter to the committee of culture.

ilie sarbu voted vice-president at court of auditors
parliament's plenary voted wednesday to appoint psd senator ilie sarbu, prime minister victor ponta as vice-president of the audit authority at the court of auditors.
290 votes " for " and 108 " were registered, according to mediafax.

incidentally, the liberals have criticised the appointment of sârbu and have announced that they will challenge it at the ccr, when he has a dossier with the dna but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
ilie sarbu has 30 days, under law, to resign from the senate because the new position at the court of auditors does not allow him to do politics.
the psd senator will serve as vice president of the audit authority at the court of auditors, left free after ioan anton was revoked, following a decision by the september 2014 constitutional court that found he was named unconstitutional.

ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander, irrational claims
hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto harshly on wednesday morning condemned romanian prime minister victor ponta's claims that political decision makers in hungary " nothing better than those in syria, libya or other countries that refugees are fleeing. "
" yesterday, victor ponta lost self-control and, with his irrational statements, he offends the whole of hungary, " the hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
civilised european politicians do not say such uncontrolled slander.
" his remarks have only one explanation: they completely lost support in domestic politics in romania, " added the head of hungarian diplomacy, according to mti.
in a facebook posting late tuesday evening, prime minister victor ponta said he wants to draw attention and sanction the behaviour of senior hungarian government officials, who, he said " are a disgrace to the culture and values of the european union. "
i do not want to respond to the challenges posed by hungarian government representatives.
" they are a disgrace to the culture and values of the eu; also in anti-semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis! " ponta said on facebook.
the romanian prime minister added that he favours sensible and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, noting that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
barbbarbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will show that in hungary, at the heart of europe, political decision makers nothing better than those in syria, libya or other countries the refugees are fleeing!
" i believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of european values -- what we see in the last few days in hungary is in complete contradiction with precisely these goals and values! " the head of the romanian executive stressed.
earlier on tuesday, hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto described as " mere lies " as romanian prime minister victor ponta's remarks about hungary's handling of the refugee crisis, noting that those claims were inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to the mti.
the head of hungarian diplomacy also noted on tuesday that the romanian prime minister's " extremist and misleading remarks " concern the domestic political crisis in romania and made it clear that budapest expects apologising from the romanian side.
szijjarto referred to prime minister victor ponta's statement monday.
what i have said and always say is that i am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing borders, like all those who come are terrorists, are nonsense of the middle ages ages and i totally oppose this approach.
if we can get more, we will get, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not as they treat our hungarian neighbours with knock and seriousness.
" that is what i do not agree, " the head of the romanian executive, said at a press conference in targu-jiu.
also on tuesday, peter szijjarto announced that the government in budapest decided to start preparations on the ground for expansion to the border with romania of the fence that it is building on the border with serbia, in order to deal with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
later, prime minister victor ponta said hungary's decision to raise a border fence resolves nothing of the refugee problem, and " takes hungary out of europe. "
what link exists between osama bin laden and the collapse of mecca cranes
saudi authorities have announced that the saudi saudi giant binladin group, belonging to osama bin laden's family, is " partly responsible " for the crane of a crcrcrane on the large mosque in mecca on friday, which has result as a result of 107 people died.
according to an investigative commission, the company did not " comply with safety rules, " the saudi news agency (spa), the bbc reported.
company executives were banned from leaving the country until the investigation into the case is complete.
it will also be excluded from new public contracts.
the construction firm is owned by the family of former al-qaeda terrorist network leader osama bin laden.
the company was founded by osama bin laden's father 80 years ago and headed by the brother of the former terrorist leader, bakr.
binladen group has been working on expanding large mosques for 4 years now to be able to house more pilgrims.
the accident occurred during a storm on friday evening, when a crashh, probably unbalanced by the powerful shelsts of wind, collapsed on the eastern part of the roof of the large mosque in mecca.
the accident left 107 people dead and nearly 400 people injured.
how their haghaggmouth shut down their contestings
viewed by many as romania's greatest football player in history, gica haghagi was labelled, after pulstepping down, as a poor coach who cannot be able to achieve performances in the new post.
after unfortunate experiences with the national team, his star or galatasaray, haghagi took over a year ago over the coaching role in the constant future, the team he patrons.
after fixed a year after taking the team, the king demonstrated that he is capable of turning a team struggling to save from downgrading to a top.
thus, a year later, the future has registered, with hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 mishles and 11 defeats.
the balance is one of a top team that is knocking on european cups.
things took an even better turn for the future this season, as the team reached second place in league 1, 19 points, one less than the leader astra giurgiu.
the future also has the best league 1 attack with 20 goals (on par with astra), more than double than flag.
on the other hand, even though he has brought several experienced players to the team, haghagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and names have emerged recently like ianis hagi, or hodorogea in the start team.
club policy has made the future a wanted team for foreign teams, so hagi sold 1.5m euros -- ianis hagi (fiorentina - 1m euros) and alexandru mitrita (bari - 500 thousand euros).
along with steaua, the future is the only profitable league 1 team, according to data from the trade register.
in the refugee crisis, romania has so far played as a small country.
it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the eu's seventh largest country.
the large countries are coming up with solutions for the entire eu, says cristian ghinea, member of the steering college of the romanian centre for european policies.
in an interview with ziare.com, cristian ghinea said that europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and purely police means will not be operating in this crisis: " maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come from. "
but they are masses that started, and we cannot go back history.
migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as well as possible and adapt them to us.
in cristian ghinea's view, we are at an extremely emotional time, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
once it passes, europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the schengen area must be changed:' schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to the situation of now'.
where are we in refugee crisis after this jha council, which, in fact, has not solved anything?
it is clear that the ec president in agreement with donald tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
all the predictions were saying they would have had the necessary votes.
before the treaty of lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in the jha, and any state could block any decision.
that is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
after lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which it takes initiative, and the council also approves it with the vote of 55% of states, i.e. 16, which will account for 65% of the eu's population.
the calculations said that the votes were there.
but they did not want to go any further.
because this is a sensitive issue, rejection reactions have appeared in germany itself against chancellor merkel's opening policy and did not want it to appear in many countries as a response like' the eu sends us migrants per head'.
they have therefore put on hold, but the problem remains because this wave is obviously creating a huge problem for the governance of schengen and we will probably see great changes there in the coming period.
so mandatory quotas have not really been abolished, but has the subject been allowed to continue?
yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement by frontex in managing external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are on the external border of schengen to the responsibility of community agencies.
greece's border with turkey is also the de facto border with turkey de facto, and this wave of migrants has bowed the limits of the old schengen system.
perhaps the dublin principle will be waived, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state that they enter for the first time, because it is not sustainable.
if greece acts, you cannot say forever that it is greece's business.
the problem.
precisely because the problem is common, is a solution possible without a precise, perhaps even binding, mechanism for sharing the receipt effort?
no one knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work, if it comes to them.
because it remains a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to romania or portugal, but to sweden or germany?
i do not believe that european states will like to take the migrants high: you are going to country x or to the country of y.
it will probably lead to some single filtering centres, in greece or in turkey, where asylum applications can be processed.
work is being done on solutions such as this.
but the problem does not have a simple resolution.
there are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, are countries without any experience like romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic.
the fact is that there are millions of people who are in turkey, lebanon, jordan, who are in poor camps and who have just just started to europe.
an estimate says that only 10% managed to leave, winter is hard to cross the mediterranean, but we expect an even larger wave next year.
what are we doing with them?
my nonsense is that we will get used to this problem, we will no longer regard it so catastrophic in media terms.
you were talking about countries with less or greater experience.
does it seem to you that there is any place where it has really managed to integrate large groups derived from an extra-european culture?
i look at magrebians in france, at turks in germany, they are also being enclaves.
i would not make radical statements.
of course their integration is more difficult than other migration waves, but this does not mean that they do not integrate at all.
it remains an unintegrated part creating major social problems in france, germany, britain.
but purely police means are not going to work.
create fortress europe is illusory.
it must be blamed on the integration mechanisms in european societies.
there were some mistakes here.
we must be more demanding.
let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take on values, to stop staying on a foot in europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family, including through marriages of convenience.
however, the imminent issue of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
if others have failed in long-term integration does not mean that we have to look at them how they are drowning in the mediterranean.
perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come with.
and if there is an intervention in syria, which i do not believe, it does not mean that it will rebuild the country overnight and take them back.
until solutions emerge, we see a fortress within europe.
borders have been closed, walls, border controls are introduced to the schengen area.
is the european project in jeopardy?
the european project as such is not, the schengen area as built, yes.
it was built quite minimal and arranging the rules so the pressure was too high on the countries where they put these migrants for the first time.
that is, we are moving freely and there, but everyone is with his problems.
this cannot be the case of such a wave, because some countries do not cope.
when there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show they are doing something, but in the long term nothing little changes.
after the attacks in france do not have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the eu than we had last year.
it is a wave of public emotion that is installed in both ways.
and it is so unstable from one week to the next that you cannot make decisions based on it.
we have a lot of talking, many rebellion statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virili.
and then, you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in turkey, and public opinion is excited.
after public public emotion, we will return to the reasons why we created this area, this freedom of movement, which is not only for people but also for goods.
this is the real single market in europe.
and i do not think that europeans will give up on this principle of libertatliberty of movement.
that there will be some other rules.
schengen is now like an animal created in another era and which was not adapted to the current situation.
how has romania played in this crisis so far?
as a small country, which believes that by digging in its eyes and ears its ears, the theme is disappearing disappearing.
faced with the reality of reality of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it is not your small country problem.
that is what we have done, it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
you are not, you are not playing at a big country level.
the large countries come up with solutions for the whole of the eu, good or bad, we are not talking about their quality now.
just as poland has done.
on the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the romanians for schengen will fall very much.
president iohannis says it is a good thing that we have not entered yet.
we therefore move from despair of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
there is of course a risk if romania and bulgaria enter schengen that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
this does not mean that it is a reason to stop entering schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
romania will be part of schengen, and schengen will exist, but transformed into the sense in which external borders will become joint responsibility, there will be single rules for accepting migrants, single deportation rules for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for the countries considered to be safe.
the ukrainian president was saying that after russia moved its attention to syria to ukraine, no one died.
is there a connection between the two seals, a game by russia?
russia behave frustrating power.
she thinks being great power means getting the americans and europeans.
from that point of view, yes, there is a linkage.
without the putin regime's military and financial effort, the assad regime would likely have collapsed.
and it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the islamic state.
about two years has been a struggle between the assad regime and the moderate secular and muslim militias, supported by the gulf and the western countries.
then the islamic state rose up and now we no longer know whether we want the assad regime to fall.
russia was able to complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
it creates an outbreak of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
but you are only great power if you also have solutions.
off-side game is just a strategy for time.
it is unlikely that offers will be made, to press the barrels in order to resolve the situation.
the offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can resolve one way or another the issues he has also created.
but i do not agree with the theories that say that these people are eating by an invisible hand.
let us not see slightly stronger than it is.
what buton is to appear soon
millions of facebook users have become used to the " like " button, and now representatives of the social networking network prepare another other of " dislike. "
on tuesday, mark zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on his account that this button would be available soon, reports new york times on blog.
zuckerberg said that the' dislike' button will show a nuance of what a user feels rather than just an option.
however, his announcement raised the issue that facebook could become a less friendly place.
zuckerberg noted that he wants to avoid a when someone is posting on his account an important event in life and someone else will give " dislike. "
users of the network network, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long been calling for them to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or their empathy with something sad.
mark zuckerberg also said it is not very comfortable for people to give " like " to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the death of a family member.
" you may not really feel comfortable to give a bit like that posting, " the facebook representative pointed out.
a new facebook button has not been welcomed by everyone.
" there is already enough hatred on facebook and social networking networks, " commented atiq haneef of afghanistan, on the new york times facebook page, where the article was posted on the topic.
" i will give' dislike the' dislike' button, " he added.
roger anderson, a microbiologist from atlanta, has claimed that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on facebook.
debra aho williamson, social media analyst with the emarketer, noted that it was hard to imagine that a single button can pass on a complex range of negative emotions.
moreover, she argues, the election campaign in america is approaching and the' dislike' button would create a total disaster.
only 70 refugees entered hungary 24 hours
hungary accepted only 70 migrants on tuesday, a hand from thousands who came en masse to its southern border with serbia, government advisor gyorgy bakondi announced.
hungary declared a state of emergency earlier in the day in two counties along its border with serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it would build a fence on its border with romania, the dpa recalls.
the move drew a sharp reaction from serbia.
just yesterday they said that they would seal the border for those who want to pass but not for those who want to apply for asylum.
" as you see, this is totally different, " serbian refugee minister aleksandar vulin said.
before imposing the new immigration legislation, a record 5,809 migrants entered hungary on sunday, police announced on monday.
more than 170,000 immigrants from the middle east and africa entered hungary from serbia in 2015.
many avoid being registered and trying to get to the west, particularly in germany.
the " new " headquarters of the county council is typical.
two builders in insolvency
the massive investments made here in recent years to move the institution are to to come ble because they have been halted several times.
two important builders who have worked here have entered into insolvency during the work.
the seat of street county council vasile alecsandri will end up falling on its own.
a year and a half after work on consolidation and refunctionalisation of the building should have been completed, work has come as far as half.
one final stage in the building's age was consumed in recent days, when the national council for dispute resolution (cnsc) rejected a complaint by the firm that wanted to take over the contract to complete the technical project for the work that remains to be carried out.
the initial project was drawn up by impex romcatel sa.
following the builder's insolvency and the interruption of the,, negotiating procedures are under way without the publication of a participation announcement with impeimpex romcatel, with the company to update the technical project, and a new tender for works will then be held.
" but negotiations were not concluded with a contract with the cj assessing that the proposed form would put the institution at a disadvantage, razvan razvan timofciuc, who represented public relations within the cj said.
the cj decision to suspend direct negotiations was challenged in court by impex romcatel.
the extraordinary court sent the complaint to the cnsc, which rejected it as a belar.
however, this does not mean that the ecj can start looking for another planner.
impex romcatel is able to attack the cnsc's decision at the appeals court, only after a final ruling could one consider finding another desigver.
thus, work on the building could resume no later than next year.
our intention is to restart work as soon as possible.
in principle, the restoration of the technical project should not last long, but we need to come to a contract.
" we are waiting to see whether the cnsc's decision will be attacked or not, " timofciuc said.
work on the strengthening of the former headquarters of the police quaestors kicked off in 2011.
a first works contract was terminated in april 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei had been undertaken.
the tender was resumed as the contract went to moldovan construct.
but the firm went into insolvency, and the deal was terminated, after 1.5 million lei had been paid.
so far, about 50% of work has been carried out.
initially, consolidation, re-functionalisation and manitation of the building was assessed at 7.7 million lei.
" enough, i say everything! " -- the declaration that could criminalise the former cadastral head.
one of the employees involved in the cadastre office's scandalous file signed an agreement to recognise the facts, for prison with delay.
his statements will likely criminalise the other indictees, led by former head narciza nedelcu.
an adviser from the cadastral and real advertising office (ocpi) iasi charged by the dna in a corruption file has acknowledged its faps.
the agreement on recognising the facts signed by dumitru dascalu was recorded yesterday at the iasi tribunal, with judges set to provide a solution in the case on 29 september.
dumitru daniel dascalu was accused of false intellectual in continued form and agreed to execute two years in chişinău with delay, and work to benefit the community.
as for the facts attributed to dascalu, prosecutors made it clear that he, as an advisor to the cadastral office, along with other colleagues, " did not forfake a number of minutes of accepting, with prprprps carrying missing services services services formerly performed by the .p.p.iasi with the administrators of gauss srl, five srsc companies, had no real smelastre.
recent days, the office's former head, narciza nedelnedelcu, but also other former or current cpi employees, were filed on this dossier, with the charges being contempt for services to the companies mentioned, though the work has not been done.
the pre-judiciary exceeds 300,000 lei.
stone-era adventures
in president frh's view, alexandru dedu, romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and preparation of the women's handball team for qualifying the olympics costs an asset.
the president of the romanian handball federation, alexandru dedu, said at a meeting with the press yesterday that it is a great deal of pride that our country has three teams in the champions league groups.
as far as romania's national women's handball team is concerned, " the main goal is qualification for the rio olympics, but that is what two stages of lifts need to go, first the world championship and second the pre-qualification tournament, " dedu said.
it is very much for us to qualify for the olympic games.
these are fantastic requirements from tomas ryde's technical relay.
the staf will include seven or eight people.
he wants second coach, a doctor, two masses, coach of portals, a physical preparation, the head of delegation.
they asked us to obtain a number of things, namely materials for physical training, which we have never heard.
that was all to reach olympic games; and i will do everything i do to have them.
we are talking about a massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
however, that is the way for performance to be made.
because we are in the stone age at the moment of preparation.
" the teams we have been struggling with have these materials and have them for some time, " said dedu, who noted they are trying to secure the amounts needed to purchase these products from mts and cosr.
president frh also referred to infrastructure in romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
we have no hall in bucharest.
it is an infrastructure problem, and it is shameful to call a european gymnastics championship into question.
let us not forget that in other parts of the world, olympic neighbourhoods have been built in full within two years.
prior to 1992, in the current olympic area in barcelona was a waste dump, and it has now reached a beauty landmark.
this was the case in london, where organising the 2012 olympics was also successful in investment terms.
" in my view, in 2024 we can host a major competition, " dedu said.
he added that international handball bodies are willing to give romania to a major competition.
it is a priority for me to bring major handball events to romania.
mr gatu went civilised with a project, people gave their consent in principle, but it clarified very quickly that the hall would never be built.
i also had talks with ehf, i told them we wanted, that we were able to organise and they said they agreed and invite them to the first match in bucharest's new hall and then we were discussing specifically.
" so we have all the openness, and at ehf and ihf, but we don't have infrastructure, " the frh official explained.
the former great handball player avoided assessing the chances of bucharest's csm teams and hcm baia mare of finally reaching four: " i asked all coaches to be reserved if they do not return against them. "

patania
a family of tourists from cluj came to iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
after my experience, my wife, too, do not want to calm in your city any more.
without wanting, they were up against erroneous information, the lack of rapt controllers and, bonus a fine' as it were the law'.
spouses arrived in iasi a few days ago, stay at a hotel in the centre and demanded horyers of tourism.

'armed' with these maps, the husbands have visited hamas.
but two days ago, sitting in copou, they wanted to reach the palas mall.
as it was not a ticket box at the station near the copou park, they were based on printed information on plily: that they can take ticket via sms.
no one told them that this service no longer exists.
sokingly, they climbed into a bus and tried to send sms according to the instructions on the floor.
unfortunately, a team of ratp controllers has appeared.
they said that there had been no service for 2 years and that it was announced in the media that it was cancelled.
where can i know what was written in the local media, coming one evening before i visited the city?
i spoke to the controllers, i explained the situation to them, said they do not care, it is not their business.
the attitude has been very defiant.
they said all they can do is fine us with one fine instead of 2 (me and the wife).
" i paid, i did not want to call out my visiting day at the gendarmerie and giving statements there! " the ovidiu said.
in conclusion, the family has been amended because of misinformation on the leapliand controllers who " applied the law in blood. "
this is not right, and i made a complaint to ratp iasi in order to recover my money.
this is not about money, i am not exaggerating many people, but the idea is that i felt deceived ated.
bad for vaslui rapists.
accident, under preventive arrest
the trial of the seven rapists in vaslui has moved to the iasi appeal court since yesterday.
magistrates tried the first trial term at a non-public session in which seven young people accused of scorting an 18-year-old youth called for release.
before the actual start of the trial, one of the outstanding judges who had assigned the file, viorel munteanu, formulated a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues from court.
the magistrate was activated at the vaslui court until this summer, where he served as the president of the station on the nale, who, on 9 april, admitted a complaint made by four of the defendants, placing them under house arrest.
currently, the dossier is being tried by a complete that includes maricical magistrates, mititelu and getgeting.
earlier, in the dossier he formulated a abstention and judge dan an ton, on the grounds that his daughter had been in a relationship of wedlock with one of the lawyers of the rapists.
the two judges decided that the vaslui rapists should remain under preventive custody.
ti nnasts will remain imprisoned for at least another 30 days, when jucers re-discuss the possibility of placing them at large.
the trial term is expected to take place at the iassy appeals court on 6 october.
before reaching the appeals court of iasi, the duba carrying rapists from vaslui was involved in an accident in the neighbourhood of pacwish, with the car entering iasi through the belt.
autoulitara iveco carrying the seven rapists hit a car, volks wagen, which pulled from the dela sings, and the driver tried to break to the left.
the duba circulates from the end of pacwish.
the car entered iassy here because prison administration employees preferred the route from vaslui to iasi to grastables and then on the belt road.
they thus shortened the road a few kilometres.
immediately after the impact, the escort of arrests called for another shipment to take over the detainees.
shortly, a car was sent at the site of the accident from the maximum safety penitentiprison, which took over the seven detainees and carried them to the court of appeals.
following the accident, none of them were injured.
to transfer them to the other duba, the guards surrounded the back part of the mafia and arrests went to speed, two each.
" the incident was not reported to the police because drivers of those do motor vehicles understood amicably about the damage that needs to be paid, " said chief commissioner madalin taranu, of the ipj.

romania is not, nor will it be prepared, for what to come.
what about europe?
i say this from the outset, loud and clear: the 7 000 refugees they should and should naturalise to romania in itself represent an ininsignificant but huge number compared to the ability of the romanian state to manage such a project.
for romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by bucharest, in tune of around 1 500 ps, goes far beyond our good intentions of solidarity with the european union expressed in recent months.
certainly, if those migrants really accept to establish themselves in our places, the chances of integrating them quickly into romanian society are extraordinarily small.
i am convinced that they will be the first to lose patience.
crippled by mobsters and paralysed by a venal political class, the romanian state proves mired in all areas.
the failure to integrate the gypsies is just a trivial example.
apart from this, governments of any colour have not been able to absorb european funds, make roads, kindergargartens or modern schools, ensure decent health care, raise the stakes on the street, create honourably paid jobs or or keep their own young generation at home.
why should refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
but what causes a great deal of wonder is particularly the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is being dealt with.
we first strike on the rebeld rebellion of the powerful states of the eu, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
then there comes the cold hypocrisy of romanians who, although millions of relatives who are scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of blood.
fearing might not steal them off the national being.
after all, there is also hypocrisy of many migrants, although they only cite the horrors of war as a reason for departure, accept no exodus destination than germany or nordic countries.
however, not all refugees are syrians and in pakistan there is no war.
also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is being examined can only be moffed.
the causes need to be eliminated, some argue and, by playing strictly in the book of political correctness, i call for peace and investment for the migrants' countries of origin.
but in romania there is peace and even enters, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy -- but that does not prevent tens of thousands of romanians from leaving their country every year.
why?
in this crisis, the european union has been revealed to us that anchilly, torn up and outdated construction by the situation.
we deplore the fact that romania is not able to invent a country project, but here, the eu does not have any plans for the future either.
and makeshift and threats do not help anything.
what is the eu making use of, then, if the only advantage enjoyed by romanians - the right to free movement - could be called into question because of the waves of refugees who cross the borders as cheese?
at some point, the war in syria will end.
it is not the crisis of migrants, however.
over the coming decades, over-population, poverty, climate change, the depletion of resources, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from asia and especially from africa, into a better life.
with such politicians, romania is not and will ever be ready for next.

the destination
the concession tender aims for a 10-year period.

two fratists in tomesti allowed somspheres.
taken to hospital
two 9-year-old and 11 years of tomesti, brothers, swallowed several diazepam pills.
they found tillls at home and took them out of curiosity.
their mother was undergoing treatment, and the medicines were not hidden.
children were urgently taken to the " saint maria " hospital in iasi.
they are in stable condition, as doctors say.
exclusively: a heart-breaking meeting.
20 years a courageous gift: biological parents
lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the denial of the 1990s, when it had only two months of life, small, sick and helhelpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in italy, in the same years as adoption was widely regulated, a young girl, now a blile and beautiful girl, met the day before yesterday with biological parents in a village.
the crina will mark 20 years these days, and her adoptive parents in palermo thought to give their well-loved ished daughter an amazing and courageous present: a visit to romania, to iasi, to get aware of their unclear past.
the " de iasi newspaper, " which witnessed efforts for the home family after several extremely vague vague signs, witnessed these meetings that basically rust your heart.
reports to reporters, excitement, statements by those involved, their reactions are downright moving and overwhelming.
the crin's story begins 20 years ago in the rusty town of athens, when it was only two months.
then, due to a health problem then, the girl had to be admitted to hospital in the city.
misunderstandings started at home between parents, and the mother had to go.
he has decided to keep alive and for me to send me from home.
he stopped, and we have not known anything since then.
" when i learned that he was in hospital, it was too late, " reremembers hes alina alina, a biological mother of the girl.
crina was admitted with her grandmother to the pascani city hospital, and then the girl's father costica balcan left for work in teleorman county of alexandria.
their lives were definitively divided.
they never find crin at hospital
after boarding, the crin's father left for work for another village and returned six months later.
meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in iasi, and the father, when he returned, did not find her.
i think it was almost nine months since the girl was in hospital.
" i thought she was abandoned, " counts a family grandchild.
due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come to iasi, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
since no one took more interest in the fate of the child during all this time, she was taken over by the directorate-general for social welfare and the protection of the iasi child, which then gave it to care for the placement centre in bucium.
there were years when abandonment and adoption were more lax than today in romania.
at the centre of bucium was found by italy's salvadore and his wife, a couple from palermo who wanted to have their child, but did not succeed.
they fell in love with blonduta crina and had to move definitively to italy some time later.
it had already been reduced for nearly two years, as long as adoption formalities have taken.
when i saw the crin, i felt it was before us.
" as if my wife gave him his life, " says us smiling salvadore, the adoptive father, as he caught in the wihand's face of the face.
in the country, crine's parents, alina and costica, continued their searches separately, each where they could.
the father asked the authorities in the pray, but he was given no answer where his child could be.
police then told them they might die, but in iasi the parents found out what had really happened to them.
when i looked for her here, they told me to court that she was going to italy, to palermo.
and i looked for it again.
we prayed to god to be good.
i thought about it in all the years that have passed, but there have not been possibilities to mour, to find it.
" it's hard, " tears tell us in the biological mother of crin.
however, even though the years have passed, the rusty y parents were not forgotten.
in italy, salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where he comes from and that her past links it with romania.
i was small when i found out.
i think i was five or six years old.
i reacted as a copy, i was curious.
" i wanted to know my parents in romania, " i confess the spare.
and her dream was to become a reality.
in march this year, chief commissioner romica ichim, director of the regional centre for prevention, evaluation and counseling iasi, was contacted by an knowledge from italy, who explained salvadore's desire to find the crin biological family.
and the search came only from one name.
after our request from our partners in italy, we started the first steps.
we had received only one name, balcan costica, then locality, pray.
shortly, i did a job with city hall there, and i could ask whether there was in the name that has been received.
at that time they gave me a few indications, only that the person found was not the person wanted.
" it ultimately took about a month after all to find the biological father of the girl, " chief commissioner romica ichim explains.
in all, more than three months took the authorities to find costica and alina alina, especially as everyone was accommodated in another municipality.
we started work somewhere in march, and in june and july we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
" then we agreed to have a first meeting in september, " romica ichim added.
at the weekend that passed, alina and costica saw the first time their girl lost at the halls of the hospital in iasi, 20 years ago.
the father, emotional, was barely able to master his tears and his hands were never relsed.
it is barely changing a couple of words with those around it.
a week before the meeting was not even able to sleep.
he was also emotional, he was rousing.
" there's something for you in order to see your child after so many years, " says a grandwelcome, who is also from ruwly.
drc meeting with mother and brother
in talks with him, who is to study at a well rated university in italy, costica balcan told him, among other things, that if he once wants to come back to the village, to come quiet: he can give some sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and pacier a household.
my mother is also emotional, complains, and hardly believes that this can happen to her.
i am very moved.
i did not believe that this could happen.
i have seen such cases on television, i have been thinking for these years, i hoped, but i did not think i could be so.
there is a lot of emotion.
if they could forgive me.
i hope that we will visit each other in the future.
" i hope that we can keep a touch, " tells us great tears obraji alina, the mother of the drc, while keeping a serveter in hand.
he is still hiding his tears for happiness, because he will soon see himself with him after such a while.
on the other hand, crina, which will meet in just a few days' time this month 20 years, is trying to appease itself like an emotive child.
he does not know what to expect, but he has sketched out a vague idea of her biological parents.
he thinks they are young people, but they are trying to add their thoughts before the meeting because he has a great deal to say, but nothing to reproach.
my parents are two mothers and two fathers.
but my parents are, in the end, those who raised me.
it is going to be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
" i hope to have a nice memory with them because now there is so much to say, " he confesses.
first family in iasi
in the unification market, under the sky begun in the autumn, the rugy family is once again unites their fate relative to them in palermo.
the crina is 20 years ago, finishing high school based on the italian school model, but can begin a new chapter with alina and costica, her biological parents.
they no longer divide borders or countries, but only one barrier: that of language.
above which, with the help of an interpreter, an italian local owner at the centre of mine, easily passed.
those who managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first of its kind, and that, if the opportunity arises again, they will do so in the future.
it is the first event of its kind organised by such emotional cargo, and i am glad to be a success.
we at the centre have a variety of activities, and we are often associated as an institution that deals only with consumer-, people, with drug addicts.
but we are trying to bring something good back to society.
" if i am asked for such a food, i will do so with great hearts, " says smiling romica ichim, director of the regional centre for prevention, evaluation and counselling against drug iasi.
behind it, the balcan family, flown in the middle, departs itself.
i am quite understandable: they have a lot to say to each other.
a truce of weapons on the leg, yesterday in the psd.
everyone shoots their soul
camps in the emerging psd branch ended a truce on the leg.
after successive rounds of talks, held from friday to sunday, the first being the most tense, psd leaders agreed to temporarily suspend the hostilities.
pressed by the party's executive president, liviu dragnea, to present a united position, the emerging social democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for party posts.
far from over, the internal war in the party seems to have taken a break to allow combatants to fire their soul.
dragnea has not come up with an ultimatum.
it has sent a very simple and up-to message under the conditions now: you are trying to find a solution not to put the party at risk.
we have party elections on 3 october.
all functions will be made available to those who want them.
" until then, we remain in the existing structure, " said interim mayor mihai chirrilica.
the two days of talks at the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing has has been established.
fierce competition is expected in the october elections for the post of president of the psd's county branch.
on the short list of possible candidates for the top post in the party's extraordinary branch include secretary of state maricel popa, senator florin constantinescu, senator sorin lazar, county counselor vasile catea and the acting president of the county council, victorel lupu.
como schitu lead mayor mihai mihalache could be added to them.
one option under consideration is the candidate ature of psd county leader cristian stanciu, which is being considered, is the candidate of psd county councilors, cristian stanciu, in case lupu no longer goes in the race, with party party sources saying he has no interest in the post.
the only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of former branch leader, mayor gheorghe nichita.
the candidate list is open.
under the statute, including on election day, applications can be submitted, and it would not surprise anyone if they happened.
" the important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain after october 3rd, when we have a new executive office, a new permanent county office and all new governing structures, " catea said.
until internal elections are held, the leadership of the psd county branch will be secured by victorel lupu, a close to nichita and stanciu.
but lupu is on vacleave until 29 september, with election preparations practically to be secured by branch branch executive secretary with county adviser mihail popescu, a county adviser with the nichita camp.
contacted by phone, cristian stanstanciu praised the talks over the past few days as leading to " a partial consensus. "
there is a broad willingness to maintain the balance and unity within the party.
a partial consensus has been reached in support of a unit team to deal with the judge.
" but on the other hand, there are several variants regarding the intentions to join the psd iasi presidency, with the list remaining open, " stanciu commented.
prominent judge refused rapists in his boat on grounds of competition
the seven young people in vaslui convicted of rape today reach the iasi appeal court.
the vasluians ans sentenced to sentences between five years and eight months and eight months and four months will today present their arguments about putting them at large after the substantive court, the vasvaslui judgment, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentencing was issued.
the file at the appeals court late last week, with magistrate dan anton anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
anton invoked that one of the defendants' lawyers, the lawyer bogdan luca, is his daughter's competition, lawyer dana anton.
luca is defending silviu ovidiu burada, who received the highest sentence in this file.
how motivated judges
late last week, the vaslui magistrate, who sentenced the seven young people motivated the sentence.
for motivation, the judge talks about the defiant reaction of defendants, but also those who supported them, stating that such attitudes attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
" the court finds that after the time being placed under a preventive measure of judicial control the restrictive measure of freedom but not deprived of freedom, under the impact of the defendants, their families and local supporters, has been felt within the local and national community, a strong sense of indignation over the fact that people accused of serious acts are being tried to a less restrictive extent, " said the motivation for the ship's judgment.
the magistrates also dismantled the main defence of the seven defendants, who during the trial invoked that the girl they violated would not be the " door of church. "
" the court plays it is irrelevant the moral quality of the injured person, something that defendants wanted to highlight through the apparatus they formulated because a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be infringed under any pretext, " it further said.
corbyn, brexit, and the future of europe
for economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in recent decades cannot continue the same in the years to come.
until saturday, there was probably a little people in romania who jeremy corbyn is.
even today, after he became the new leader of the uk labour party, many are wondering to what extent we can affect the election of a politician who, after all, is in a decision-making position.
jeremy corbyn is the most radical clumsy leader of post-war labour.
marxist said, anti-monarchist (he one point asked tony tony blair, then the prime minister, to pull the royal family out of buckingam palace palace), a feroce terrorist movement and sympathiser of vladimir putin (it has also been regularly invited to comment on political events by the tv channel, " russia today "), and terrorist hizizbollah and hamas, to abandon britain.
for corbyn, who had at the time seen the killing of osama bin laden as a real tragedy, isis is almost preferable to the united states.
on the pattern of all populist demagogues, corbyn does, of course, have miracle anti-austerity solutions.
things like the those he was saying and promised by tsipras in greece until the time as he chindered with the real world and economic legality.
the economic programme of the new labour leader envisions, among other things, massive renationalisation and money printing as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
of course, some might wonder why the solution for money printing is not unanimously adopted across the globe, we would then have a general prosperity in the world! but who would also to de themselves from such details.
of course, we can charge bankers, you are becoming a kind of service enemies of the left, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or ecuador or venezuela, but also in france, at the mandates of mitterand and hollande.
additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous, empty promises made by populist demagogues.
as margaret thatcher rightly pointed out,' the problem of socialism is that at some point's money is over'.
few give jeremy corbyn a real chance of ever reaching prime minister.
in the early 1980s, another radical left-wing leader, michael foot, who was not as convinced in any case as the new party leader, failed miserably in the elections.
and then there is still in britain a workers' class, in the classic sense of the word that is relatively consistent and structured.
and the trade unions were more influential than they are now.
in the conditions of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the labour force, and extensive automatiation have led to a massive need for highly qualified workforce in the industry, corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
but even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
in its last number of the financial times, corbyn's election increases the chances of brexit, or britain's exit from the eu.
the new labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the union.
in the eyes of the radical left, brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed austerity on the poor.
when you combine this kind of ideas with those from the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that is shaking the foundations of the eu, to an explosive mix.
and not only for the united kingdom.
but if the british people decide in the wake of the referendum, which would take place by 2017, leave the loss of symbolic capital for the entire european project and the deep flaws created within it by the euro crisis, and now that of refugees, between north and south, between east and west, leave room for scenarios in the most worrying ones.
all the more so because for a whole number of member states, london was a counterbalance at the franco-german axis (in which berlin increasingly becomes the dominant actor).
it is true, the british business, the city, are powerful lawyers for the stay of the country in the eu.
but today's europe is no longer that of the past.
there are many resentment, which are growing in intensity in these very few weeks.
the problem is that brussels, we recently had a sample in jean clude junker's speech, is increasingly inclined to make major decisions over the head of the vast majority of member states by consulting with only a few european powers, mainly with germany.
and this is as electoral support for the anti-system, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time and eurosceptic is increasing dramatically throughout the entire continent.
in other words, the emotional uncharged climate has reached higher than ever in the past.
where does the conclusion that the financial times draw from when assessing the chances of brexit.
the pro-eu option is based on a cold calculation that moves from the national interest.
if voters make a cerebral decision, then britain will remain in the eu.
but corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
on the other hand, eastern europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
especially if, as expected, we are to see greater integration of the euro area, which will push most of the states in the region and the skirts of interest and the decision-making process in europe.
corbyn, tsipras and greece's syriza, podemos in spain, and even bernie sanders in the united states are feeding populist rhetoric from the frustration accumulated in non-socient societies.
for economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed, generous social benefits in recent decades can no longer continue the same in the coming years.
under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the euro area - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that only took into account the integrationist political ambitions, and not the capacity and willingness of european peoples and governments to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, internal tensions in the eu will only increase in intensity and seriously affect romania's situation.
and it is hard to exclude something in terms of possible scenarios.
the question is whether our main political leaders are able to handle such complicated situations.
constantin brancusi, the god taran.
rockefeller: " how can i help? "
brancusi:' take up the workshop!'
the great sculptor had a great dream: be someone, get famous, hear about him worldwide.
behind his name, however, there is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
that thing also has a name.
it is called' truda'.
what to write about constantin brancusi?
what is there, in fact, to say?
his figure appeared on notes.
and recently, a popular romanian bank hired an actor to play him in a advertising client.
brancusi produces and supplies money almost 60 years after it is no longer with us.
in romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards bearing his name.
in fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
and, when it comes out of odrasla, you are hearing the following instructions:' we are going to the park, brancusi'.
its statues are imeming the country.
there are few romanian figures whose works are known by around the world from children to the elderly.
brancusi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
the communists also failed to name it out of romania's memory and culture.
his quotations today placate the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of like and share shares.
and, then, again, what would we have to say, to write about this man?
viewed from a lot of books and articles that seek to reconstitute its destiny, cheese's life looks almost fantastic, totally probable.
you know, there are those people who tell you that, if you were not lucky to be born in any big city and in a family as well as possible, your chances of success in life are almost null.
brancusi's life is perfect.
and perhaps it would be a key here.
perhaps the forthcoming text should start here.
with a ruling, however detestable they are.
forget the cretine success stories, which are delivered to you daily to newspapers and on tv.
take a close look at the figure of this man.
do you want to know how he has succeeded in life, how, today, he has heard a whole world?
it is simple.
he has worked for his entire life to be someone.
it did.
constantin brancusi is born on 19 february 1876 in hobita, a small fish common village, gorj county, at the carpathians pes.
it is the fifth child of maria and radu nicolae brancusi.
although he came from a well-lustling family, cheese is living a modest life, but one of which he was going to reape the marks that will guide his late artistic vision.
recalling his childhood and places he grew up, the artist was to confess, at a meeting with petre tutea in paris in 1933: " then life was beautiful and harmonious. "
people happily led a patriarchal life for millennia.
everything was quietly from one seasons to another.
and do you know why things have changed?
the civilisation of the great city has come to us.
brancusi's childhood was far from idyllic however.
one of the moments in these first years of life is highly suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterised his future sculptor or years spent in his native village.
the moment is being reproduced in the work " cheese. " a biography " written by alexandru buican.
in 1879, constantin brancusi was 3.
in the autumn of that year, when it was being peted " at cazan, " watching those who taste the liquid to see if the process is proceeding in the right way, cheese is catch a moment of general unattention.
it fills its palaces with tuica and drink on breathated.
it falls into almost instantly.
it is only the first people to notice after a few minutes.
the mother goes into panic, then in hysteria, believing that her son died.
late evening, when father, radu, returns from life accompanied by laari, he sees from the distance the desperate signs of those who kindly expect him at his breath.
the party immediately turns into jale.
the father is already thinking about burying the patient.
however, someone finds that it is good to call baba brandusa, dofroea and servant of cheese.
cheese check children's breath, then put them under the horse-collected balega ncollected from the floor.
the strong child.
applauds.
while the boy is left to sleep his bey, joy, spending with greries continues with more force.
the next day, father and son meet through livada.
radu brancusi puts constantin to gather some nuts and bring them.
the father treats his child with his head on the head down and, with the feuds made by the boy, beats him to bear in mind.
and, while he feels the bite of blows, small small cheese has revelation that the world can be viewed from another perspective and that things around can be overturned.
especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him ask himself, as he had to admit in the old age, if not astral itself participated in his disorder.
should he have been the sun as disturbed as his father by what had happened?
town currently does not work
an mp calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
independent deputy viorel blajut called on the psd and pnl to stop infighting and refocus their agenda towards the electorate.
what we see now on our political scene is a great division and that.
we have seen nothing of the 2012 usl projects to continue.
neither the highway, nor the urgent regional hospital, see only how politicians dispute their possible sites according to real estate interests.
let us leave some politics aside, sit together and talk.
at the moment, the city is not working.
" if you are dealing with internal war, you have no time for those who elected you, " blajut said.
he said the current political class disappointed emerging voters, resulting in a very low turnout in the upcoming local elections, around the 30% figure, effectively representing the parties' staunch electorate.
the member also believes that voters will also turn to the traditional parties, expressing reservations about new political initiatives, such as the " for iassy " party that will be launched today.
the local parties stand a very small chance and will only break the electorate of the right, not of the psd.
such parties are based on civic active people, who as a rule are on the right.
" the right is further deceaating, which is not good for anyone, nor for the psd, " blajut said.
he made it clear that he is not interested in an candidacy in the upcoming local elections, denying rumours of his intention to run for the mayoral race.
i also said that i do not want to run for any local office.
i also consider whether to continue as an mep and next term.
i have tried to call for unity for the iassy and discussions in holuri, with other parliamentarians, and i was accused of wanting to paint my image.
i do not want, but we cannot go on like this.
" if people voted for us, it does not mean that they are fools to vote if they don't see anything, " said blajut, who assessed that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the alps.
a colleague from tatarasi said he was not getting his money and he has to go by bus.
let us be hypocritical.
there is little money.
sometimes i am ashamed to raise money from the dog.
at the end of my mandate i will report on everything that i have spent, besides the salaries of cabinet employees and its maintenance.
i happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport accounts, accommodation and the others.
" telling an mp that he does not get his money is clean hypocrisy, " the blajut ended.
