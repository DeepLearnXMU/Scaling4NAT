un chief says military solutions in syria
secretary-general ban ki-moon says his response to russia's military support for syria is that " there is no military solution " to the conflict that has been going on for nearly five years, and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
the un chief has again urged all parties, including the divided un security council to unite and support negotiations in order to find a political solution.
ban said at a conference wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present in the council this month -- the us, russia, china, england and france -- on the general assembly's ministerial session to discuss syria.
ban voiced regret that divisions in the council and between the syrian people and regional powers " have made this situation unresolved. "
ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in syria.
8 poll figures showing donald trump has a real chance
some tried to label him as a " lip-fp " politician.
others called a joke.
and others are waiting for implosion.
but regardless of how some republican ans are trying to remove donald trump from the top of the polls, it has not worked (yet).
ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that donald trump leads to two figures, and some are starting to seriously question what this means for the chances of appointing the real estate mogul.
of course it is still premature.
none of this says the trump will win the race for nominating the republicans.
pundits shows that during the same period of 2011, rick perry's advancement made room for herman cain in the polls, but none of them won any country in the nomination race.
and the reasons why it would fight hard in the general elections are many.
but outside groups such as jeb bush's super cap and the conservative economic group club for growth admit trump's power and are beginning to support it with money.
we are still presenting to you some figures in recent polls suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just something passing:
figures indicating trump support returned to 180 degrees.
even before donald trump announced his candidacy in mid-june, a poll by monmouth university shows that only two out of 10 republics had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
by mid-july, the percentage moved to 40%.
in early august, it was 52 per cent.
currently, six out of 10 republics are favourable about donald trump.
about three out of 10 say they negative.
these figures.
a poll last week by quinnipiac in iowa concluded that 60% of the regional republics have a favourable view of trump.
two thirds of gop voters would be happy if trump won the nomination race.
in a poll by cnn / orc last week, 67% of the republics said they would be " enthusiastic " or " satisfied " if the trump won the nomination race.
only two out of 10 say they would be " upset " if trump won the nomination race.
ben carson alone generates about the same level of enthusiasm as the trump (43% says he would be " enthusiastic " about 40% that say the same about the trump).
closest in terms of enthusiasm?
marco rubio, with only 21%.
on the other hand, 47% of republican voters say they would be " dissatisfied " or " upset " if favourite jeb bush wins the nomination race.
most republics do not consider trump's temperature a problem.
although donald trump has been strongly criticised for his insults and bombastic style, 52% of national republican voters believe the real estate mogulgul has the right temperature to be president, according to a poll conducted by abc news / washington post on monday.
we find the same figures in the state of iowa, where also 52% of the republicans believe trump has the right personality to be leader, according to a poll by quinnipiac last week.
however, 44% believe he does not have the personality to act effectively and almost six out of 10 independents say his temperature has no place at the white house, according to the abc / post.
republican voters are getting used to the idea.
when intellectuals, republican voters consider the trump authentic.
according to a poll by cnn / orc last week, the question who has the most chance of winning the gop nomination race, four out of 10 said trump.
the situation has changed since the end of july, when four out of 10 would have bet on jeb bush.
full information: in the past, gop voters have not read the future very well.
during the same election period, four out of 10 republicans elected rick perry in the nomination race to only 28% for mitt romney.
but these figures show that the majority of gop voters consider trump's campaign plausible.
even though the republicans or returned to another candidate; trump still leads everyone.
some say the divided situation will likely help trump's victory, while supporting trump will split to more than twelve candidates.
but an early september poll by the university of monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of collaboration between trump and most other republican candidates, almost always trump will receive majority support.
trump is 13 points carly fiorina, at 14 points from marco rubio, at 15 points of walker at 19 points of jeb bush and, finally, 33 points each from a row paul, john kasich and chris christie.
it is almost on an equal footing with ted cruz.
is the only candidate to defeat it?
ben carson would beat businessman with 19 points in a one-one hypothetical confrontation.
donald trump's supporters say they decided.
a new poll conducted by cbs / nyt on tuesday shows more than half of voters supporting trump says they is not changing their voting option.
obviously, much can happen and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing its option.
however, trump's most important adversary is currently ben carson neurosurgeon, but it is twice voters who say they have decided to vote with trump.
six out of 10 republicans say they agree with the trump on immigration.
since donald trump appointed immigrants from mexico " rapators " in his opening speech of his campaign two months ago, immigration was the central topic in the 2016 campaign.
some are concerned that trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between key hispanici voters and the republican party and harm rebranding efforts.
but according to the abc / post poll on monday, six out of 10 republicans say they agree with trump on immigration.
so it seems that as long as the immigration problem remains in the spotlight, so will doland trump.
frustration with authorities reaches new colours.
donald trump and ben carson are now supported by nearly half of republican voters, largely because of their outsent status.
according to a poll conducted by abc / post on monday, six out of 10 republicans say they prefer a political outsider at the expense of someone with government experience.
people also upset washington.
a two weeks ago in iowa by often moines register / bloomberg said three out of iowa republican ans are frustrated with the performance of the congress republics, with 54% saying " dissatisfied " and 21% " nervous in colours. "
jeremy corbyn makes debut at prime ministry's questions
since his election, the start of mr corbyn in pmqs has been long-awaited.
the new leader of the labour party, jeremy corbyn, will make his debut at prime ministry's questions later, facing david cameron for the first time.
mr corbyn will ask the first of the six questions he is entitled shortly after noon; his performance will probably be closely examined by the media and labour parliamentarians.
in weekly appearances, he called for " less theatre and more facts. "
he also said he could give up some participation and give in to his colleagues.
the confrontation will be mr corbyn's first parliamentary test, coming after calling a " phantom cabinet " and after his speech at the annual tuc congress tuesday.
meanwhile, the leader of the labour party's decision to remain silent on the news of the national anthem as part of a service held tuesday on the 75th anniversary of the battle of england drew criticism from some conservative mps and made the front page.
mr corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
a spokesman for mr corbyn said he' respectfully silent' and recognised the' heroism of british air forces in the battle of england'.
but a member of mr corbyn's ghost cabinet, owen smith, told the bbc's second's newsnight that he would have recommended on the labour leader to play the national anthem " regardless of " his belief that monarchy should be abolished.
around a dozen ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of mr corbyn's leading team, arguing by differences of opinion on the economy, defence and foreign, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported it as a leader.
bbc political correspondent robin brant says policy differences " cumulate " in the labour party after mr corbyn's appointment of his position towards the european union and the benefits limit.
mr corbyn said at the tuc conference that the labour party would make changes to eliminate the idea of limitation in full.
a few hours later, mr smith, the minister for labour and pensions, stated that the party' is very clear' in exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the' cap' level from 26.000 to 23.23.000.
mr corbyn will be the fifth labour leader facing david cameron in the gallery in the last decade since he assumed the conservative party leadership.
the labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has ideas' from foreign sources' for questions to ask mr cameron and that he has received more than 3000 suggestions.
mp islington north said pmqs involves too high a level of confrontation and would refrain from shocks and attacks, pledging to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
mr corbyn said that angela eagle, the finance minister, would take his place in pmqs when he cannot participate - for example, when mr cameron moves abroad.
he also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying he has addressed chamber of deputies president john bercow to discuss this.
when he took the lead in 2005, mr cameron said he wanted to give up the' punch and judy' political style often associated with pmqs, but acknowledged several years later that he failed to take his action.
since the first transmission, in 1990, pmqs has been seen as a key barometer of a leader's rationale, the way in which it heads the chamber of deputies and its position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics say it has become a caricature and that it needs deep reform.
'job ton framework': homeless young people receive photo courses
it is difficult to be homeless in johannesburg.
but a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way of learning a profession and earn a living.
" he was shot in the job " is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless people from photographs of areas they live and earn money from it.
bbc news met with one of the project's first graduates.
jd sports chief could harm enlargement
jd sports president peter cowgill says an increase in the minimum wage in britain could mean " greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers. "
however, the purchasing power is unlikely to exceed higher labour costs in the firm, he says.
costs could have an impact on jd sports's enlargement plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
tennis australia president thanasi kokkinakis steve healy
thanasi kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticised for his behaviour.
thanasi kokkinakis has been the collateral victim in the " storm " around his friend nick kyrgios, and his behaviour deserves words of praise rather than criticism in the opinion of tennis australia president steve healy.
kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called " special ks, " has been unpleasant dragged in light of the spotlight by the scandalous derapy kyrgios had towards stan wawrinka to the montreal masters tournament.
in a qualification fqualification match played shortly after, five five years, the seat referee had to intervene twice to disconnect kokkinakis and opponent ryan harrison, after which harrison said " wawrinka should have put kyrgios on his knees. "
although it was last seen as a dust rocket after crampe muscular and missed a possible us open tournament, upset richard gasquet, kokkkinakis was firmly defended by healy.
the teenager is currently in glasgow, where he battles sam groth for second place individually after bernard tomic at the davis cup semifinal against england.
" one thing i feel strong is that, in my opinion, thanasi has been attracted a little into the conflict, " healy said.
the truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused crampe in us, but he is not the first player to break a rocket from frustration with himself, and i know thanasi well enough to know he would not be proud of that.
but let us be serious, he has permeined extremely well in quite provocative situations in us with harrison and so on, and i think it deserves a great deal of trust.
it has an extraordinary team, it has a great family together and i think it has been treated unfairly.
he is a 19-year-old very mature, he works hard and integrated the team, he has had no conflict with the other players, he is very respected in the west, he is in an excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young man and i think he deserves to be tried solely on his qualities and defects.
the healy also backed the decision not to take kyrgios into account for the key milestone match, which begins friday, and described the " joint decision " as the most appropriate for all, but backed the long-term player's return in canberra's return to the team.
" first of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the recount match and not to think at all about the controversy around [kyrkyrgios], " healy said.
and i think nick moved bed very quickly, as people such as federer and murray said, he matures under public eyes and made some terrible mistakes and deserves criticism, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his facts and i think he needs a time when he is not at the centre of attention so that it can reflect well and for the team.
2016 elections: hillary clinton's advantage over bernie sanders shrunwed to half in national polls.
former secretary of state hillary clinton still has a two-figures lead in the national candidacy race, but senator bernie sanders is gaining ground.
clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
vice-president joe biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15% of democratic voters.
at least five months before the start of the primary elections, the majority of democratic voters say it is too early to say they were decided on their candidate.
but clinton's supporters are more firm in choosing than supporters of other candidates.
compared to the cbs news poll last month, clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while sanders won several per cent.
clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has narrowed.
support among men has narrowed considerably and sanders are only 5 points away.
clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now equal with sanders.
however, clinton is still benefiting among elderly voters.
last month, clinton is before sanders, with two figures, among liberals, but sanders now has a slight 5-point advantage in this group.
about half of national democratic voters say she would enthusiastically support clinton if she chose to run on behalf of the party.
a quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15 per cent would support it just because it represents the party.
six per cent would not support it.
perhaps unsurprising, clinton's current supporters are likely to be enthusiastic about her election is high.
opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support clinton -- only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
while 48% of democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support clinton, the number of republican voters who say the same about first-ranked, donald trump (35%) is lower.
when clinton's supporters asked an open question about why she would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has adequate experience (16%), followed by the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the post (10%).
clinton's supporters also mention her association with bill clinton (9%).
the agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
with the vice-president considering a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although one third believe he should not run.
in the question of the second option for the party representative, democratic voters mostly call biden.
of clinton's supporters, more than half say biden would be the second option, well ahead of sanders.
if biden decides not to run for the democratic party race, hillary clinton's advantage over sanders is growing, from 20 points with biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of democratic voters consider clinton the most likely candidate to win the general elections; but the figures dropped from 78% they were last month.
biden is second away, however, the percentage that he is most eligible has increased.
however, when asked what is most important for an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer issues instead of eligibility.
as last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters unacceptable as a party representative in the presidential race.
democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well in terms of some key characteristics towards their party's primary voters.
most voters see clinton, sanders and biden as full and reliable and with solid leadership qualities.
biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity, while clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not think h. clinton is integrated and reliable, twice as many as those who say this about sanders (15%), but 27% do not think it on this.
democratic voters also generally believe that the three, clinton, sanders and biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
on all this, about a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion on sanders.
how questions persist about the use of a personal email address and a server by hillary clinton when she was secretary of state, the majority of democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject and say she did not affect their general opinion on the candidate.
but things are different among the us public.
half of americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
public opinion was divided in march on the issue, shortly after the issue came to light.
most americans say the controversy over the email has not affected their general opinion on clinton, although 36% say they have changed their negative negatively.
mainly the republics, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their opinion on clinton in the negative sense.
although democratic voters see clinton integrate and trust, this issue continues to raise its problems among voters in general: only 32% see it as integrated and reliable, 8% less than last month, and 15% less than in may.
62% of voters do not consider it and reliable.
at the same time, 55% of national voters do not consider trump integrated and reliable.
however, both clinton and trump have white ball for leadership.
of the six candidates assessed, biden, carson and bush are ranked the first in terms of integrity.
the number of those who consider sanders integration higher than those who disagree, but as with carson, many have no opinion on him.
the margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
five members indicted for murder of 1 student at baruch faculty
nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the pocono mountains in pennsylvania, five people were accused of the murder.
members of the pi delta psi at new york baruch faculty brutally attacked chun " michael " deng during an initiation ritual in september 2013 and postponed taking him to hospital, contributing to his death, according to police.
official sources say the victim was tied to the eye, was put a 14kg of sandy rucsac behind him and has been tlied repeatedly while trying to move towards a target on frozen land.
mr deng accused headaches after which he has lost his knowledge.
delta psi brotherhood members did not sound the emergency number after he fainted and claim to have waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.
but they have found the time needed to change deng's clothes, seek symptoms of google and contact national brotherhood president andy meng to ask his advice, police chief chris wagner said at a press conference.
" at this moment, members have started hiding personal goods and effectively put the good of the brotherhood before michael deng's good, " wagner said.
it could not be revived and died the second day in the morning.
according to an autopsy report, deng suffered repeated head tramas, trunchi and coapse.
" too many families have been devastated by the frrituals since 1970, at least one student has lost his life every year due to rituals, " doudouglas fierberg, lawyer for deng's family, said in a statement.
brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
the monroe district grand jury recommended that the top five members be charged with three-degree crime.
thirty-two other meries of the brotherhood, including mr meng, will also be indicted for ultraj and complicity in the murder.
" we want to hold not only the people involved but, if there is an organisation that authorised brotherhood, officially or informally, we will also hold it accountable, " wagner said at a press conference tuesday.
the baruch faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representative.
that is what will happen when the federal reserve increases interest rates.
the interest rate will rise and the bull market (growing market) will potick, bond profitability will increase and the economy will enter into recession.
that is what we know.
what we do not know is how long it will happen and how long it takes.
in the economy, history offers few signs of occupation over time.
after the first increase in the interest rate, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
the aggression of the federal reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
that is why us central bank officials have been so strongly emphasised that investors should not focus on when interest rates are beginning, but on the trajectory of time needed to normalise.
indeed, many variables are at stake.
in the end, however, the market players could see that all the stir about an interest rate increase has been exaggerated.
" the first increase in the interest rate decided by the edf after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the era " cheap money, " julian jessop, chief economist at capital economics, said in a note to customers.
on the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of us interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
it cannot be said, however, that there will be no effects.
we continue to present how several sectors of the economy could react based on historical trends:
given the situation that the market has experienced in recent months, anticipation of an interest rate increase can volatile things up for a time.
however, at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
" it seems that there is a trend that the profitability of capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which can once again reflect deforestation in monetary policy, " deutsche bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after edf increases.
specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by around 14 per cent - moving towards higher interest rates, quite invariable over the 250 days after (the average climation of 2.6%) and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on barron by the chief veen management strategy.
deutsche has said the impact on actions tends to become pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle, and the benefits are beginning to fall.
the recession is a reality of economic life, but the increase in the interest rate often contributes to it.
in the current situation, the edf faces conditions that did not exist before and could speed up a recession.
more specifically, gross domestic product will move closer to its historic minimum point for an increase in the edf's interest rate.
according to deutsche bank, out of 118 interest rate increases after 1950, only twice nominal gdp was less than 4.5%.
even though in the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to edf atlanta.
raising the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise the question " whether this time it is different, " deutsche said.
market players also prepared this year for a growth decision from the edf, with all eyes being focused at this week's meeting of the state open market commission, which ends on thursday.
although many strategists and economists believe that fomc could approve an increase in interest rates at this meeting, term transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
" in our study after 1950, all cycles to increase interest rates to date have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with gdp eclipping before the recession very quickly after recovery began, " the report said.
on the contrary, this has been a strange recovery of slow after the worst recession in the period under consideration.
the current cycle is by far the longest awaited by the edf since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months and it reached 74 months and continues.
fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase and the printing is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
the main difference is that the impact is faster in case of bonds than in the case of actions when the edf amends politics.
in the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits are changing direction once the first growth / decrease in the cycle occurs.
at the end of the interest rate growth cycle, bond profitability is falling immediately, " deutsche said.
strategies charles schwab believe that these interest rate increases will bring about profitability between short-term and long-term bonds closer, apluring the curb.
high-cost bonds are doing better in such an environment, although " we are still cautious about forcing profitability, " kathathy jones, fixed income analyst within schwab, said in an analysis.
interestingly, jones is of the opinion that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of edf policy.
" besides the power of the dollar and lowering estimated inflation, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy, " jones wrote.
short-term interest rates have increased, curbing profitability is fairer, the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the edf tightens politics.
overall, majority-working companies in the us will benefit from an interest rate increase and local products will become more attractive.
high-debt multinationals will suffer because rising the dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
" history shows that " quality " stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months after an initial interest rate increase, " analyst goldman sachs said in a customer report.
strong balance sheets exceeded those with a poor balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
large capital companies and low volatility stocks have also exceeded similar lower-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 percentage points), respectively.
debt will become important.
companies with a large percentage of fleet debt have the most to lose, goldman says.
consumers will also benefit from the dollar increase.
those saving could also benefit, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
bbc radio 3 is a copy after fm classic ics, says parliament member andrew bingham
conservative mp andrew bingham criticised radio for " stupid "
he says increasingly similar to trade opponent
bbc music awards eye eye, saying they angered brits awards
colleague damien collins attacked the voice, calling the show original.
bbc radio 3 is " turning into " classic fm, a senior mp said, putting pressure to prove that he is doing something that trade posts are not doing.
conservative mp andrew bingham also told bbc heads that " prostse " public radio and increasingly resembles the trade opponent.
" i have the impression that radio 3 " prostsi " -- although i don not like using the floor -- but i have the impression it is turning into the fm classic, " he said.
it also watched the bbc music awards, launched last december.
the bbc music awards, launched last year, appear under another name.
so, if you try to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that only copy what already exists on the market, " mr bingham said.
the bbc director-general denied the accusations, saying bbc radio 3 is well outside his trade opponent in terms of live music and public education.
i will learn nowhere about classical music from radio 3.
and his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
" moreover, i think radio 3's commitment to discover new music and allocate new plays is also important, " he said.
in the first part of this year, bbc radio 3 editor alan davey said he must do more to draw the previous period because the british have less knowledge of classical music.
but radio 3 was not the only element under the bbc logo criticised at a meeting of the committee on culture, media and sports for going down the footsteps of its trading rivals.
conservative mp damien collins attacked the voice -- the bbc's talent show from dutch producer talpa media for about gbp 22 million.
do you understand why there is often discussions on that because it is not original and does not distinguish itself by anything?
lord hall insisted that the bbc1 show -- having paloma faith and boy george in juriu -- be conducted " in a bbc-specific manner. "
he added that he wants the corporation " to find gold egg egg in his own ography " next time he launches a entertainment show.
however, he refused to ban in the future taking new seasons from the voice or spend money on licenses on other entertainment facilities.
internet sales register lowest in august, face black friday
in the first three months of 2015, online sales rose 7%.
over the last month, there has been the slower growth since 2000 to date.
online sales gained momentum three years ago, due to mobile phone use to shopping.
specialists say black friday in november could lead to reluctance.
for more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned the commercial streets of britain into phantom cities.
specialists, however, say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating only 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
the total money spent in august presented the lowest growth since 2000, with an increase of only 5 per cent over the past year.
specialists say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating only 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
" if we look at the level of growth in previous years and return to 2000, there was always a tendency of rationalised over time, " imrg sales index editor andy mulcahy told the guardian.
he explained that online sales gained momentum three years ago, when purchasers started using the mobile phone to shop.
thus, the number of people who could make online purchases and do so under various circumstances, such as rowing.
but now that it is stagnating a little, you could see a decrease (in growth).
the black friday phenomenon, imported from america, is cited as one of the reasons for declining sales.
in the specialists' view, buyers would refrain from making purchases ahead of the event on the past friday in november.
last year, five times the average number of buyers collapsed in front of computers to put their hands on offers, leading to the collapse of several retailers.
specialists say black friday, when shoppers beat bargains, could lead to the reluctance of shoppers.
a study published by british retail consortium determined that at least 1 out of 5 is spent online.
in the case of certain products, such as television and washing cars, more than a third of purchases are currently being made via online shops.
at the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and online shoshoes rather than to turn to fashion shops in commercial areas.
after sanctions against the bin laden family, muslims bury victims killed as a result of the collapse of cranes in mecca
the bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walk to muslim streets, with the first funeral held in mecca.
saudi arabia partly blamed construction giant saudi binladin group for collapse.
health minister said a total of 394 people were injured following cranes's collapse
at the walk ceremony on the street, hundreds of muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed due to a collapsed crcranes at the mecca mosque.
dressed in white, those complaining about their death joined on the road in expressing their condolences until the first dead reached the end of the final trip at the al-moaissem cemetery.
sad sad memory of holy place, where a construction crashed through the mosque's site just a few days ago, falling believers.
the bodies were released for the funeral after saudi arabia's king sanctioned the bin laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also resulted in 394 injured.
at the street ceremony, hundreds of muslims gathered to burbury the 29 victims, killed due to a collapsed cranes at the mecca mosque.
the victims included four children's father, qasim akram in bolton, great manchester, in his first pilgrimage when the crcher collapsed.
mr akram is in the great mosque with his parents before the start of annual hajj pilgrigriage.
saudi authorities have already pledged that hajj pilgrige in mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still there.
today, king salman said that the binladin group should not have left the high slaughter arm when the slaughter was not in operation.
an arab version of the decree, published by the saudi news agency, said the binladin group partly bears the blame for collapse.
the news agency's english service did not present the detail, but said company leaders were banned from leaving the country.
earlier this week, salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the butchal in the court of the large mosque, where hundreds of thousands of muslims came ahead of hajj pilgriinage later this month.
the binladin group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the butanes, and group representatives could not be contacted for statements.
the royal decree blamed the group for not using up up-to-date safety measures and did not coordinated its work with meteorological authorities.
dozens of cranes surround the mecca mosque, as part of the massive construction effort led by the binladin group.
for decades, the binladin family has had a close relationship with saudi arabia's royal family and has been carrying out major construction projects.
the latest leader of qaida, osama bin laden, was a " reneged son, " disinherited by the family in the 1990s.
the collapse occurred in strong wind and rain conditions, just days before millions of people arrived on the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, a key journey at least once in the lives of every muslim physically pressed.
authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
authorities decided that relatives of deceased victims should receive one million saudi (gbp 174 000) and the same amount pay pay those with permanent injuries.
other injured will receive half of that amount.
advantages, disadvantages credit conversion into swiss francs
two offers for conversion into credit lei into swiss francs have already appeared on the banking market, with the main advantages being to exclude the currency risk and reduce rates.
the disadvantages can come in a few years' time, when the variable interest can lead to higher rates.
the transylvania bank has just completed the credit conversion into francs granted by volksbank, and the bankpost announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
according to cumulative data by analysts from the financial portal finzoom, the bankpost offers three years of fixed interest at lei of 1.5%, the lowest in the market.
on the other hand, the transylvania bank's offer to conversion was accepted by 83% of customers with loans in francs due to two successive cuts: the balance with the value of risk and administration fees paid by the customer, then an additional 22.5% reduction in the lei has been applied.
both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, to as they paid equivalent monthly in the lei before conversion.
thus, the transylvania bank is reducing the rate by 42.5% and bankpost, by 33% in the first three years and theoretically by 18% in the coming years.

the main advantage of the weather in credit credit in the chf is that foreign currency risk is being eliminated, with the consumer protected by future franc increases, and credit repayment will be made in the currency in which he collect his salary.
another major advantage of both offers of conversion is that property reassessment is not carried out, no additional guarantees and another proof of revenues are being required.
in practical terms, no new financial and legal analysis of credit will be conducted, nor will there be additional costs as in the case of refinancing.
both banks also offer a reduction at the monthly rate, compared to lei equivalent to customers paid before conversion.

the problem is that the early years rate is made more of interest, and the customer repaying very little mainly.
the offer of very low interest-interest bankpost in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
it is not known, however, how this interest will develop after three years.
the margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25%, so overall and cost reduction is lower.
a possible risk to all credits in variable interest lei is for the robor index to rise significantly in the coming years (more than the libor-chf) index.
for example robor at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 reached 6% in 2009 more than 15% and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
in addition, other costs may also arise, not mentioned in the initial offer.
the time for decisions on the us federal reserve interest rate
the world is looking at a meeting scheduled in two days' time, wednesday and thursday, when the us federal reserve will make a crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
in a reuters poll with the participation of 80 economists, just over half last week thought the decision would be made, i now believe that the situation will remain some time and that interest rates would be kept within the current range of 0-0.25%.
this is an historic event because seven years have passed since the federal reserve brought rates zero.
for the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up zero and initiate a process of normalising interest rates, " said angel ubide, chief analyst at peterson institute for international economics.
the us economy has evolved relatively well, with recovery bringing $trillion into the balance sheet and generating a level of low inflation.
however, the federal reserve must not ignore the global situation that is less rosy.
he has warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
the decision will be announced on tuesday, 20: 00 tec.
stars who lost their charming
actor (left), along with his son redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
in 2001, he fought leukemia and in 2009 lost his life partner, farrah fawcett, in the face of cancer.
the actor is also rumoured to have faced drug consumption and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
all this certainly has a cost.
manchester united player luke shaw has been sitting on bara for months because of double fractuures.
luke shaw suffered a double fracture on his right leg in manchester united's champions league match that ended with a defeat over psv eindhoven.
after the event that brought tears into the player's eye and will keep bara for at least six months, louis van gaal remains optimistic that shaw will be able to play this season again.
the injury came following an reckless intervention by héctor moreno in the 15th minute, after shaw, 20, broke up psv defence.
he received medical care for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before taking to hospital.
van gaal said, " he has double fracture on the leg and is in hospital. "
it will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps day after it will then be operated in manchester.
it is appalling - a boy who came to manchester united when he was 18 years old, has difficulties, then he plays fantastic, and now that is happening.
in the west, he was a mask of oxygen.
.
i am not a doctor, but at the double fracture it is six months and will not play in the group phase.
i hope it will be able to play this season again.
it seems that moreno has had good luck and has escaped the red card and the concession of a penalty coup.
referee nicola rizzoli has not punished mexican.
van gaal suggested the italian official wrong.
you can judge themselves when i say that it is a foul and card of red card.
it was a very ugly intervention, with two legs.
a message on shaw's twitter account:' thank you all for the messages, i do not have words to express how weakened i feel, i am starting the road to recovery, i will come back more strongly'.
similar news: luke shaw's manchester united hit in psv defeat
the england team's defender has another reason to recover to play at the european championship in france next june.
phillip cocu, coach psv, said, " it is a very ugly injury. "
everyone is very sad when a player is suffering from such an injury.
our players never seek to injured an adversary.
moreno broke his leg by playing for mexico's national against the national of the netherlands led by van gaal at the 2014 world championship.
" it is very difficult for him because he did not intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it is a very serious injury, it is not good, " cocu said.
i have not seen.
i only managed to see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [moreno] reached it, but i could not see the intervention on luke.
in the sbs6 statement, moreno said:' i know how it is, i know how difficult it is to pass.
i feel bad, i am sorry.
psv player andrés guardado also hospital after intervention from chris smalling.
adam lyth clearly sked england omission, but still remains high
the victory over pakistan in the united arab emirates is a difficult task but after seeing england's team for the tournament, i am not considering a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
i would not eliminate any option of travel victory.
alastair cook's team has less experience than three years ago, but it has good players in the battle line and collective morale is strong; they will not be increased by the 2012 events but will have a positive attitude to youth.
moetali is evolving as spinner and adil rashid, even though he is unknown to the level of testing, is an option for the attack.
similar topics: adam lyth leaves england team for test matches, replaced by alex hales
obviously, as his leading coach in yorkshire, it is difficult for me to look at the decision not to select adam lyth on the team.
he played the seven test matches against two good assailants under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are on trial by the results.
there were no questions about joe root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and i said before - the players are their own selection.
a fifty years' time and perhaps lyth would have extended his run, but his destiny is in his hands.
i hope that if more run for yorkshire will have other opportunities.
the main coach of the england team, trevor bayliss, praised his attitude even when the performance was not in line with his capacity, and it does not surprise me that; above all, he is a team man.
it is hard to answer the question how long a batsman is noted in test matches.
lyth had seven run -- like sam robson before him -- while nick compton had nine.
only compton had good luck at home and travel.
the only dissatisfaction you can have was that england preferred jonathan trott on the caribbean tour - when lyth was in the maximum form - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
alex hales comes the team, a batsman i see very well.
he is a cricket player who has " factor x " and i noticed early in yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a pitch trent bridge.
at least the same opportunity should be given as those ahead of it, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the uae team.
the idea of moetopening beating alongside cook was launched, which would take extra spinner keeping four quiches, and i have nothing against it.
i do not see why a chargeur could not strike there and this clumsy player has already shown that he is given naïve.
moeteen may not bring success to his district, worcestershire, but it was no 3 for them, so the difference is not big.
my old team colleague, justin langer, played his first 38 test matches 38 as first drop before entering the open in 2001.
it immediately deleted three centuries and did not look behind.
zafar ansari team to the back-up spinner post and, although i had limited contact with him, he struck me of being a very impressive young man.
people could judge early's age -- with an average of 31 to death and 35 in the ball -- and might think it is, but there is no lot of thorny and the selection opted for youth.
it will learn a great deal from this tournament.
england has also made some changes to the training team as well.
mahela jayawardene, sri lanka's batsman, as consultant for test matches could be a major blow.
it is one of the best players and it will bring a great deal of experience, given that it has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
paul collingwood comes to the tournament's white-ball leg and will bring both energy and ruthless ambition.
i have always thought he was born to get involved in the international cricket, whether as a player or as coach, and like mahela, has a intuition.
sometimes, new voices in the west, even if they send messages that have been sent even before, can bring fresh air to the team.
colly durham's teammate ben stokes rest for one-day matches, root received a similar break against australia and i have no problem with that.
although i do not all agree, coaches and selection do not make the programme.
and you have to bear in mind, jobs of players depend on the results they achieve.
such decisions are never easy.
brexit camp could win if economy remains in fta by 2017
every day he passes, the strategy for renegotiating david cameron to keep britain into the eu is getting ever more into the mess, even without the election of jeremy genius yes or no? " corbyn at the helm of the labour party or tuc brings serious criticism of europe on tuesday.
foreigners also have figures such as corbyn and nigel farages.
a european diplomat explained in recent days that -- submerged in crises similar to that in the eu -- not all being caused internally -- some member states are fuelled by britain's agenda by concessions and changes to the treaties, which most do not want.
in brighton, at its annual meeting, the tuc decided that they do not want it either if they erode social protection.
we could even call it dave and george' sel' agenda.
the prime minister and the chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, make a picture before a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and say they won allies for reform.
it is just about me.
my european friend, who wants britain looking outwards under the eu roof -- " do not leave us with france alone, " berlin says -- suggests that several narrow ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they do not care whether they remain or leave.
highly cautious german chancellor angela merkel is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave her position before her situation shaines, as happened with thatcher (11 years), mitterrand (14) and kohl (16), who have been too much.
french president françois hollande in 2017 will be re-elected or replaced.
his power, too, is in decline.
poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, left-wing spain.
it is hard to believe that they will help the english, whose energy would be better used to prevent scotland from leaving britain - something that they do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
thus, some ministers could even plan to make remarks that do not help, in the snp style, in the campaign for the uk referendum in 2017 to speed up the brexit process, my friend suggests.
" renegotiation has been fixed " and " britain has achieved nothing of value from renegotiation. "
europeans know on their skin how defending fleet street can be, and how sceptical the oligarchic media barons are who concern the eu with scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by tony benn, who ratified our 1973 entry into report 2: 1.
perhaps he remember vaguely of boris johnson, the euro opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was brussels' co-dent.
miliband knew enemies.
they have included the mixture of duty-payers, foreigners who used telephone fraud and pseudo non-domes who hold most important newspapers.
in fact, tony blair sees him exactly the same but he realised that when you are closed in a cbox alongside a nervous gorla, you must give him bananas in order to distract his attention from the thought of eating at noon and again to tea.
miliband was actually more blaired than blair in opposition to cameron's idea of a referendum, as blair made a concession on the principle of the principle of the abandoned eu constitution buried by french and dutch voters in 2005, which gave him an exit card.
the media did not forgive him for that either.
but jeremy corbyn, who reached my back friend on monday at westminster - i told him not to consume his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting murdoch strategy from ou to boycott neil kinnock of the 1980s, a then mistake now.
it may take time, but it must develop a coherent cooperation strategy with the media, not with me, but certainly with andrew marr whose position at the bbc left his vacation sunday.
corbyn's official position towards europe is what i would leniently call development.
he says he would like to remain a reformed eu.
most of those who disagree with the conservative' anglicism' could agree to that.
that is hilary said " a benn, but not a lnite " benn on radio and tv this week, when the researcher in him fought not to recognise that corbyn's appointment john mcdonnell as minister " in the shadow " on financial issues was a bad idea.
he reminded me of the 1970s when his father fought tv to be unfair to labour colleagues without going too far and losing his post in the cabinet.
hilary's fight has been more attractive.
but the fight to remain " in any situation " -- benn's expression -- does not correspond to what mcdonnell said, nor to what jc told colleagues and lawmakers at a private meeting monday night.
regardless of the image corbyn wants to convey - remember, he has also made me aware - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of television, and particularly in the varieties of social networks, a paranoia hotbed and treason.
it is right not to give cameron a' yes' ticket in europe, allowing him to take good support for labour workers in the referendum campaign, as mcdonnell said.
simon jenkins believes this.
but the basic stry of mcdonnell and corbyin about eu membership -- in line with their anti-capitalist past -- is no longer just a hesitant discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the narcisism of small differences is a central dogma.
as with his stry on nato -- tom watson is adamant that the jc will not campaign up -- foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
why should they waste paris or berlin political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions towards britain when everything could be pointless?
the us is already quite disappointed about the poor military performance of english in iraq, libya and syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as i was reminded of the launch of british influence security forum on monday.
specialists criticise england's public health department decision on electronic cigarettes
according to researchers, what a government agency said that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of whom with links to the tobacco industry.
specialists from the british medical journal magazine's editorial team (bmj) joined the lancet in criticising the evidence used by england's public health department (vet) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
he published the " reference " report last month and described it as a " complex analysis of evidence. "
however, several researchers have questioned data robustness and pointed the finger at links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
an article lancet medical magazine last month attacked the " extraordinarily fragile basis " it founded with the main conclusion.
two other researchers writing in bmj called into question their claims and base them " on solid land or on moving sand. "
martin mckee, european public health professor at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, and simon capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at liverpool university, said, " a fundamental public health principle is that policies must be based on effectiveness. "
they said they expect the allegations that " current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking' are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
in reality, only one meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a decision-making analysis model with multiple criteria (mcda) summarising their views on the negative effects associated with various products containing nicosia; the results of this meeting have been briefly presented in a research work.
mckee and capewell, said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called euroswiss health, whose executive director said to have received funding from british us tobacco in the past to conduct an independent study.
it also validated bat's public health accreditation in a sustainability report, he said.
they added that one of 12 participants in the meeting said funding received from an electronic cigarette producer, but not the funding there are reports would have received from the cigarette and tobacco manufacturing company, philip morris international.
the arguments on which members of the ship have not been selected, but among them include several " frkks " known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare financing the industry in work.
other meeting participants are not known for tobacco control expertise.
the head of the tobacco control section also attended the meeting.
the research work drafted by the group " convincingly musse " that there is a lack of " solid evidence of the detrimental effect that most products have according to most criteria, " mckee and capewell said.
however, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the report.
mckee and capewell said allegations that " so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers " are premature.
professor kevin fenton, director of the junior health department, says he has responded in the past to bmj claims.
he said " electronic cigarettes significantly less harmful than smoking "
one in two people who smoke all their lives lose their lives because of this vice.
all the evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic cigarettes for health is comparatively minor, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
it has a clear duty to inform the public of leaked information and those that do not come out of evidence, given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
annually, around 80,000 people lose their lives due to a smoking-related disease, and the annual costs incurred by the national smoking health system reach gbp 2 billion.
clearly expressing the current evidence - namely that although the use of electronic cigarettes is not risk-free, they only present a fraction from the detrimental effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national debt.

they played with achieving a more realistic advertisements, but " enriching it with strong animations and colours, it was more striking. "
" they did a great job helping us increase interest in selling illegal torture equipment within the fair, " says tom davies on behalf of amnesty.

violinist david grimal: during bach age there were no world tournaments.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people working, artists and not trade representatives.
french violist david grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as an initiator of a less ordinary project, downright' strange', as he himself says, les dissonances - international soloists and talented musicians, who interpret a symphony ire without being curious.
les dissonances was at the enescu festival with two performances this year: a performance in which solist was david grimal, founder of the orchestra, and one monday, when violcelist xavier phillips was the work made up by enescu being nelipsite.
both performances, held on the athens scene, showed the public another kind of performing classical music.
les dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at the time, the only classic musical whole in which there is no conductor.
conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
it is true, on the one hand, musicians need education either to become soloists or become interpreters in an orchestra - they speak of instrumolrather than composers.
they are trained as' specialised workers'.
they themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.
on the other hand of the scene, for the public, all music focuses on conductor.
and thus business, the music industry, makes marketing.
therefore, we are no longer talking about music.
so, if we look at this world, we have qualified workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and a public that cannot listen, but they has to look at, and it is stupid, " david grimal believes.
violinist tells that the change in the way music came from " musical deception " from his shock career.
i was like a high-level athlete to make the same exercise throughout the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and bring money and the music industry.
10 years ago, when i was around 30 years old, i found this very depressing, because we no longer found human creativity and fraternity in this system.
therefore, we have not found any more sense to continue along this path.
that is how i decided to create les dissonances.
this was in 2004, and at the time no one was doing so without a conductor:' the music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects'.
" how do you imagine marketing with a collective of musicians where there are no longer ego? " the artist asks.
david grimal acknowledges that les dissonaces is " a luxury, " pointing out that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
in 10 years of existence of ensemble, the lack of a conductor did not prove to be a hindrance in the music act: curiously the more we weigh a more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the work and not only in the role, " grimal says, adding that sunday's performance " we were 74 guidance on the stage. "
in grimal's view, the ennescu festival is a' very courageous' one, precisely because it also invited les dissonances:' an extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras in the world singsing and 3 times a day present, and in the middle of these orchestras you also invited this strange group'.
in a temple of orchestras tradition, such as the ennescu festival, there is the place and interest in something different, which breaks barriers.
speaking about enescu's work, the violinist acknowledges he feels romanian music of the famous romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when introducing enescu works on his repertoire.
grimal notes that enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is when we are talking about george enescu and romanian music, " because there is also a george enescu who did french music. "
grimal is advocating a change in how classical musical education is done, believing that the' the profession of musician, as being held today, has a death flflour' and that' the future of music is music itself'.
we do not need to tour the world 5 times a year if it serves nothing.
during bach's age there were no world tournaments.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were working people who were artists and not trade representatives.
for me, organising concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albums, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they serve music.
if not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
to illustrate this phenomenon, david grimal set an example to romanian products before and post to join the european union:' in romania, before entering the eu, you had good vegetables and meat'.
to enter the eu, you have had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
production and agriculture reach the service of supermarkets, as is the case in france.
with music, the same happens, it is the same logic.
les dissonances makes tomatoes not too fine, but when we cut them are true tomatoes.
in an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with education policy.
" if we considered -- as koreans, the chinese, the japanese -- that western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its learning into school, reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products, " grimal believes.
there are certainly things in classical musical education that remain very communist, which is everywhere, is something very militarised.
it is up to this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or whether we are forming a musician who will sing at an instrument and, above all, a musician.
we are talking about a completely different education if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) it needs to be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it is something else.
after your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or musician? " asks the french artist smiling.
grimal shows that for artists, the reward of another kind of music comes precisely from overcoming this status as " soldier, " overcoming what " they believe are their limits ": " musicians disdiscover at some point that they are not soldiers, and that is why smilators come out. "
david grimal spoke about his music project and his vision of music and the artist at the " festival of ideas, " a discussion with the public held at the george enescu international festival by the aspen romania institute.

cinema city seeks " small big voices "
cinema city launches the strongest challenge for children: doubling two superproduction figures " cracks " 3d snow. "
do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child, to whom you like films?
it gives him the opportunity to see.
in september, as part of the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, willing to reach future stars and between 8 to 16, cinema city is looking for " small big voices, " giving them an extraordinary opportunity to double two figures in a famous animation film.
if emphasis was placed in classical drawings on bringing the actor's voice closer to the character of animated character recently, those who are to interpret the voices are taken into account at the creation of stories, and they are usually well-known actors.
cinema city romania, however, wants to discover new voices, which is why we start an unprecedented campaign.
we want to find the right voice and we challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
they will have special experience, because the characters are sympatic and aftershocks are funny.
" children will enjoy and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors, " said ioana ionescu, marketing manager of cinema city romania.
in the first competition stage, from september 11th to september 30th, cinema city organises a shortpressure that left 10 children (five girls and five boys) elected who will have the opportunity to give a event in a record studio alongside professionals.
all parents have to do is access the lower platform of mari.cinema-city.ro, where to enter the child into the competition and prepare it for voice evidence.
they must then choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is to read and then the child will be interpreted by its own version of duplication.
four films about friendship, basm heroes, magic magic and hope can choose competitors to support the evidence: " pene galbene 3d, " " mune: guardian of 3d, " " blinky bill: koala cel poznas 3d " and " albinuta maya 3d. "
finally, the two most talented children (one girl and a boy) will see their full dream and double a superproduction figure in " the snow queen -- craks the 3d snow, " which will first premiere in romania this november.
fedex gains mixed, lower fiscal forecasts for 2016
fedex said disappointing results for the last quarter, with the supply giant reducing profit estimates for the whole year due to low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
the company also said it plans to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
during the same period last year, fedex announced that he would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
the company shares dropped by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of wednesday's opening bell.
fedex corp. said he expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next may with 20 cents less, according to an previous estimates.
analysts expected $10.84, according to a factset poll.
the falling estimate comes despite price hikes by 4.9 per cent on average, with the entry into force on 4 january and higher land transport overaxes of large or high-weight packages, which will be applied since november.
the company said it still expects increased gains from the previous year as a result of reduced costs, higher incomes and the development of online trade.
president and director general fred smith said " the firm faces a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially with regard to global production and trade. "
the holiday employment plans were announced a day after ups competitor said he plans to employ 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of employment he did last year.
in the quarter that ended on august 31st, fedex won $692m, 6% more than the previous year.
earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share by 12 analysts who responded to the zacks investment research poll.
profit increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
six analysts participating in the zacks estimau $12.23 billion.
fedex has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to stagnation in revenues from its express unit.
but the explosion in online shopping welcomed the results of the fedex ground division.
in the last quarter, revenues of the ground division increased by 29 per cent, but operational revenues have stalled practically due to higher costs for large packages and their own insurance.
the express unit registered an increase in revenues due to higher basic tariffs, while freight division revenues fell due to rising costs.
in pre-market trading about an hour before the opening sound, fedex dropped $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
on tuesday, closure dropped by 11 per cent year-on-year and 17 per cent compared to the record maximum on 11 june.
at the most expected meeting in recent years, policymakers within the federal reserve will spend two days this week around an honduras mahon table with 27 feet to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
above them, at an end of the central bank sessions, a diral painting of the united states will be summarise.
the map aims to recall that janet l. yellen, chairman of the edf, and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all.
the central bank has been given a dual task from congress: to maximise the employment rate in the us and to maintain price stability.
but since the great economic crisis, edf leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
and this third task could be factor x in too difficult to predict decision to be announced on tuesday and determine whether the us economy is ready to be unearthed by the unprecedented stimulus offered by the almost zero short-term interest rate in force since the end of 2008.
even though most data indicate a strong growing economy, the recent turmoil in the global financial markets could frighten edf officials already wary of adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even by a quarter of a percentage point.
" obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will be following, " said lindsey m. piegza, chief economist at brokeraj firm stifel nicolaus & co.
" but i think that if they sought an excuse not to increase the interest rate, growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait any longer, " she said.
there is no consensus on the decision the edf will make, which in itself causing instability in the financial market.
about half of the economists recently questioned by bloomberg predicted an interest rate increase this week.
but the financial markets expect the edf to postpone, with a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
this would indicate a drop on the stock exchange if the edf increases the interest rate unless policymakers alleviate the blow by promising to take a long time before the next growth.
on tuesday, dow jones industrial average moved up 28.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
the momentum was triggered by expectations that edf makers will maintain the stable interest rate this week, said john lonski, chief economist at moody's capital markets research group.
" it would be surprising for the edf to increase the interest rate at this point in time, " lonski said.
if edf decision makers were to do so,' they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets'.
other experts have said an interest rate increase would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the edf acts.
just a month ago, the edf seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the force of us recovery.
yellen said in spring and early summer that he expected an interest rate increase this year despite objections raised by liberals such as more economic progress is needed.
although job creation slowed in august, labour market growth this year.
unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the edf as full employment.
the salary gains have shown signs of growth.
and although inflation continued not to achieve the central bank's annual goal, edf decision makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of falling oil prices.
the economy " can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the labour market tension, " said ian shepherdson, chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics.
but the global financial markets began entering fibrilations later this month, after china devalued its currency.
dow jones industrial average fell by 16% below the record maximum reached in may, as investors feared that slowing down the chinese economy would bring down world growth.
the market's observed somewhat this month, with the dow index now about 10% below the may maximum.
for edf decision makers, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the time of interest rate increases.
" without what happened on the financial markets and news about weakening the chinese economy in recent weeks, would be more firm at the sitting, " said stephen d. oliner, an experience researcher at the ucla ziman center for real estate and a former edf official.
now he is expected to wait at least one month to deal with the effects better.
" there is a great deal of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the us economy and they almost do not have the data on which it will be based on events in china, " oliner said.
the well-being of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the edf, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision making.
in reality, however, the edf has become global monetary authority.
in recent years, the central bank's influence has been huge.
simply alluding by then president ben s. bernanke in 2013 that the edf could' narrow' its monetary expansion has triggered earthquake in global markets.
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly emanated, edf officials to be expected not only to monitor the progress made in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to better interpret the world economy.
his decision-making process is " more art than science, " said zachary karabell, head of the global strategy department at welfare management firm envestnet inc.
jeffrey lacker, president of richmond's federal reserve bank, va, said this month that " the edf has an oversized response record to changes in the financial market that appear unrelated to economic bases. "
lacker, a voting member of the state decision-making committee on open market, which supported the interest rate increase, offered the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
a financial crisis that has affected asia has led the edf to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, " despite implications with limited identification for us development, " lacker said.
a year later, edf officials returned to those falls.
the edf should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said adam s. posen, a former member of the bank of england's interest rate setting commission.
the last turbulent period falls far from that level, he said.
" we certainly do not want to end up in a position to fear an interest rate increase because the markets have angered, " said posen, president peterson institute for international economics.
the federal reserve act continues to hold a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, i do not think it should take prematurely action.

4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets in protesters in nepal
four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern nepal after police fired rubber bullets at crowds demonstrating against the country's proposed constitution, an official said on wednesday.
the violence occurred late tuesday in the rupandehi district, about 280km west of kathmandu's capital.
bishnu prasad dhakal, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station said, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
mr. dhakal said police forces used tear gas before shooting the air before turning to the use of rubber bullets.
twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
it was not clear immediately why rubber bullets, which are well known to kill, however, are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
the clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of nepal, where members of the madhesi ethnic group say new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
the protests also existed in the west of nepal, where the tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
at least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes on 10 august,
when four key political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces -- a major step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in nepal, centrally governed for hundreds of years.
the procedure for drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in april.
in kathmandu this week, lawmakers voted on clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted sunday.

burden reduction surgery could be useful for easy obesity diababetes
the benefits of burden-reducing weight for light obesity people with 2-type diabet could remain for at least five years, according to a new study.
it is still premature to say whether easy obesity diabeties live more after heavy surgical intervention than those following unhirurgical treatments.
" it takes a long time to centralise mortality data, " said dr robin blackstone, a specialist on obesity surgery, car wrote an article on the new study in jama surgery.
heavy loss operations named and suron the barrier, use various methods to reduce the dental.
they reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
over the years, barrier surgery has proved effective in the treatment of 2-type diabetet, but most studies were conducted on morbida obesity, with a 35 or higher corporate mass index (imc).
the imc, a weight unit in relation to it, is considered normal between 18.5 to 24.9.
the imc value of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and imc people over 30 are considered obese.
you can calculate your imc by accessing: 1.usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
for the new study, researchers at taiwan's min-sheng general hospital used the data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - bypass gastric and gastrectomie in manson - in the medical treatment of 2-type diabetet to light obesity people.
the imc mediu to people who suffered surgery intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year as part of the study.
meanwhile, the imc people who received unhirurgical treatments against sugar diabetet remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
of those who suffered surgery, sugar diabet sold completely to 36% and partly at 28%.
in the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, sugar diabet fully healed to only 1% and partly to only 2% of the subjects.
in addition, controlling horrific tension tension, triglicerides and lmr " bad " cholesterol were generally better in surgeical group, " the authors concluded.
researchers also monitored the sanguin level of hemoglobina a1c, which reflects the level of glicemia over time.
researchers write that the optimal level of a1c hemoglobis less than 7%.
after surgery intervention, the average level of hemoglobina a1c fell from around 9% to about 6%.
however, in the treaty group through medical methods, it has stood at around 8%.
but this improved " glicemic control " -- reflected in the a1c hemoglob's improved levels -- have not reduced the mortality rate to five years, according to chief researcher dr. chih-cheng hsu and colleagues.
the research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
in the fifth year, compared to the gasttomie group in manson, the bypass intervention group lost more weight (18.7 compared to 14.2 kg), recorded more considerable falls in the imc value (7.4 compared to 5.1) and hemogloba1c (3.1% from 2.1%) and presented a higher total% mission.
although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery five years later, there is evidence from a study by high-weight people in sweden that surgeical intervention extends life, says blackstone, of arizona university, the medicine faculty - phoenix university.
in the swedish study, obese people who suffered intervention by the barrier barrier presented a probability of around 29% lower to die after 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients who suffered surical intervention, blackstone said it was an optimistic issue for people with imc under 35 interested in the procedure.
" this is the point where this work is critical, because it says this surgeical intervention is safe in the lower imc group, " without increasing the risk of death or renal disease, she says.
blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start -- taking weight seriously then the patient's imc reaches 27-30.
" i think we are waiting for too long until we urge the people to take this seriously, " she said.
i believe that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have shortened their bodies by disposing them to obesity and diabet, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
" it is impossible for everyone to come to europe " -- the dalai lama - rt news
europe could not receive all refugees, the dalai lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis situation is in the middle east.
the tibetan buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the mother countries of refugees.
the dalai lama spoke about the problem of the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the dalai lama centre for compassion in oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to britain.
he said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even every continent.
he also stressed that while admirable, the response of western european countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
" it is impossible for everyone to come to europe, " he said in his speech.
although the dalai lama praised the efforts of germany and austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
" it is wonderful care for several thousand refugees, but we must, at the same time, think about long-term solutions to bring sincere peace and development, especially through education, to muslim countries, " he stressed.
after all, we need to think about ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
we need to reduce the use of the force.
force has never solved these problems, " he added.
on the issue of violence, the dalai lama also commented on george bush's actions following the 11 september terrorist attacks, saying that the violent response from the us caused a chain of uncontrollable events.
after the events of 11 september, i expressed my condolences in a letter to president bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
i know his reasons were strong but used force and generated unexpected consequences, " the dalai lama said.
a four-fold increase in children who have detered detergent hands over the past 4 years.
according to georgia's anti-otravire centre, us anti-poisvire centres have reported an increase of around 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have allowed up detergent hands with high alcohol content.
according to dr gaylord lopez, director of georgia's anti-otravire centre, the cases of deterggating detergents to children under the age of 12 reported at anti-otravire centres moved from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
" children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the chamber of emergency, " lopez told cnn.
lopez said some children intentionally drink detergents and others are doing so to impress their friends or respond to challenges on social networks.
films showing teenagers like detergent can be watched on youtube to create cheap beverages.
teenagers are said to have mixed up alcohol breath water detergents in order to get a louder drink.
smaller children can be drawn to the attractive smell of detergents.
" a child does not think he is harming them, " lopez says.
many of the most attractive types (of detergent hands) are the perfsmoed.
capwry gowry detergents, strugure, portocals are the most attractive to children.
hands detergcontains about 45-95% alcohol.
small children in particular, only a few freeze can cause alcohol poisoning.
" it is very focused alcohol, " dr stephen thornton, medical director of the anti-poisoning centre at the kansas university hospital, told kansas city's channel of fox 4.
thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people are leaving these detergents of hands into accessible places and if the small ones reach them, this is a rapid way of consuming a lot of alcohol.
a six-year-old nhaijah russell who recently died at school the equivalent of four sprays with detergent capwwning hands, has reached the emergency chamber to receive treatment.
it had ia179 alcohol, twice as high the threshold an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to dr chris ritchey, a doctor at the emergency chamber who treated it at the gwinnett medical centre outside atlanta.
nhaijah balmajea and cannot go when she arrived in the emergency chamber.
doctors monitored it overnight in a separate child hospital to identify signs of brain injuries, because the girl fell and hit the head due to alcohol, ritchey said.
" it was frightening, " ortoria scott, nhaijah's mother, told cnn.
it could have been fatal.
lopez urged parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or servservicemen and stop leaving their hands detergant to children.
besides alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
in 2013, two ontario women died after swallowed up detergent hands containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
health authorities assumed that the product contained metol, a lethal substance, not alcohol ethics, specified as an active ingredient.
in january, three fourth class students from northern new york plot to poisoning their professor " bad " by putting antibacterial products in class, " according to a police report.
a teacher is very runner to detergent hands and has banned him in his chamber.
police considered the plan to be " significant " and put forward the disciplinary problem for the school inspectorate.

because they are not rangers there.
here, there is not just talk of the return of those from rangers.
there is talk of old firm.
there is talk of both teams together and that is where interest is heading.
tension is high in matches in old firm and not just scots want to see these matches.
i will change the situation, it promises deila.
ronny deila accepted that celtic is struggling hard, but the norwegian chief pledged to change the situation.
the defeat with malmo and the subsequent elimination from the champions league were followed by defeat in the face of aberdeen who played in 10 people, who now top the ranking with a five-point lead.
but deila said " celtic had periods before and recover. "
we want to emerge from this situation as quickly as possible.
i know it is very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what is happening.
we feel the same - but we must go further.
we really need the support of celtic because that is how the players also become better.
it is extremely important that we remain united now.
warburton's caution regarding january transfers
despite comments just few weeks ago suggesting he had identified several objectives for transfers from january, the head of rangers, mark warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the unity of ibrox team.
former brentford chief said,' the january transfers period is very different from the summer'.
in the case of players transferred, there is the period before the season where they can be integrated, which you could see this season in our group.
the team is doing very well.
sometimes you do more harm if you bring non-needed players.
celtic targets michu
the swansea striker, michu, associated with celtic during the transfers, suggested he might withdraw when the contract with swans expired.

why execution in oklahoma
later today, apart from tardy legal intervention, i will look at how a man is sentenced to death.
if it happens, and i hope not happen, i will sit in a room for observers from oklahoma state prison execution hall and see how richard glossip is executed by managing lethal injection.
he asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
the invitation first came in january through his best friend, and although i was shocked, i accepted.
as the good day approaches, i am appalled my idea.
so why?
i agreed because i thought it a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
it would offer a one-off perspective.
it is true, journalists can witness executions in america and, because applications usually go beyond the number of seats available, a macabra lottery is taking place to decide who will be elected.
oklahoma reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
those elected will look at the execution with impartiality.
i cannot.
i would stay next to richard glossip's closest friends, in addition, i have developed my own link with him over months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two half hours.
i like.
we often laugh a great deal when we speak.
prison authorities say they cannot also witness a journalist, so i will not be allowed to have a carnetel and a pix to me to note what i see.
i will have to try to remember all the details.
oklahoma journalist accused twitter of compromising my impartiality.
that is the lesson.
it tells the story as he wants, it gains access.
i complained.
he has acknowledged that' it could have made better formula', but he still says i am wrong.
richard glossip disagreed with some of the things i have said and wrote.
it does not tell me what to write, and i would not do so even if it asked me.
i have told him that he can remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
but he wants an international report to write on the subject.
it believes that, if it dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
huffington post reporter kim bellware, will be with me.
if you want to find out more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that we have done.
i will not come back here to all the details.
i cannot say with certainty that richard glossip is innocent.
his actions after barry van treese's murder are him guilty of complicity.
but i think he is very likely not to be guilty of the murder.
i certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
i think his execution is wrong.
and i will look at it by dying from this perspective.
i cannot claim totally objective.
to do so, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
from me, you will find out how it is to watch a man he likes dying unnecessarily.
peter moody claims stewarans try to spy him, threatens to withdraw from races
peter moody said stewarans racing his victory tried to infiltrate a spy to his records last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from races.
he launched an attack against stewards and racing victoria's integrity department, saying they conduct a personal campaign against him, a drop that filled the glass being lady tatai's removal from the race due to treatment administered on race day.
moody told fair fax media that it has always tried to do the best for flights and is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome at lidari's cobalt test, for which it has no explanation.
for 18 months he swallowed up his words on statements on spies and did not want to resembthe' vulvulea that does not reach grapes'.
" i was not going to say anything about that and i kept silent a long time, but sometimes you reach such a high level of frustration that everything suddenly bursts up, " moody said.
it is a fact that it has continued.
sometimes you react and you have to suffer the consequences, and i will have to live with what i have said.
last night i will go home and sleep peacefully.
i want to go my head high and i want the owners i work with to see that i strive to give them all the best.
since they start to believe that this is not the case, i have to give up on the traring profession.
i will have to think at that point what i will do with my certification.
earlier, moody threw the bomb in an interview with racing.com saying the integrity department tried to spy on the records.
" eighteen months ago, terry bailey, dayle brown and dr brian stewart stood in a room with a man -- whose name asked -- and offered to commit him to my records to provide information about work there, " moody told racing.com.
i obviously consider me a trisor.
if so, then he should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
robert roulston, a former president of rvl, david moodie, current president of rvl and bernard saundry, current executive ceo of rvl, knew at the time and i know today.
should i think something personal?
is it necessary for the rvl to start spineless and hold people from outside traitors for what is happening in the industry?
do i have a bad influence on the industry?
so bad is my influence on industry?
perhaps that is how i see others.
perhaps it has to take my license and give me aside, and i have no doubt that the statements they are making now could lead them to think about this.
however, i have come to the point where i do not care before, and that is saddens me.
it dens me greatly.
i will put ep pressure and make a decision.
my family supports me and leave.
tra's frustration has increased with the long investigation into cobalt involving leaders, and the removal led him to say he could " put his license on the table. "
moody, whose name is most often associated with training the undefeated champion black caviar, labelled the race day treatment rule as " ridiculous ridiculous " after applying on the feet of a boboma with namol or argila, which violates the rules.
it violates the flights' rules.
i have to take my full responsibility for this, " he says.
one of my employees put namol on the leg.
it could have happened last night.
it could have happened yesterday, which happened.
it happened on the day of the race.
moody could be disqualified for three months for the race day of applying aplapplause, for which the stewarans opened an investigation.
a joke.
people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
" we all understand that rules are needed, but it went too far, " moody said.
driver who hit, fled cobram accident site arrested
police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclke produced in cobram at the weekend and followed by the accident site.
the cyclwas transported by helicopter to the royal melbourne hospital, seriously injured after hit by a car on the murray valley highway early saturday.
police representatives say the driver of the car did not stop helping injured bicclike.
on monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to police in shepparton.
he is said to be charged with fleeing from the site of the accident, failing to provide the first help and other road crimes.
the cycliist, a 40-year-old man, from cobram, remains admitted in stable.
coach melbourne storm craig bellamy responds to opponents in wrestling charges.
coach melbourne storm craig bellamy called criticism of the plates tactics his team team used as " distorted topics " raised by the two main favourites in the nrl.
sydney coach roosters trent robinson said the referees allowed players from storm to " take them trfoot " the team in a storm nervos match in the qualification final in sydney late friday.
brisbane broncos coach wayne bennett made a slight reference to storm after his team's victory in the north quensensland cowboys' qualification match late saturday, when he called the match a " demonstration " of the rugby league and said the two teams in queensland were not very good in wrestling.
bellamy jumped in defence of the plates tactics his team dealt with and said the players simply focused on " contact " when they liked.
bellamy says he gained confidence after two key coaches criticised his team, which means they were concerned that storm would defeat them.
" things do not stop there -- i did not hear trent robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2, " bellamy said on wednesday.
i can guarantee that we have not changed anything year in our defensive systems or techniques, as just as in the last six weeks, we have indeed emphasised contact in the plates and thus changed the situation.
trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a wonderful team, so it is probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
we know how always happens at this time of year.
bellamy contradicted bennett's idea of " animating football, " recalling bennett's st george-illawarra dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing " boring " football.
wayne talks about palpitant football.
he argued his opinion comparing his game late saturday with our game friday evening and talked about how palpitant the game was, " bellamy said.
i remember that in 2010, st george received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and wayne said he was neither interested in how black under the angle.
but now it has a team that can play what we would see as exciting football, especially because of quick young midfielder.
this game you want to make it when you have such players.
he brought that argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt their style of play -- not any team has two midfielder like anthony milford and ben hunt to be able to play so.
it gives me more confidence because they say this because they are somewhat concerned about the match with us.
six weeks ago, they probably did not think of us when they thought of important matches.
bellamy also pointed out that the match between storm and roosters was a bigger expanpt over the score compared to the match between broncos and cowboys.
the broncos match was probably a good match, have we not yet seen it how much was 16-12?
our match ended 20-18, were two more attempts in our game, does that mean exciting game?
or does it mean breaking breaks and not marking?
there are plans for me.
if i talk about us, it means that we could meet them at some point.
storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home either with north queensland cowboys or cronulla sharks in next saturday's preliminary campaign final in aami park, with tickets going for sale starting next morning.

prosecutor eilidh robertson told the danube court: " he said it is a dependence -- that he is dependent to frighten people.
he acknowledged that he made computer searches, but said he did so because he wanted to give himself as a policeman to frighten paedophiles.

hewlett-packard to make 30,000 layoffs
hewlett-packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs as part of the company's restructuring and cost reduction efforts in the services sector.
this year, which p will split on stock into two companies, separating the composition division and hampered from operations with corporate hardware and lightning services.
the expected layoffs will cost about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, hp said.
" these restructuring will bring the new hewlett packard enterprise enterprise a more competitive and sustainable structure in terms of costs, " said meg whitman, president and director-general of hp, who will lead unity after the rift.
" hewlett packard enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than the hp and will hold a broad business portfolio that will contribute to business transition to the new business lifestyle, " whitman said.

friendsfest: the comedy series that has taught us with important lessons about male friendship
the absence of similar figures in the series is obvious, as the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the past 15 years.
in 2013, suicide was the main cause of death at 20-45-old men in britain, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
in an attempt to address the problem, the campaign against unfortunate life (living miserably (calm) campaign has designated 2015 as the year of the man, seeking to question culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
friendship is at the heart of the fight for this challenge to succeed.
a recent study conducted on more than 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough many friends " with a healthy state of mood, " his chances for recovery doubles.
similarly, for people who are not suppressed, a circle of mental healthy friends halve the likelihood of mental disorders from emerging.
of course, in order for friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
in this era of the communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not on substance, the immediate character of the response often takes priority before meaningful contact.
our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong figure, open to fun and success, even though it is actually isolation that dominates.
this superficial success is dominated by what psychpsychologists call extrinsecist values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which even deeper affects our mental health.
the billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that the money really does not buy happiness.
the beauty of the friends series was that it has turned attention to the idea.
the characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, whom they showed by interacting as friends.
the mour of joey ey and chandler's frequent embrace when they look at football in the convenient seats and the passion of ross for rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate themselves with this situation, even though they often struggle to completely explore their feelings.
as a social worker explained to me:'... my role in listening to people with the suicide and suppressed trend has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference'.
often, the people who appeal to us do not feel able to speak to friends.
his old saying is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
friends is one of the series that come to mind when trying to provide more long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
the series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
however much it helps objective, outdoor intervention, via the phone people who ended up in times of desperation, long-term support comes from the family and close friends.
thus, if you attend friendweekend organised the central comedy this week with the complete drafting of shooting platforms to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to coffee in central perk.
or, even better, if you see someone alone in starbucks, smiled and to be welcomed.
it is never known what difference your friendship could make.
friends are broadcast on central comedy from beginning to end -- all 236 episodes -- in hook friendsfest.
di maria marks, helps the bsp to set malmo aside
angel di maria celebrates with blaise matuidi and edinson's cavani after marked against malmo.
angel di maria marked in her champions league debut match on tuesday and helped the bsp impose before sweden's malmo.
we still present your match chronic and your reaction to the game.
angel di maria and edinson cavani have done their job, paris saint-germain starting the champions league group match matches, with a reassuring 2-0 victory over malmo in a match at the des printi park on tuesday.
di maria marked less than four minutes after the start of her bsp champions league debut match, bringing france's champions to the advantage although they missed a number of opportunities before securing their advantage with the goal cavani has scored in the 61st minute.
reaching group a with real madrid and sahtior donetk, paris needed a strong start against the swedish champions because the french team's goal is not only to qualify for optimists but also an improvement in the journey to the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
but while they took the points, laurent blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with zlatan ibrahimovic who wasted the goal opportunity before replaced by the team in his hometown and the club to which his brilliant career began in 1999.
" it is not easy to win at home or travel to the champions league, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference from the next classes, even though there are still issues that we need to improve throughout the season, " blanc says.
it is a good sign of this.
we wanted to win and did so, although i am sorry we failed to give one or two goals.
ibrahimovic returned after injured one of three changes to the paris team, with a 2-2 stake home by borghex in league 1 at the weekend, but di maria took over the spotlight in the fourth minute.
when transferred from manchester united last month, argentine offensive midfielder was appointed man who will lead the bsp to the next level in europe and demonstrated this when tasin marco verratti's care behind malmo's defence before serving incredible over johan wiland, in the long corner on the right.
but if someone expected the bsp to win victory by mering from fingers, they were disappointed.
malmo, who defeated celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine holders in national teams, with a defence from five people and two defensive midfielder, was a strong adversary.
but their attack was not impressive, with the exception making the shot of nikola djurdjic who passed through kevin trapp's post in the 34th minute.
instead, the bsp players slowed down the pace several times, giving some unnecessary passes and not completing the interventions, even ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five attempts only in the first half and was then replaced by cavghts even after the game has resumed.
ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skill in supporting her colleagues, with his care that di maria sent to a shot diverted by wilacross the gate in the 52nd minute.
the second goal was finally scored after an hour of the match broke out of the match, thanks to cavani, uruguayan who scored the sixth goal in season after ibrahimovic pasched out of maxwell's belt.
that goal removed malmo hope that they would rebalance the score and only a superstop by wiland a distance for rejecting david luiz maintained the final score before the new meeting ezel lavezzi was cancel a goal in the extension.
the norwegian team coach in malmo, age hareid, later said the bsp was a fish class and that " the last match we played in the champions league in december last year. "
since then, we have only played in the swedish league, which is not the same level.
qualifications are not enough.
below the palace for the bsp.
they have made an excellent game.

" china must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving opening policies, " xi said at the 16th meeting of the central steering group for the continuation of general reforms (central leading group for deepening overall reform).

more than 100 stewardese fired for too fat
air india is firing about 130 stewarans and stewardese because they are overweight, the company announced late last week.
the state-owned company announced the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is " ridiculous " and " shockingly sexists, " the washington post writes.
mass dismissal is the latest in a ten-year battle between the company and more floer stewarts.
the weight limit for them dates back to the 1980s, when air india began using weight and ideal graphics.
in 2006, air india fired the new stewardese considered' exceptionally overweight', as this' can have an effect on reflexes and prevent the agility needed to take emergency measures'.
stewardesele sued the company, won and reengaged, but the company fired them again in 2009.

the source as saying that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and courses of action that reflect the policies established at european level adapted to national realities.
in view of the problems faced by the immediate neighbourhood of romania, measures are being considered for unified and coherent management of situations resulting from the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants into romania resulting from political, social, economic or military crisis situations.
" the romanian authorities will help create a flexible admission system but, at the same time, they will pay particular attention to citizens from states with potentially migratory potential or who can harm national safety, " the source mentioned adds.
the strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in syria, reactivating the conflict in iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the lying areas of romania (ukraine, transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the israeli-palestinian armed conflict armed intensity.
on the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic objectives on immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls on the legality of third-country nationals within romania and the proper application of remote measures and restrictive measures, the improvement of the national asylum system.

romania ranks third in the eu at an increase in labour costs

the only eu states where the normal labour cost fell in this year's second quarter were greece (minus 2.9%), cyprus (minus 1.2%) and italy (minus 0.4%).

tvr leadership activity report rejected in committees: stelian tanase risks dismissal
parliament's culture committees on wednesday rejected an activity report by the governing board of the romanian television company for 2014.
rejecting the report voted 17 lawmakers, one against rejection (senator varujan vosganian) and one abstained.
the report text will be submitted to the joint permanent offices.
they will probably decide next week.
the next joint house will be debated.
" i think that in view of this situation it will be done relatively quickly, " senat culture committee president georgica severin said.
he added that " it was of common sense " for the tvr leadership to also be present at this meeting, as no representative of the tvr leadership was present at the meeting of the culture committees.
it was common sense for the tvr leadership to be present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like this.
the invitation came to members like last night with an approximating hour that we did not know new hour either, but today, after the joint office meeting, i personally sent a fax to the helm of the tvr inviting it.
i believe that when you are convened, you are a budgetary employee, paid from public taxes and are convened to a joint committee meeting even though you do not like living alive.
" because it is your service obligation, you are in an institution under parliament, " severin severin after a meeting of parliament's joint culture committees.
he added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting based on the negative opinion of the budget committees.
debts also saw as they continued, came up with the idea that this year they would have been day, but they were not paid out of historical ones.
" i remind you that not from my fault or someone else in these committees that aggression was lost with the banks and the tax, there are clear management issues, " severin added.
he added that after the activity report is rejected by the joint plenary, elections will follow for a new board of directors, and it would elect the institution's director-general.
i do not know who will be proposed for this.
the wonders will not be done.
what is important is to make political decisions that this institution works.
i am not the man to lie you, to tell you that a genius will appear who queue here and beat.
i hope that those who decide parliament's plenary with their vote will choose the people who will lead the tvr.
there must be people who know what is happening there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
i do not know who will be, if you ask me what qualities they must have - i feel in their attitude towards employees because it is a maldar of petitions coming from employees, complaints, redundancies.
" when you get such complaints 50, 60, 70, something is ten and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster, " concluded the chairman of the senate's committee on culture.
while failing to appear in parliament, tvr chairman-in-general stelian tanase sent a letter to the speaker of chamber of deputies valeriu zgonea calling for parliament to consider a series of measures that could lead to rescue and guarantee the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexation of tv tax.
in the letter, stelian tanase requested, in addition to the indexation of tv tax, amending and complementing hg 978 / 2003 on the public television service tax, with a view to updating provisions at technological change level to day, as well as to regulating the control procedure in the payment of tv tax, and finding counteroffences and applying sanctions and penalties.
he also wants a provision to be issued to extend the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become srtv mandations for collecting tv tax by involving anre in regulating this activity.
in its opinion, it is necessary to set a maximum 5% ceiling on collection fees.
stelian tanase called for a reduction in the vat rate for activities specific to public television and contribution to the cnc from 15% to 3%, but also changes to law 41 / 1994, a view to the possibility of receiving budget allocations / financing to purchase licenses for major cultural and sports events -- the world football championship, the golden sky, eurovision.
he claims srtv will default in the coming months given that labour law obliges the employer to the implementation of court rulings, even if they are not final and wage rights are honoured as a priority to any other obligation.
the tvr administration has constantly made efforts to cut staff spending and tv production.
" this has reduced travel and other cost-generating activities, a number of trade contracts were renegotiated, and in late july tvr news was closed, " president tvr's letter said.
young people appreciate that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied through their own efforts alone.
" without the support of state institutions -- government, parliament, the presidency -- romanian television will, sooner or later, be unable to carry out its public mission, " the letter noted.
the chamber of deputies' leadership decided to send the letter to the committee of culture.

ponta, charged with uncontrolled slander, irrational claims
hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto has harshly condemned romanian prime minister victor ponta's words that political decision makers in hungary were " nothing better than those in syria, libya or other countries fleeing refugees. "
" yesterday, victor ponta lost his self-control and, with his irrational claims, offends the entire hungary, " the hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
civilised european politicians are not saying such uncontrolled slander.
" his remarks have only one explanation: he has completely lost his support in domestic politics in romania, " the head of hungarian diplomacy added, according to mti.
in a post on facebook late tuesday, prime minister victor ponta said he wants to draw attention and sanction the behaviour of senior hungarian government officials, who he believes " are a disgrace to the culture and values of the european union. "
i do not want to respond to challenges from hungarian government representatives.
" these are a disgrace to the culture and values of the eu; and in anti-semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis! " ponta said on facebook.
the romanian prime minister added that it is committed to sensible and sustainable solutions in the event of the refugee crisis, praising that aggressive brutalities and laws would not solve the problem.
barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in hungary, at the heart of europe, are political decision makers with nothing better than those in syria, libya or other countries from which those refugees flee!
" i believe in solidarity, in sensible and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of european values -- what we see in the last few days in hungary is completely at contradiction to precisely these goals and values! " the head of the romanian executive stressed.
earlier on tuesday, hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto described " mere lies " the remarks prime minister victor ponta's remarks on hungary's management of the refugee crisis, describing those claims as inappropriate for a leader in the 21st century, according to the mti.
the head of hungarian diplomacy also noted on tuesday that the romanian prime minister's " extremist and misleading remarks " relate to the internal political crisis in romania, and made it clear that budapest is apologising from the romanian side.
szijjarto referred to a statement by prime minister victor ponta monday.
what i have said and i always say is that i am against xenophobic speeches, the idea of closing borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are nonsense of the middle ages and i am totally opposed this approach.
if we can receive more, receive it, the problem is our logistics ability to treat those people as people, not as they treat our hungarian neighbours, knocking and series.
" that is what i disagree with, " the head of the romanian executive, said at a press conference in targu-jiu.
also on tuesday, peter szijjarto announced that budapest decided to start preparations on the ground to extend its fence on the border with serbia to its border with romania to deal with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
later, prime minister victor ponta said hungary's decision to raise a border fence does not solve anything from the refugee problem and " pull hungary out of europe. "
what link between osama bin laden and collapse of mecca cranes
saudi authorities announced that audit giant binladin group belonging to osama bin laden's family is " partly responsible " for the collapse of a cron the great mecca mosque on friday, which left 107 people dead.
according to an investigative committee, the company has not " complied with with the safety rules, " the saudi news agency (spa) reported, the bbc reported.
company directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation is completed into the case.
the firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
the construction firm is owned by the family of former al-qaeda terrorist network leader osama bin laden.
the company was founded by osama bin laden's father 80 years ago and is currently led by former terrorist leader bakr's brother.
binladen group has been working on 4 years on expanding large mosques for 4 years so that we can host several pilgrims.
the accident occurred during a storm late friday, when a slaughter, probably unbalanced by the strong wind shelves, collapsed on the eastern part of the roof of the big mosque in mecca.
as a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 injured.
how the haggades closed their mouth of challenges
widely seen as romania's largest football player in history, gica hagi was labelled, after withdrawing from his work, as a weak coach, who cannot be able to perform performances in the new position as well.
after unfortunate experiences with the national team, her star galatasaray, hagi assumed the coaching role in the constant future, his team, a year ago.
a year after assuming the team, the king showed that he was capable of turning a team struggling to save from downgrading to a top one.
thus, a year later, the future was, with 16 victories, 11 misams and 11 defeats, recorded, with hagi coach.
the balance sheet is one of a top team struggling on european cups.
things took an even better turn for the future this season, as the team finished second in league 1, with 19 points, one less than astra leader giurgiu.
the future also has the best league 1 attack, with 20 goals (by astra), more than double than star.
on the other hand, even though he brought several experienced players, hagi has continued the policy of promoting young people, and recently names such as ianis hagi or hodorogea appeared on the start team.
club policy made the future team to pursue for teams abroad, so the hagi sold 1.5m euros this summer -- ianis hagi (fiorentina - 1,1m euros) and alexandru mitrita (bari - 500 thousand euros).
along with the star, the future is the only profitable team in league 1, according to data from the trade register.
in the refugee crisis, romania has so far played as a small country.
it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
large countries come up with solutions for the entire eu, says cristian ghinea, a member of the managing college of the romanian european policy centre.
in an interview with ziare.com, cristian ghinea showed that europe cannot be transformed into a fortress and purely police means will not work in this crisis: " maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with. "
but there are masses that have started and we cannot return history.
migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as well as possible and adapt them to us.
in cristian ghinea's view, we are at an extremely emotional time, where politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
once it passes, europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules within the schengen area must be changed:' schengen is now like an animal created in another age and which was not adapted to the situation now'.
where are we in the refugee crisis after this jha council, which has actually solved nothing?
it is clear that ec president in agreement with donald tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
all the forecasts said that they would have had the necessary votes.
before the treaty of lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in the jha and any state could block any decision.
that is why things have been very little integrated into the area of justice and home affairs.
after lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the ec has the initiative, and the council also approves it with the vote of 55% of states, that is, 16, which accounts for 65% of the eu population.
the calculations were saying that the votes existed.
but they did not want to move forward.
as this is a sensitive issue, rejection reactions have arisen in germany itself against chancellor merkel's opening policy and did not want to appear in many countries such as an' eu response sends us migrants per head'.
they have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because this wave obviously creates a huge problem for schengen governance and we will probably see great changes there in the coming period.
so mandatory quotas were not really eliminated, but was the subject only left silent?
yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement by frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are on the external border of schengen to the responsibility of community agencies.
greece's border with turkey is also germany's de facto border with turkey and this wave of migrants has set the limits of the old schengen system.
perhaps the dublin principle will be waiup that migrants are the responsibility of the state in which they enter the first time, because it is unsustainable.
if greece places, you cannot say indefinitely that it is greece's job.
the problem is common.
precisely because the problem is common, is a resolution possible without a precise, perhaps even binding, mechanism for sharing the reception effort?
nobody knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work if they are reached.
because a problem remains: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to romania or portugal, but to sweden or germany?
i do not believe that european states will go to take migrants up: you go to country x or country y.
some single filtering centres will probably be reached, in greece or turkey, where asylum applications can be processed.
work is being done on solutions such as this.
but the problem does not have a simple resolution.
there are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without any experience, like romania, where the problem of migrants will increase xenophobic.
the fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in turkey, lebanon, in jordan, who are sitting in precarious camps and who have just begun to go for europe.
an estimate says only 10% went to leave, winter is hard to cross the mediterranean, but we expect an perhaps even larger wave next year.
what are we doing with their people?
my sentence is that we will get used to this problem, we will no longer look it so catastrophic from a media point of view.
you were talking about countries with less or greater experience.
does it seem to you that there is any place where it really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-european culture?
i look at the maghreb in france, turks in germany, they are also enclaves.
i would not go radical statements.
of course, their integration is more difficult than with other waves of migration, but this does not mean that it does not integrate at all.
it remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in france, germany, in the united kingdom.
but purely police means will not work.
let us create fortress europe is illusory.
it must be blamed on the mechanisms for integration into european societies.
there were some mistakes here.
we must be more demanding.
let us ask these people to learn the language, try to take over values, stop remaining on one foot in europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family, including through marriages of convenience.
however, the impending issue of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
if others have failed in long-term integration does not mean that we must look at them how inherent in the mediterranean.
perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
and if there is an intervention in syria, which i do not think, does not mean that the country will recover overnight and take them back.
solutions emerge, we see fortress within europe.
borders have been closed, walls, border controls are reintroduced into the schengen area.
is the european project in jeopardy?
the european project as such, the schengen area as it was built, yes.
it was built quite minimal and arranging the rules, so pressure was too high on countries where they put these migrants for the first time.
that is to say, we are moving freely and there, but everyone is with its problems.
this cannot be the case in the face of such a wave, because some countries are not coping with.
when there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show they are doing something, but much is changing in the long term.
after the attacks in france do not have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the eu than we had last year.
it is a wave of public emotion installed in both senses.
and it is so unstable from one week to another that you cannot make decisions on the basis of it.
we have a lot of talking, many rebellion statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virmoral.
and then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in turkey and public opinion is emotional.
once public emotion has passed, we will return to the reasons why we have created this area, this freedom of movement, which is not only for people, but also for goods.
this is the real european market.
and i do not believe that europeans will give up this principle of libertatations of movement.
that there will be other rules is something else.
schengen is now like an animal created in another age and was not adapted to the current situation.
romania how has this crisis played so far?
as a small country, which believes that, if it sog on the eye and places its ears, the theme is disappearing.
faced with the reality of waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it is not your small-country problem.
that is what we have done, it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
you are not, do not play at high country level.
large countries come up with solutions for the whole of the eu, good or bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
as poland.
on the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that romanians' appetite for schengen will fall greatly.
president iohannis says it is perhaps good that we have not already entered.
so we are moving from the disperair of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
there is, of course, a risk if romania and bulgaria enter schengen that migrants see us as an alternative route.
this does not mean that it is a reason not to enter schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
romania will be part of schengen, and schengen will exist, but turned into the sense in which external borders will become shared responsibility, will be single rules for accepting migrants, single rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
the ukrainian president said that after russia moved its attention to syria to ukraine no one died.
is there a link between the two phobreaks, a russian game?
russia behaves frustrated power.
she believes being great power means incurring the americans and europeans.
from this point of view, yes, there is a link.
without the regime's military and financial effort, the assad regime would probably have collapsed.
and it was good to collapse before his main opponent was islamic.
any two years has been a fight between the assad regime and moderate secular and muslim militias, supported by the gulf and western countries.
then the islamic state grew up and now we no longer know whether we want the assad regime to fall.
russia was able to complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
it creates breaks of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
but you are only great power if you also have solutions.
off-side game is just a strategy for time.
putin probably expects bids to be made, to press butons to resolve the situation.
offers do not come because the world is not convinced that it can resolve in one way or another the issues it has also created.
but i do not agree with theories who say that these people are driven by an invisible hand.
let us not see a little stronger than it is.
ec buton to appear soon
millions of facebook users have become used to the " like " button, and now social networking network representatives are preparing another opposite, the " dislike. "
on tuesday, mark zuckerberg, a co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on his account that button would be available soon, the new york times reported on blog.
zuckerberg made it clear that the " dislike " button would show a nuance of what a user feels rather than just an option.
however, his announcement raised the issue that facebook could become a less friendly place.
zuckerberg noted he wants to avoid when someone posts on his account an important life event and someone else will give " dislike. "
network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long been asked to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
mark zuckerberg also said it is not very comfortable for people to give' like' to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of a death of a family member.
" you may not feel comfortable to like that post, " the facebook representative noted.
a new facebook button option has not been well received by everyone.
" there is already enough hatred on facebook and social networking networks, " atiq haneef in afghanistan commented on the new york times facebook page, where the article on the subject was posted.
" i will give' dislike' dislike' button, " he added.
roger anderson, a microbiologist from atlanta, claimed that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on facebook.
debra aho williamson, social media analyst at emarketer, noted it is hard to imagine that a single button can send a complex range of negative emotions.
moreover, she says, the election campaign in america is approaching, and the " dislike " button would create a total disaster.
only 70 refugees enter hungary 24 hours
hungary accepted only 70 migrants on tuesday, a hand of thousands who came en masse to its southern border with serbia, government adviser gyorgy bakondi announced.
hungary declared a state of emergency later in the day in two counties along the border with serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing and announcing that it would build a border fence with romania, the dpa recalls.
the move drew sharp reaction from serbia.
just yesterday, they said that they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to apply for asylum.
" as you see, this is totally different, " serbian minister for refugees aleksandar vulin said.
before imposing new immigration legislation, a record 5,809 migrants entered hungary on sunday, police announced on monday.
more than 170,000 immigrants from the middle east and africa also entered serbia in 2015.
many avoid being registered and try to reach the west, especially in germany.
the " new " county council headquarters is typical of it.
two insolvency
the massive investments made here in recent years to move the institution, are to move down because they have been stopped several times.
two important builders who worked here entered insolvency during the work.
county council headquarters vasile alecsandri will end up alone.
a year and a half after the consolidation and functional work of the building should have been completed, work has not reached half.
a final stage in the era of the building was consumed recently, when the national dispute resolution council (cnsc) rejected a complaint by the firm that wanted to take over a contract to draft the technical project for the work still to be carried out.
the initial project was drawn up by impex romcatel sa.
after the builder's insolvency and interruption of work, negotiating procedures are under way without publishing an announcement of participation with imperomromcatel, expected to update the technical project and then a new tender for works will be held.
" but the negotiations did not finalised with a contract, with the cj praising that the proposed form would have put the institution at a disadvantage, " said razvan timofciuc, who represented public relations within the cj.
the cj decision to break direct negotiations was attacked in court by impex romcatel.
the emerging tribunal sent its complaint to the cnsc, which rejected it as a belar.
however, this does not mean that the ecj can start seeking another design.
impex romcatel has the opportunity to attack the cnsc's decision at the appeals court, only after its final ruling could consider finding another project.
thus, work to strengthen the building could resume at the earliest next year.
our intention is to restart work as soon as possible.
in principle, restoring the technical project should not take a long time, but we must come to concluding a contract.
" we are waiting to see whether or not the cnsc decision will be attacked, " timofciuc said.
consolidation work by the former headquarters of the police questors began in 2011.
a first works contract was terminated in april 2012, after 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
the tender is resumed, with the contract going to moldovans.
the firm entered insolvency, however, and the contract terminated after 1.5 million lei were paid.
about 50% have been carried out so far.
initially, consolidation work, refunctionalisation and mansaration of the building had been evaluated at 7.7 million lei.
" no, i say! " -- the statement that could criminalise the former cadastre head
one of the employees involved in the scandalous file at the cadastre office signed an agreement to recognise the facts against delayed prison.
his statements will most likely criminalise other indictees, led by former head narciza nedelcu
an adviser to the cadastre office and real estate advertising (ocpi) iasi accused by the dna in a corruption dossier has recognised its fap.
an agreement on recognition of the facts signed by dumitru dascalu was registered yesterday at the iasi court, with judges setting to give a solution in the case on 29 september.
dumitru daniel dascalu was accused of forforgery in the continued form and agreed to execute two years in chichişinău with delay, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
as for dascalu's imten facts, prosecutors made it clear that he, as an adviser to the cadastre office, along with other colleagues, " drew up several minutes of accepting in falsely, the prpri wanted real service contracts in the previously cheid by o.c.p..iasi with business managers sc gauss srl, the five srs group, srs s and the s sand jlambrak
recently, former office head narciza nedelcu, but other former or current cpi employees have been tried on the dossier, with charges being filed to the firms mentioned, although work has not been done.
the judiciary's pre exceeds 300,000 lei.
stone adventures
in the opinion of president frh alexandru dedu, romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and preparing women's handball team to qualify for the olympic games costs an fortune.
romanian handball federation president alexandru dedu said at a press meeting yesterday that it is great pride that our country has three teams in champions league groups.
as for romania's national women's handball team, " the main goal is to qualify for the rio olympics, but for this it needs to go through two stages of caudine furfts, primarily the world championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament, " dedu also said.
we very much want to qualify for the olympic games.
these are tomas ryde's technical relay fantastic requirements.
the staf that will include seven or eight people.
he wants second coach, medic, two masses, portals coach, physical prepare ator, head of delegation.
they have asked us to qualify some things, namely materials for physical training, which i have never heard.
that all to reach olympic olympic games; and i will do everything to have them.
we are talking about a massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
but that is the way forward.
because we are currently in the stone age with the preparation.
" the teams with which we are fighting have these materials and have had them for some time, " said dedu, who noted he was trying to obtain the amounts needed to purchase these products from mts and cosr.
president frh also referred to romanian infrastructure and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
we do not have the chamber in bucharest.
it is an infrastructure problem and it is shameful to call a european gymnastics championship into question.
let us not forget that olympic neighbourhoods have been built in other parts of the world of the world within two years.
before 1992, in the current barcelona olympic area, it was a landfill and has now reached a milestone of beauty.
the same in london, where the organisation of the 2012 olympics was also a success in investment.
" in my view, in 2024, we can host a major competition, " the du added.
he added that international handball bodies are willing to give romania major competition.
it is a priority for me to bring major handball competitions to romania.
mr gatu went civilised with a project, people gave their consent in principle, but they made it clear very quickly that the chamber would never be built.
i, too, had talks with ehf, i told them that we want, that we were able to organise and said that they agree and invite them at the first match in the new hall in bucharest and then we are discussing concretely.
" so we have all openness, and ehf and ihf, but we don't have infrastructure, " the frh official explained.
the former great handball player avoided assessing the chances of the women's csm teams and hcm baia mare of finally reaching four: " i called on all coaches to be reserved in pronostiks, that if they do not return against them. "

14 million lions given to iasi's st. spiridon " hospital in rectifying the budget
what will be purchased with this important amount of money?
" st. spiridon " hospital received from the health ministry following about 14 million lei.
the money the medical unit received to use by the end of the year will be invested in modernisation and planning work for clinics, but also in the medical and technical machinery for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograf computer with a new radiology apparatus with six trks used for surgical interventions, six properly equipped beds, oftalmogic microscope and other appliances needed to conduct the medical act.

hamas, laughed by ratp controllers and a horent.
tourist bed
a cluj tourist family came to iasi to visit him, but the trip ended bitter promise.
after experienced experience, too, my wife never want to calmer in your city any again.
without wishing to they have met with ererroneous information, not feeling rapt controllers and bonus bonus, a fine' such as the law'.
spouses arrived in iasi several days ago, fell in a hotel in the centre and called for tourist leaflets.
they also received a dreadful where ratp routes were passed.
" armed " with these maps, the husbands have visited hamas.
but two days ago copou, they wanted to reach palas mall.
because there was no ticket ticket at station near copou park, they were based on pliep print information: that they can take ticket through sms.
nobody told them that this service no longer exists.
confident confident, they climbed into a bus and tried to send sms after instructions from the pliers.
unfortunately for them, a team of ratp controllers has emerged.
they said there was no longer the 2-year service and it was announced in the press that it had been cancelled.
where do i know what was written in the local media, coming a evening before visiting the city?
i spoke to controllers, i explained their situation, said they did not care, that is not their job.
the attitude has been very defiant.
they said all they can do is anger us one fine instead of 2 (thousand and wife).
" i paid, i did not want to shout my day to visit standing at the gendarmerie and making statements there! " ovidiu diu counts.
in conclusion, the family was amended because of ererroneous information from the leapliers and controllers who " applied the blood law. "
that is not right, and i made a complaint to ratp iasi to recover my money.
this is not about money, there is not over-many, but the idea is that i felt deceived.
ghinion for ship rape.
accident, under preventive arrest
the trial of the seven rapists in vaslui has moved to the iasi appeals court since yesterday.
emerging magistrates tried the first trial at a non-public meeting in which the seven young people accused of cking an 18-year-old woman called for freedom.
before the trial session began, one of the outstanding judges assigned the file, viorel munteteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues in court.
the magistrate activated until the summer of this year at the vaspe tribunal, where he served as the president of the nale section, who, on april 9th, acknowledged a challenge filed by four of the indictees, placing them under house arrest.
currently, the dossier is being tried by a complete that includes mythical ical mititelu and getless.
earlier, in the dossier, he formulated a abstention and judge dan an ton, on the grounds that his daughter was in a relationship with competition with one of the rapists' lawyers.
the two judges decided that the rapists in vaslui should still remain under preventive arrest.
ti sisters will remain imprisoned for at least another 30 days, when juccors rediscuss the possibility of putting them freely.
the trial of the trial term will take place at the appeals court of iasi on 6 october.
before reaching the iasi of appeals court, the duba with which ship rapists from vasship was involved in an accident in the neighbourhood neighbourhood, with the car entering iasi to the belt.
autoutilitara iveco, with which the seven rapists were transported hit a volks wagen car exiting from stradela performs, and the driver tried to come to the left.
duba circulates from the end of pacs.
the car entered iasi here because prison administration employees preferred the route from vaslui to iasi to walls, then on the bypass road.
they have thus shortened the road by a few kilometres.
immediately after the impact, the arrested escort called for another transport to take over detainees.
shortly, a car was sent at the site of the accident from the iasi safety penitentiary, who took over the seven detainees and transported them to the appeals court.
following the accident, none arrested were injured.
to transfer them to the other duba, guards surrounded the back part of masi, and arrests took to speed, two each.
" the incident was not reported to the police, because drivers of the do ua vehicles understood amicably about the damage to be paid, " said chief commissioner madalin taranu of the ipj.
migration
romania is neither nor will be ready for what to come.
but
i say it from the outset clearly and clear: the 7000 refugees romania should and must naturalise are, in itself, an insignificant but huge number compared to the ability of the romanian state to manage such a project.
for romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by bucharest, amounting to around 1500 soul, far exceeds us the good intentions of solidarity with the european union expressed in recent months.
certainly, if those migrants really accept to be set out in our locations, the chances of integrating them quickly into romanian society are extraordinarily small.
i am convinced they will be the first to lose patience.
paralysed by mobsters and paralysed by an venal political class, the romanian state proves mired in all areas.
the helplessness to integrate the gypsies is just a trivial example.
in addition, governments of any colour were not able to absorb european funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, to ensure decent healthcare, raise misery on the street, create honourable paid jobs or to keep their own young generation at home.
why would refugees be established in another country from which they run?
but what produces a great deal of wonder is particularly the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt with.
we first come at the rebellion fatarism of the strong states of the eu, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
then it comes the cold hypocrisy of romanians who, although they have millions of cattered relatives around the world, do not yet accept the other - on the other language, another blood.
perhaps for fear of not stealing his national being.
after all, there is also hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invokes the horrors of war as a reason for departure, do not accept any other destination for exodus than germany or northern countries.
not all refugees are syrian, however, and there is there is no war in pakistan.
also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is being analysed can only be confused.
the causes must be eliminated, some argue and, by squerbling strictly on the book of political correctness, they are calling for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
but there is peace in romania and even enters, from time to time, some foreign capital into the national economy -- but this does not prevent tens of thousands of romanians from leaving their country every year.
why leave?
in this crisis, the european union has been revealed to us that smooth, torn and outdated construction by the situation.
we deplore the fact that romania was unable to invent a country project, but here the eu does not have any future plan either.
and improvisation and threats do not help anything.
what is the eu still using, then, if the only advantage romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be called into question because of waves of refugees crossing borders as through cheese?
at one point, the war in syria will end.
not the crisis of migrants, however.
in the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc., will push millions of desperate migrants, from asia, and particularly from africa, towards a better life.
with such politicians, romania is not, nor will it ever be ready for what to come.

two fratiers in tomesti have allowed somspheres.
hospital taken
two 9-year-old children, or 11 years from tomesti, brothers, have swallowed up several diazepam pills.
they found house pastilleries and took them out of curiosity.
their mother followed treatment and medicines were not hidden.
the children were urgently taken to iasi's " holy maria " hospital.
they are in stable, as doctors say.
exclusively: a wholeheartedly breaking meeting.
20 years he received a courageous gift: biological parents
lost in hospital under unclear conditions, in the denial of the 1990s, when it had only two months of life, small, ssaill and helpless, and then adopted by an wealthy family in italy, in the same years when adoption was vague vague, a young woman was now taking a blonda and beautiful girl, met the day before yesterday in iasi with the parents of a biological village.
crina will last 20 years these days, and its palermo adoptive parents thought to give their daughter loved a stunning and courageous gift: a visit to romania, to iasi, to know their unclear past.
" the newspaper de iasi, " which assisted home family search efforts after several highly vague indices, witnessed these meetings that basically break your heart.
according to reporters, emotions at the moment, statements by those involved, their reactions are downright moving and overwhelming.
the drc's story story starts 20 years ago in the rusty y locality, while it was only two months.
then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to hospital in the city.
at home, there began misunderstandings between parents, and the mother had to go on the home.
he decided to keep up and for me to send me from home.
he stopped the girl, and i have known nothing since then.
" when i learned that he was in hospital, it was too late, " alina alina, a biological mother of the girl, remembers.
crina was admitted together with her grandmother to pascani city hospital, and then the girl's father costica balcan left for work in the town of alexandria, teleorman county.
their lives had to split definitively.
they no longer find crina at hospital
after the interior, the drc's father left for work in another village, and returned six months later.
meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in iasi, and the father, when he returned, no longer found her.
i think it was almost nine months since the girl was in hospital.
" he thought she was abandoned, " tells a family granddaughter.
due to financial problems, the bunica was unable to come with crina to iasi, and the girl remained in doctors' care.
because no one was more interested in the fate of the child all the time, she was taken over by the directorate-general for social assistance and protection of the iasi child, who then gave her to care for the foster centre in bucium.
there were years in which the abandonment and adoption were more ily regulated than today in romania.
at the bucium centre it was found by italy's salvadore and his wife, a palermo couple who wanted to have their child but fell short.
they fell in love with the blonduta crina and had permanently move with them to italy after some time later.
it had already done nearly two years as adoption formalities lasted.
when we saw crina, we felt it was before us.
" as if my wife gave his life, " he tells us smiling salvadore, the adoptive father, while catching in firava's palm of the girl.
in the country, drc's parents, alina and costica, continued the search separately, each where they could.
the father asked the rusty authorities, but did not receive any answer where his child could be.
police then told them they may be dead, but in iasi parents found out what really happened to them.
when i sought it here, they told me to the court that he was left for italy, to palermo.
and conditions look for it had no longer.
we asked god to be good.
i thought about it in all the years that have passed, but there were no possibilities to blame, to find it.
" it is hard, " ttfully tells us in the drc's biological mother in the eye.
but even though the years have passed, rusty parents were not forgotten.
in italy, salvadore and wife explained to the girl coming from and that her past links it with romania.
i was small when i found out.
i think i was five or six years old.
i reacted as a copy, i was curious.
" i wanted to know my parents in romania, " i confess delighted.
and her dream was to become a reality.
in march of this year, chief commissioner romica ichim, director of the regional centre for prevention, evaluation and anti-drug advice iasi, was contacted by an italian knowledge, who explained salvadore's desire to find the drc's biological family.
and the search started only from a name.
after our request from our partners in italy, we began the first steps.
we received only one name, coastal balcan, then rugsty.
shortly i had a job with the city hall there, and i could ask whether there was the name received name.
then they gave me some indications, only that the person found was not that sought.
" it ultimately lasted about a month to find the biological father of the girl's face, " chief commissioner romica ichim explains.
in all, more than three months took authorities to find coastal coastal and alina, especially as everyone was living in another village.
we began work somewhere in march, and in june-july we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
" then we established that a first meeting would take place in september, " romica ichim added.
at his weekend, alina and costica first saw their lost at the holdings of the iasi hospital 20 years ago.
the father, moved, could barely master tears and his hands had died forever.
it is barely changing a few words to those around.
a week before the meeting could not even sleep.
it was emotional, passing.
" to see your child after so many years, it is something, " tells us an granddaughter, who also comes her coastal of rugsty.
drc meeting with mother, biological brother
in talks with him, who is expected to study at a well-ranked university in italy, costica balcan told him, among other things, that if he once wants to return to him, the village, he will quietly: he can give him some sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and incite a household.
my mother is also emotional, complains, and hardly believes this can happen.
i am emotional.
i did not believe that this could happen.
i saw this on television, i thought in these years, i hoped, but i did not think that could be the case.
these are very great emotions.
if it could forforgive me.
i hope that we will visit ourselves in the future.
" i hope we can keep in a connection, " obraji alina, the drc's mother, tells great tears while a servicel in his hands.
he also conceals his tears, fortunately, because he will shortly see with them after so amar of time.
on the other hand, crina, which will implin just a few days' time, 20 month, is trying to reassure himself like an emotional child.
he does not know what to expect, but outlined a vague idea of her biological parents.
he think they are young people, but now before the meeting is trying to give his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
my parents are two mothers and two fathers.
but it is my parents at the end of those who have increased me.
it will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
" i hope to have a beautiful memory with them, because now there is so much to say, " crina confess.
first family meeting
in the unification market, under the skies begun in the autumn, the rusty family again unites their destiny to them in palermo.
the crina is 20 years ago, ends the high school, according to the italian school model, but can begin a new chapter with alina and costica, its biological parents.
they no longer divide borders or countries, but only a barrier: that of language.
more than which, with the help of an translator, an italian local owner at the centre of mine, easily passed.
those who managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of its kind, and that in future, if the opportunity still arises, they will do so.
it is the first event of its kind organised, by such an emotional load, and i am pleased to be a success.
we at the centre have various activities, and we are often associated as an institution dealing only with consumer consumers, drug addicts.
but we are trying to restore something good back.
" had i had asked for such a food, i will do so with great dear, " says by smiling romica ichim, director of the regional centre for prevention, evaluation and drug advice iasi.
behind it, the balcan family, with crina in the middle, is telling themselves.
i am understandable: they have a lot to say to each other.
truce weapons on the leg yesterday in the psd.
everyone draws their soul
camps in the extraordinary branch of the psd wrapped up a gun truce on the leg.
after successive rounds of talks, held from friday to sunday, the first to be the most tense, psd leaders have agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
pressed by party executive president liviu dragnea to present a united position, the emerging social democrats will send him with a whole list of potential candidates for party posts.
far from over, the internal war in the party seems to have taken only a break to allow combatants to shoot their soul.
dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
it has launched a very simple and very current message under now on: try to find a solution not to jeopardise the party.
on 3 october we have party elections.
all functions will be made available to those who want them.
" until then, we remain in the existing structure, " acting mayor mihai chirica.
the two days of talks at the weekend led only to the conclusion that nothing certain was set.
fierce competition is expected in the october elections as president of the psd's county branch.
on the short list of possible candidates for the main post in the party's subsidiary includes state secretary maricel popa, senator florin constantinescu, senator sorin lazar, county adviser vasile catea and interim county council acting president victorel lupu.
also added to this could como schitu lead mayor mihai mihalache.
one option under consideration is the candidacy of psd county advisers leader cristian stanciu, should lupu no longer join the race, with party sources saying he is not interested in office.
the only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of former branch leader, mayor gheorghe nichita.
the list of candidates is open.
under status, applications can be submitted on election day, and would not surprise anyone if it happened.
" what is important is that we remain united, and we will remain after october 3rd, when we have a new executive office, a new permanent county office and all new leadership structures, " catea added.
until internal elections are held, the leadership of the psd county branch will be secured by victorel lupu, a close to nichita and stanciu.
lupu, however, is on leave until 29 september, with preparing the elections practically to be secured by the branch executive secretary, county adviser mihail popescu, in cold relations with the nichita camp.
contacted by phone cristian stanciu praised the talks in recent days as leading to " a partial consensus. "
there is a broad willingness to maintain the balance and unity in the party.
a partial consensus has been reached to support a unified team to deal with the county.
" but on the other hand, there are several variants regarding intentions related to the candidacy for the psd iasi presidency, with the list remaining open, " stanciu commented.
emerging judge refused vaspe rap' file on grounds of competition
the seven young people in convicted vaslui county for rape today arrive at the iasi iasi appeals court.
vasluians sentenced to sentences between five years to eight months and eight years, and four months will today present their arguments about putting them at large, after the underlying court, vassa's judgment, set their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was handed.
the file was recorded at the appeals court late last week, with judge dan anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
anton cited the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer bogdan luca, is his daughter's competition, lawyer dana anton.
luca defends silviu ovidiu burada, who received the highest sentence in this dossier.
motivated judges ruling
late last week, the magistrate from ship court who sentenced the seven young people motivated the ruling.
motivating the judge talks about the defiant reaction of defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
" the court notes that after judicial control is placed under preventive terms, the restrictive measure of freedom but not deprived of freedom, under the impact of the attitude of defendants, their families and local supporters, has been felt at local and national community level, a strong sense of indignation that people accused of serious facts are being tried to a less restrictive extent, " the motivation for vasship judgment said.
magistrates also dismantled the main defence of the seven indictees who during the trial that the girl they raped would not be " " door of church. "
" the court plays that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, which the defendants wanted to highlight through the apparatus they have formulated, as a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext, " the motivation also reads.
corbyn, brexit and european future
for economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades cannot continue the same in the coming years.
until saturday a little world knew in romania who jeremy corbyn is.
even today, after he became the new leader of the uk labour party, many wonder to what extent the election of a politician can affect us who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
jeremy corbyn is the most radical post-war labour labour leader.
marxist said, anti-monarchist (once urged tony blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family of buckingam palace), an anti-american feroce and an sympathiser of vladimir putin (was otherwise regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel " russia today "), and terrorist movements hizbollah and hamas to abandon.
for corbyn, who considered at the time the killing of osama bin laden a real tragedy, isis is almost preferable to the united states.
along the model of all populist demagogues, corbyn, of course, has miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
things of the kind he said and promised and tsipras in greece until he chded with the real world and economic legties.
the economic programme of the new labour leader provides, among other things, for massive renationalisation and the printing of money as a solution for financing projects to develop and cover very generous social benefits.
of course, some might ask why the money printing solution is not unanimously adopted around the globe, we would then have global general prosperity! but who would prevent themselves from such details.
of course, we can charge bankers to blood, become some kind of service enemies of the left, but as far it has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or ecuador or venezuela, but also in france, at the beginning of mitterand and hollande's mandates.
the additional sums are quickly swallowed up by generous, short promises made by populist demagogugues.
as margaret thatcher was well attracted, " the problem of socialism is that others' money ends at some point. "
few give jeremy corbyn a real chance of ever reaching prime minister.
in the early 1980s, another radical left-wing leader, michael foot, who was not as highly believe anyway as the fresh party leader, failed lamentably in the elections.
and then there is still a workers' class in britain in the classic sense of the word relatively consistent and structured.
and trade unions were sensitive more influential than now.
with the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant throughout the labour force, and extensive automations have made massive need for highly qualified labour in in industry, corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
but even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
in his last number of financial times believe corbyn's election increases the chances of brexit, namely britain's exit from the eu.
the new labour leader has been a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the union.
in the eyes of the radical left, brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed austerity on the poor.
when you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that is rocking the foundations of the eu are reaching an explosive mix.
and not just britain.
but if the british decide following the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the union the loss of symbolic capital for the entire european project and the deep lines created within it by the euro crisis, and now that of refugees, between north and south, between east and west, leave room for scenarios in the most worrying ones.
all the more so because for a whole series of member states, london was an account to the franco-german axis (in which berlin increasingly becomes the dominant actor).
true, the british business, the city city, are strong lawyers for the country's stay in the eu.
but today's europe is no longer in the past.
there are many resentment, which are increasing in intensity as early as these weeks.
the problem is that brussels, we had a stra right recently in jean clude junker's speech, increasingly tends to take major decisions over the head of the vast majority of member states consulting only a few european powers, mainly with germany.
and this is as electoral support for the antisystem, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time as eurosceptic is growing dramatically throughout the continent.
in other words, the negative emotional climate has reached higher than ever in the past.
hence, the conclusion that the financial times draws from when assessing the breit chances.
the pro-eu option is based on a cold calculation leaving national interest.
if voters make cerebral decision, then britain will remain in the eu.
but corbyn's victory reminds us of emotion in current politics.
eastern europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
especially if, as expected, we see greater integration of the euro area, which will push most countries in the region and on the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in europe.
corbyn, tsipras and syriza in greece, the podemos in spain, even bernie sanders in the united states are fuelling its populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in inter-negotiable societies.
for economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades, generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the coming years.
under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the euro area - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that have only taken into integrationpolitical ambitions, not the capacity and availability of the peoples and governments of europe to respond to such challenges, turbulence on the continent, internal tensions in the eu will rise in intensity and major affect romania's situation.
and it is hard to rule out something in terms of possible scenarios.
the question is whether our main political leaders are facing such complicated situations.
constantin brancusi, god taran.
rockefeller: " how can i help you? "
brancusi:' take the workshop!'
the great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, get famous, hear about him around the world.
behind his reputation, however, there is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for life success.
that also has a name.
it is called' truda'.
what constantin brancusi?
what remains to be said, in fact?
his figure appeared on banknotes.
and recently, a well-known bank in romania has hired an actor to play it at a advertising client.
cheese produce and deliver money nearly 60 years after it is no longer among us.
in romania, there are hundreds of streets and boevards bearing his name.
in fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
and when it emerges odrasla, you hear the following instructions:' we are going to the park, brancusi'.
the country is immune by its statue.
there are few romanian personalities whose work will be known so many world, from children, to the elderly.
brancusi's infiltration capacity is huge.
the communists, too, failed to extirpe from romania's memory and culture.
his quotations fly the internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of like and share shares.
and, then, what would still be to say, to be written about this man?
viewed from the lot of books and articles trying to reconstitute its destiny, brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
you know, there are those people who tell you that, if you did not have the luck to give birth in any large city and in a family as well as possible, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
and perhaps it would be a key here.
perhaps the forthcoming text should start here.
with a sentence, however detestable they are.
forget successful creative stories, which are delivered daily to newspapers and television.
look carefully at this man's figure.
do you want to know how he has succeeded in life, how, today, he heard a whole of the world?
simple.
he has worked to be someone.
that is what he did.
constantin brancusi born on 19 february 1876 in hobita, a small village common to fish, gorj county, at carpathians.
he is the fifth child of maria and radu nicolae brancusi.
although he came from a well tareasant family, cheese and leading a modest life, but one of which he had to reap the benchmarks that will guide his late artistic vision.
recalling childhood and places where he increased, the artist would confess at a meeting with petre tutea in 1933:' then life was beautiful and harmonious'.
by millennia, people happily took a patriarchal life.
everything quiet from one seasons to another.
and do you know why things have changed?
great city's civilisation reached us.
brancusi's childhood, however, was far from idyl.
one of the times spent in these first years of life is highly revealing for the combination of purity and violence that characterised his future sculptor the years spent in their home village.
the timing is re-produced in the work " cheese, " a biography " written by alexandru buican.
in 1879, constantin brancusi was 3.
in the autumn of that year, when tuica was made " at a barracks, " watching those who sample the liquidid to see if the process is carried out properly, cheese and catch a time of general attention.
it fills its record with tuica and drink on brepressed.
it falls into almost instantaneously.
the first people see only a few minutes later.
the mother panic, then hysteria, believing his son died.
in the evening, when the father radu radu, returns from living accompanied by greutari, he sees away the desperate signs of those who progerly await him at his mouth.
the party is immediately turning into jale.
the father is already considering burying the patient.
however, someone finds it is good to call on baba brandusa, doftoea and cheese cheese servant.
cheese check the child's breath, then put them under the preajma horse nas.
the strong child.
the world applauds.
while the boy is left to sleep his beer forward, joy joy, spending with laurels continues with even more force.
the next day, father and son meet through livada.
radu brancusi puts constantin to gather nuts and bring them.
the father takes his child his head down and, with the boy's bloodshed, he beats him in mind.
and while feeling the ustinging of the blows, small cheese has the revelation that the world can also be regarded from another perspective and that the surrounding things can come around.
especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, leads him to ask himself, as he had to recognise in old age, if not the astritself participates in his unrest.
was the sun as disturbed as his father of what had happened?
currently, city is not working
an mp calls on politicians to remember those who voted.
independent member viorel blajut called on the psd and the pnl to stop internal battles and reorient their agenda to the electorate.
what we are now seeing on our political scene is a great divide and so.
we have not seen anything of the usl projects in 2012 that will continue.
neither the highway nor regional emergency hospital see only how politicians dispute their possible sites according to real estate interests.
let us leave a little political aside, let us gather and speak.
at present, the city is not working.
" if you are busy domestic war, you have time for those who elected you, " blajut said.
he assessed the current political class disappointed disappointed emerging voters, with a very low presence in the upcoming local elections, around 30 per cent, effectively representing the parties' fitrue electorate.
the member also believes voters will also move to traditional parties, voicing reservations for new political initiatives, such as the " for iasi " party that will be launched today.
local parties have a very little chance and will only break from the electorate of the right, not that of the psd.
such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually on the right.
" the right is worse, which is not good for anyone, nor for the psd, " blajut said.
he made it clear that he is not interested in an candidacy for the upcoming local elections, denying rumours of his intention to join the mayoral race.
i also said that i do not want to run any local office.
i am also thinking whether to continue as a member and in the future term of office as well.
i tried to call for unity for iasi and in the holding discussions, with the other parliamentarians, and i have been accused of wanting to give my image.
i do not want, but we cannot go on like that.
" if people voted for us, it doesn not mean they are stupid to vote for us if they see nothing, " said blajut, who assessed the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is their hypocrisy.
a tatarasi colleague said he did not get his money and must go by bus.
let us not be hypocritical.
there is little money.
sometimes i am ashamed to raise the money from the cam.
at the end of my term of office, i will make a report with everything i have spent, apart from cabinet employees' salaries and its maintenance.
i happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lions, with all transport accounts, accommodation and others.
" to tell an mp that he does not end up his money is clean hypocrisy, " he ended blajut.
