8 poll figures show donald trump has a real chance
some have tried to label him as a ffflower " politician.
others called him joke.
and others wait for implosion.
but regardless of the way some republican ans are trying to remove donald trump from the poll of polls, has not worked (yet).
ten of the past 11 national polls have shown donald trump leads two of two figures, and some are beginning to seriously wondering what this means for the chances of appointing the real estate mogul.
of course, it is still premature.
none of this says the trump will win the race for the nomination of the republics.
pundits shows that during the same period of 2011, rick perry advance made place for herman cain in the polls, but none won in any state in the nomination race.
and the reasons why they would fight hard in the general elections are numerous.
but outside groups such as jeb bush's super cap and and conservative conservative group club for growth acknowledge trumtrump's power and start to support it with money.
we continue present present you some figures from recent polls that suggest that real estate mogulis not just a passing ent:
the figures indicating support for trumtrumhave returned to 180 degrees.
even before donald trump announced his candidacy, in mid-june, a poll by the university of monmouth shows that only two of 10 republican ans had a positive opinion of real estate mogul.
by mid-july, the percentage rate climbed to 40%.
in early august, it was 52%.
currently, six out of 10 republics have a favourable opinion of donald trump.
about three out of 10 say they have negatively negative.
these figures remain.
a poll conducted last week by quinnipiac in iowa concluded that 60% of regional republican republics have a favourable opinion of trump.
two-thirds of gop voters would be happy if the trump won the race for the nomination.
in a poll conducted last week by cnn / orc, 67% of the republics said they would be " enthusiastic " or " satisfied " if the trump won the race for the nomination.
only two out of 10 say they would " upset " if the trump won race race for nomination.
only ben carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm that trump (43% say he would be " enthusiastic " towards 40% who say the same thing about trump).
the closest in terms of enthusiasm?
marco rubio, by just mere 21%.
on the other side, 47% of republican voters say they would be " dissatisfied " or " upset " if favourite favourite b bush wins the race for the nomination.
most republican ans do not view trump's temperature a problem.
although donald trump has been strongly criticised for insulinsults and bombastic style, 52% of republican voters at the national level believe the real estate mogulhas the the right ament to be president, according to a poll by abc news / washington post.
we find the same figures in the iowa state where also 52% of the republics believe the trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to the survey that was conducted last week by quinnipiac.
however, 44% believe that it does not have the personality personality to act effectively and almost six out of 10 independents say his temperature does not have any seek at the white house, according to abc / post.
republican voters are getting used to the idea.
when they take the attitude of intellectuals, republican voters consider the trumtrumis genuine.
according to a poll last week by cnn / orc, the question of who is most likely of winning the race to nominate gop, four out of 10 said the trump.
the situation changed from the end of july, when four out of 10 were bet on jeb bush.
full information: in the past, the gop voters have not read the future very well.
during the same period of the last elections, four of 10 republics elected rick perry in the race for nominnomination than only 28% for mitt romney.
however, these figures show that most of gop voters consider trump's campaign plausible.
even if the republican or reted to another candidate. the trump still heads top all.
some say the divided situation is likely to contribute to trump's victory, while supporting trump will split to more than twelve candidates.
but a poll in early september by the university of monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of collaboration between trump and the majority of the other republican candidates, almost always the trump will benefit from majority support.
trump stands from 13 points from carly fiorina at 14 points of marco rubio, at 15 points walker, at 19 points of jeb bush and finally, 33 points each in a row paul, john kasich and chris christie.
it is almost equal with ted cross ted.
is the only candidate to beat him?
ben carson would beat the businessman 19 points in a hypothetical one one-one confrontation.
most of donald trump's supporters say they been decided.
a new poll on tuesday by cbs / nyt shows that more than half of voters supporting trump says they does not change their voting option.
obviously, much can happen in this regard and no one can say they will never change mind.
46% say they leaves the open open to the possibility to change its option.
however, trump's most important adversary sary currently currently neurosurgeon ben carson, but it is twice that voters who say they have decided to vote with trump.
six out of 10 republics say they agree with trump on the immigration issue.
since donald trump has named immigrants from mexico " violists " in his opening speech of his campaign, two months ago, immigration was the central in the campaign for 2016.
some are concerned that trump's bombastic style lead to a split between key hispanic voters and the republican party and will harm rebranding efforts.
but, according to the poll conducted by abc / post, six of 10 republican republics say they agree with trump on the immigration issue.
so, it seems that as long as the immigration problem remains in the spotlight, it will also remain doland trump.
frustration with the authorities is reaching new colods.
donald trump and ben carson are now being supported by nearly half of the republican voters, largely due their status status outdissidents.
according to the poll conducted by abc / post, six out of 10 republics say they prefer a political outder to the expense of someone with experience in government.
people angry upset washington.
a poll conducted two weeks ago in iowa by des moines register / bloomberg shows that three of four republican republics of iowa are frustrated by the performance of the congress republican congress, 54 54% declared " dissatisfied " 21% " nervonervoand culme. "

around twelve ministers from the fanhost ma cabinet refused to be part of mr corbyn leading team, arguing by differences of opinion on the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a parliamentary party parliament supported him as a leader.
bbc political correspondent robin brant says the differences in politics " cumulate " in the labour party after corcorbyn appointment on his position towards the eu and the benefits limit.
mr corbyn said at the tuc conference that the labour party will make changes that will completely eliminate the idea of limitation.

the labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas' from foreign sources' for questions to mr cameron and that he has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
mp islington north said that pmqs involves a level of too-confrontation and and will refrain from replicshocks and attacks, committing instead to focus instead on serious issues such as the poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.

thanasi kokkinakis supported by tennis australia president steve healy
thanasi kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticised for his behaviour.
thanasi kokkinakis was the collateral victim in the " storm " created around his friend nick kyrgios, and his behaviour deserves rather words isispraise and does not criticise, in opinion of president tennis australia, steve healy.
kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duoften called " special ks, " was unplantly gged in light of the spotlight by the scandalous outrageous derapage kyrgios to stan wawrinka at the montreal masters tournament.
in a qualification ancff match he played shortly after, five year, the chair referee had to intervene twice. " in order to separate kokkinakis and his adveradverryan harrison, after which the harrison said: " wawrinka should have put to to earth mr kyrgios.
although he was last seen by making a powst rocket after crampe musculare and and missed a possible us open, angangor richard gasquet, kokkinakis was firmly defended by healy.
the teener is currently in glasgow, where he vies with sam groth for second individual place after bernard tomic in the davis cup semifinal against england.
" one thing i feel strong is that in my opinion, thanasi has been attracted a bit into conflict, " said healy.
the truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost for accusing crpe in us, but it is not the first player to break a rocket out frustration frustration him himself and i know thanasi well enough enough to know he would not proud of that.
but let us be serious, it has been extremely well managed in rather provocative situations in us with harrison and so on and i think it deserves a lot of trust.
it has an extraordinary team, has has a great family, and i think it has been unfairly treated.
he is a 19-year very matman, is working hard and integrated into the team, he had no conflict with other players, he is very respected in the western west, he is hard, it is in excellent form, is a very balanced and mature young man, and mature ur, and i think that is is worth be tried exclusively on the basis of his qualities and defects.
healy also supported the decision not to take heed kyrkyrgios for his important rent match, which begins on friday, and described the " joint decision " as the most suitable for all, but but advocated the return of the original canberra long-term term to the team.
" first, we want for the team to focus fully entirely on the back game and not to think at all about the controversy around kyrgios], " healy said.
and i think nick has moved very quickly, as people such as federer murray ray, he matures under the public's eyes and made terrible mistakes and and deserves worth criticised, but we try trying to support, help him to understand the consequences of his facts of his facts and i think he needs a time when he is not at the attention to he to reflect both for the team.
elections 2016: hillary clinton's good advantage to bernie sanders narrorank to half in the national polls.
former secretary of state hillary clinton still has a two-figure advantage in the democratic for national candidacy, but senator bernie sanders wins ground.
clinton is now backed by 47% of the democratic voters (down from 58%), while sanders is second with 27% (in up up from 17%).
vice-president joe biden, who has not yet announced whether he run for president, is backed by 15% of the democratic voters.
at least five months before the start of primary primary elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say they were decided on the candidate they will support.
but clinton's supporters are stronger in their choice than supporters of other candidates.
compared to the poll by cbs news last month, clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while sanders won a few per cent.
clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has narroreduced.
support among men has fallen considerably, and sanders is a distance from just 5 points.
clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 evaporated, now at equality with sanders.
however, clinton still still the advantage among elderly voters.
last month, clinton is outside sanders, with two-figures, among the liberals, but sanders now has slightly-point advantage in this group.
about half of democratic democratic voters nationwide cally say they would astically support clinton if elected to run on behalf of the party.
a quarter would support it somewhat reserved reserved and an additional 15% would support it only because it represents the party.
six per cent would not support it.
perhaps unsingable, the likelihood of clinton's current supporters will be exenthusiastic about her election is high.
opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support clinton - only about a quarter quarter would enthusically support her.
while 48% of the democratic voters say they would enthusically support clinton, the number of republican voters who say the same about the first, donald trump (35 per cent) is lower.
when clinton's supporters are asked with an open question about why she would like her to win the race, the majority response that she has adequate experience (16%), followed by the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is is the best candidate for this office (10%).
clinton's supporters also mention her association with bill clinton (9%).
the agreement is also mentioned on these aspects and eligibility.
as the vice-president is considering a possible candidacy for presidency, 57% of democratic voters want to see see in the race - although one third third i do believe that they should not run.
on the question of second option for the party's representative, democratic voters are majority call biden.
of clinton's supporters, more than half say biden would be the second option, well before sanders.
if biden decides not to run in the democratic party democratic race, hillary clinton advantage advantage sanders grows, from 20 points with biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of democratic voters view clinton the with the best chance of winning the general elections; but the figures dropped from 78% they were last month.
biden is second, however, the most eligible eligible has increased.
however, when asked are asked what is most important important for an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
like last month, no democratic or possible candidate candidate is considered by these voters as unacceptable as a party's representative in the presidential race.
democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well as regards few key characteristics towards the primary voters of their party.
most of voters view clinton, sanders and biden as being integrated and trust and with solid qualities of leaders.
biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity while clinton clinton strong is is leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not believe that h. clinton is integrate and confidence, twice than those who say this about sanders (15 per)), but 27% do not think it about this.
democratic voters also generally believe the three, clinton, sanders and biden biden, have the same ideologies as they.
on all these issues, about a quarter of the democratic voters not have an opinion of sanders.
how the questions persist about the use of a personal email address and server by hillary clinton when she was secretary of state, most of the democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation on the subject, and say he did not affect their general opinion on the candidate.
however, is is the case among the us public.
half of the americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only nearly one-third are satisfied.
public opinion was divided in march on this subject issue, shortly after the issue came revealed.
most american majority say the controversy over ememail did not affect their opinion on clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion negative negatively.
mainly the republicans more than six out of 10, say they changed their opinion about clinton in the negative sense.
although democratic voters believe clinton integrate integrate of confidence, this continues to raise her problems among at general level: only 32% see it integrate confidence and confidence, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in may.
62 per cent of voters do not see it integrate and trust.
at the same time, 55% of voters at national level do consider the trump integrate and worthy of confidence.
however, both clinton and trump have white bles for leadership.
of the six reviewed candidates, biden, carson and bush rank the top terms of integrity.
the number of those who consider sanders integrer is higher than those who do not agree but as in the case of carson, many have no think about him.
the margin of error for the 351 primary democratic voters sample is 6 percentage points.
five members of the brother charged for murder of student last 1 at the baruch faculty
nearly two years after a faculty student has lost his life during a ritual ation ritual in the pocono mountains in pennsylvania, five people were accused the murder.
members of the frtherhood pi delta psi at baruch faculty in new york brutattacked chun " michael " deng g during a ritual of initiption in september 2013 and postponed it to take it to hospital, which contributed to his death, according police police.
official sources say the victim was related to the eye, a backbehind behind 14kg kg csac full full the sand, and has repeatedly repeatedly bullied while trying tried to move towards a target on frozen frozen land.
l. deng accused headheadache and he lost his knowledge.
members of the frpi delta psi did not sound the the emergency after he fainted and claim to have waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.
but they found the time needed to change deng's clothes, look for symptoms symptoms google and contact andy meng, the president of the national-level frtherhood, to ask his advice, police chris wagner said at a press conference.
" at this moment, members have started hiding their personal goods and practically put the good of the frtherhood ahead of the good of michael deng, " wagner said.
he could not be resuscitated and died the day day morning.
according to an autopopreport, the deng suffered repeated traummas, trunchi and coapse.
" too many families were devastated by the frr' ritues, 1970 at least one student lost his life every year of the ritues, " douglas fierberg, lawyer deng's family, said in a statement.
the brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
the grand jury of the monroe district recommended that the first five members be charged with three-degree crime.
thirty-two meries of the brotherhood, including mr meng, will also be charged for the ultraj and complicity in the murder.
" we want to hold accountable not only the people involved but if there is an organisation that has authorised frtherhood, official or informofficially, we will also hold it accountable to account, " wagner said at a press conference on tuesday.
the baruch faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew affiliation with the local representative.
that will happen when the federal reserve rate interest rate increases.
the interest rate will increase and the bull market (growing market) will be bled, bond bond profitability will increase and the economy will enter into recession.
that is we know.
what we do not know is as long long it will happen and how it will take.
in the economy, history offers little signs of time.
after the first increase of the interest rate, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
the aggressiveness of the federal reserve to increase interest rates is often often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets are responded.
that is why officials from the us central bank stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start to increase interest rate but on the path of the time needed for normalisation.
indeed, multiple variables are at stake.
but, finally, the market players could see that all the stir about the interest rate increase has been exaggerated.
" the first interest rate increase decided by the edf after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the " cheap money, " said julian jessop, a chief economist at capital economics, said on a note to to customers.
on the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of us interest rates to more normal levels but still low to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid.
but it cannot say that there will be no effects.
we continue to presenting how how several sectors of the economy could react react, building on historical trends:
given the situation that the market has been faced with in recent months, anticipating growth in the interest rate can volatile things for a time.
but, at the time rising, the impact is not so dramatic.
" it seems there is a tendency for the profitability of capital to stagnfor 12-24 months after first increase, which may perhaps again reflect the defin in monetary policy, " deutsche bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the edf increases.
specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has increased - by around 14% - moving towards increasing interest rate, quite invariable over the period of 250 days after (average average of 2.6%) after returning returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on the n by the chief veen strategy.
deutsche said the impact on actions is tend to become pronounced pronounced later in the interest rate cycle and benefits are starting to decline.
the recession is a reality of economic life, but the the interest rate often contributes to it.
in the current situation, the edf is facing conditions that have not been existed before and which could speed up a recession.
more specifically, gross domestic product will be closer to its historic minimum point for an edf edf interest rate increase.
according to deutsche bank, out of the 118 interest rate rate rates after 1950, only twice-nominal gdp was less than 4.5%.
even in the second quarter of 2015 2015 value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to edf atlanta.
increasing the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question " whether this this time is different, " deutsche said.
market players have prepared ready this year for an growth decision from the edf edf, with all eyes are at this week's meeting of the open market commission that ending thursday.
although many strategists and economists believe that the mc could approve an increase in interest interest rate at this meeting, mid-term transactions indicate only 25%.
" in our study conducted after 1950, all the interest rate growth cycles up to have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with gdp oversoversliping vareaks ahead to the recession very quickly after recovery, " the report said.
on the contrary, this has been a strange zarslow slow recovery after the worst recession in the period under examination.
the current cycle is by far the longest expected by the edf since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it has reached 74 months and continues.
fixed fixed income also also volatile as the market expects an interest rate increase, and the printing is somewhat similar to dividends.
the main difference is that the impact is more quickly for bonds than in case of actions when the edf changes politics.
in the case of bonds, it seems the benefits change changing direction once the first growth / decrease in the cycle.
at the end of the cycle of increasing interest interest rate, profitability on bonds is falling immediately, " deutsche said.
charles schwab strategies of the opinion that these interest rate increases will result to the profitability closer between short-term term and long-term bonds, applauising curb.
high-cost bonds are doing better in such an environment, although " we are still wcautious ary of forcing profitability, " said kkathy jones,, a fixed income analyst analyst in schwab.
interestingly, jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of the edf policy.
" apart addition to power strength of the dollar and falling inflation inflation, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy, " jones wrote.
short-term interest rates have increased, pace of profitability is fairer, the average credit interest rate spread spread has expanded and volatility has increased - all the market characteristics when the edf tighpolitical politics.
in,, companies-majority activity in the us will benefit from an increased interest rate and local products will become more attractive.
the high indebted multinationals will suffer, because the increase of the dollar will lead to their products more expensive in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
" history shows that' quality' stocks have a tendency to be more profitable in the three months after an initial increase in the interest rate, " analyst goldman sachs said in a report to customers.
strong balance balance firms have exceeded those with a poor balance after each of the interest interest in 1994, 1999 and 2004 with an average of 5 percentage points.
companies with high proceeds from capital and low low volatility stocks also exceeded companies similar to a lower quality, with an average of 4 percentage points) 3 (percentage points) respectively.
the debt will become an important issue.
companies with a large percentage of flodebt have the most to lose, goldman says.
consumers will also benefit from the the dollar's increase.
those who save could also gain won, although experts do not agree how quickly this will happen.

the sad memory kept by the holy place, where only a few days ago, a construction bloodshed collapsed through tavmosque's mosque, falling on believers.
the bodies were released for funeral funeral after saudi's king penalised the construction group of the bin laden family for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.

the victims included the father of four children, qasim akram, from bolton, great manchester, in his first pilgrige ge when crcrcollapsed.

saudi authorities have already promised that hajj's pilgriinage in mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still reaching the city.
today, king salman said that the binladin group should not have the brarm of high macchery when the bloodshed was not in operation.
an arab version of the decree, published by the saudi news agency, said the binladin group bears partly blame for the collapse.
the news agency's english service did not present that detail, but said the company leaders had received a ban from leaving the country.
earlier this week, salman jurw to reveal what caused the collapse of the crcral in the grand mosque court, where hundreds of thousands of muslims came before hajhajj pelgrigrilater this month.
the binladin group has not yet made statements about the collapse of crcral and the group's representatives could not contacted for statements.

for several decades, the binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of saudi arabia and is conducting major construction projects.
the latest qaida leader, osama bin laden, was a " renegate, " disinherited by the family in the 1990s.
the collapse took place in strong wind conditions and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions people in the royal to participate in pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the lives every muslim physically right.

other injured will receive half of that amount.
the advantages and disadvantages of credit conversion into swiss francs
on the banking market, already been two offers to converinto credit lf in swiss francs, the main advantages being being exclusion exclude currency risk and reduce the rates.
disadvantages can come in a few of time, when variable interest can lead to an increase in rates.
the transylvania bank has just completed the process of conversion credits into francs granted by volksbank, and the banpost announced the conversion offer for its own clients.
according to cumulative data by analysts from the finfinzoom, the post offers three years of fixed interest at the lei, up of 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
on the other hand, the transylvania bank's offer conversion was accepted by 83% of credit customers in francs due two successive cuts: the soil has been reduced to the value of risk and administration fees paid paid by the customer, then then an additional 22.5% reduction has to the soil to the soil in lei.
both offers reduce the rates of their own clients, from much they paid equivalent equivalent to the lbefore before conversion.
thus, the transylvania bank reduces rate by 42.5%, and the banpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretitheory, by 18% over the coming years.
benefits
the main advantage of coweather in credit lions in chchf is that foreign risk risk is eliminated with the consumer protected by the future franc increases, and the repayment of the credit will be in the currency where they collect their salary.
another major advantage of both offers for conversion is that property is-evaluation is being made, additional guarantees are further required and another proof of revenue.
basically, no new financial and legal analysis will be made of credit, nor will there be additional costs as with refinancing.
both banks also offer a reduction at the monthly rate, from much customers customers paid before conversion, equivalent to leu.
risks
the problem is that the rate in the first years is formed more of interest and the customer repays very little of mainly.
the offer of the very low ban's offer in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
however, it is unclear how this interest will evolve after three years.
the margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25%, so in total, and the cost reduction is lower.
a possible risk to all credits in the variable interest lei, is that the robor index increase significantly over the coming years (more (more than the libor - chf) index.
for example robor every three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013, it reached reached 6% in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days in 2008 exceeded 40%!
furthermore, it is possible to defend other costs, mentioned in the initial offer.
it is time for decisions on the interest rate for the us federal reserve reserve
the world looks looking eye to the scheduled scheduled in two days, on wednesday and thursday, when us federal reserve makes a crucial decision whether or not increase raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
in a reuters poll poll with the participation of 80 economists, just over half that last week thought the decision would be taken, i now believe the situation will remain a time and that interest rates would be kept within the current 0-0.25%.
it is an historic event because it has been seven years since the federal reserve brought brought rates to zero.
for the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could drop zero zero rate and a process of normnormalisation of interest rates, " " said angel ubide, chief analyst at chief analyst of the peterson institute for international economics.
the us economy has developed relatively well, with the recovery by bringing usd trillion to the balance sheet and generating a level of low inflation.
but the federal reserve must not ignore the global situation less less roz.
he has warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
the decision will be announced on tuesday, 20 00 the tec.

player luke shaw in manchester united stands on bara several months due to double fracures.
luke shaw suffered a double fracture at his right leg in manchester united match in the champions league, with a defeat before psv eindhoven.
after the event that brought his tears to the player's eyes and keep ara for at least six months, louis van gaal remains optimistic that shashaw once again be able to play this season again.
the accidental came after a reckreckless intervention by hhéctor moreno in the 15th minute after shaw, 20, broke the psv defence.
he received medical care for nine minutes on the field and he needed oxyen before he went to hospital.
van gaal said " " has dual fracture on the leg and he is in hospital. "
it will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps the day after then it will be operated in manchester.
it is appalling - a boy who has come to manchester united when he was 18, has difficulties difficulties then then plays fantastic, and now this is happening.
in the west, he was mask by oxyen.
she complaint.
i am not a doctor, but at the double fracture it is for six months and will not play in the phase of groups.
i hope that they can play this season once again.
it seems that moreno has had luck and has escaped escaped the red card and the concession of a coup.
arbite nicola rizzoli has not punish mexican mexican.
van gaal suggested that the italian official had been wrong.
you can judge alone when they say that it is fault fault and the red card.
it was a very hate intervention with two legfeet.
a message on shaw's twitter account: " thank you all for your messages, i do not have words to express how weakened i feel, i start the road to recovery, i will return stronger. "

the defender of the england team team has another reason to recover to play at the european championship in france next june.
phillip cocu, coach psv, said, " it's a very uginjury. "
everyone is very sad when a player suffers suffering such an injury.
our players never seek to injured an adversary.
moreno broke broken his leg for mexico national national against the of of netherlands led by van gaal at the 2014 world championship.
" it is very difficult because he did not intend to hurt his adversary, and when you hear that it is a very serious accidinjury,, it's good thing, " cocu said.
i have not seen phase.
i only managed to see the ball, who was heading in another direction direction so it appeared that [moreno] achieved but but could not see the intervention on luke.
in the statement for sbs6, moreno said:' i know how it is, i know how difficult it is to move through this.
i feel ill fobias, i am so sorry.
psv player player andrés guardado also arrived to hospital after an intervention by chris smalling.
adam lyth clearly rised england's omission but is still still loud.
the victory against pakistan in the united arab emirates is a difficult task but, having seeing the england team team for the tournament, i do not consider a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
i would not eliminate the variversion of a travelling victory.
perhaps alastair cook's team has less experience than three years ago, but it has good players spks in the batting line and the collective moris strong strong; they will not be marked by events in 2012 but will have a positive attitude to youth.
moeen ali is as as spinner and adil rashid, although it is unknown to the test level, is an option for the attack.
similar topics: adam lyth left left england england team for the matches and was replaced by alex hales.
obviously, as his leading coach coach in yorkshire, i am very difficult look analyse the decision not to select adam lyth on the team.
he played the seven test matches against two good attackers, under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are being tried after the results.
there were no question questions about joe root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and i said this earlier - the players are their own selection.
any fifty years and perhaps lyth would have extended his run run, but his destiny is in its hands.
i hope that if it makes more run run for yorkshire will have other opportunities.
the leading coach of the england team, trevor bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance was not equal to his capacity and i does not surprise me; above all, he is a team man.
it is hard to answer the question as long long a batsman is noted in the test games.
lyth had seven run run - as like sam robson before him - while nick compton had nine.
only compton had luck at home and in travel.
the only dissatisfaction that you can have was that england preferred jonathan trott t on the caribbean tour - when lyth was most shape - but that missed opportunity is something of the past.
the team team comes from alex es, a batsman sman that i call very well.
it is a cricket player who has the " factor x " and which i noted earlier in yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a pitch trent bridge.
it should be be given the same opportunity as those before them, but this will certainly depend on the composition of the uae team.
the idea was under launched that moeen would open to beating alongside cook, which which would lead extra spinner while preserving four quichks, and i have nothing against.
i do not see why a carter could not strike there, and this lefsy player has already shown that he is nato naive.
perhaps moeen may not bring success in his district, worcestershire re but it was 3 for them, so the difference is not big.
my old colleague of team, justin langer, played his first 38 test matches 38 as first drop before entering the open in 2001.
it immediately deleted three centuries and did not look behind.
zafar ansari comes to the team of back-up spinner and, although i had limited contact with him,, struck struck me that he is very impressive young young.
people could judge frageda age -- with an average of 31 to death and 35 at the ball -- and they may think it is pun, but there is no lot of thorniny and the selection opted for young youth.
much will be learn from this tournament.
england has also brought a few changes to the training team.
the appointment of mahela jayawardene, batsman of sri lanka, as consultant consultant the test matches could be a master blow.
it is one of the best players and it will bring plenty of experience, as he has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
paul collingwood comes to white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and unless ambition.
i have always believed that he was born to engage in the international cricket whether a player player a coach, and like mahela, he he had intintution.
sometimes, new voices in the west, even if they send messages that have been sent earlier, can bring fresh air into the team.
the teammate of colly durham, ben stokes is rest for one-day matches, root received a similar break against australia, and i have no problem with that.
although not all agree, tracoaches and selection do not make the programme.
and you must remember note, players players' jobs depend on the results they achieve.
such decisions are never being made easily.
brexit camp could win if the economy remains in som by 2017
every day day,, strategy strategy for renegotiate david cameron to keep great britain into the eu is getting into the mess mess, even without election election of jeremy jeremy " yes or not? " corbyn at the helm of the labour party or tuc party brings serious criticism of europe on tuesday.
foreigners also have characfigures such as corbyn and nigel farages.
a european diplomat explained last days days that -- merged in crises similar to that in the eu -- not all caused internally - some member states are being fed by britain uk agenda agenda concessions concessions and changes to the treaties, which the majority do not want.
in brighton, during the annual meeting, tuc decided that they do not want it either they they erode social protection.
we could even call it' sel' agenda of dave and george agenda.
the prime minister and chancellor chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, make a picture before a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then then return home home and say they have won allies for reform.
it is just about me.
my european friend, who wants great britain with an outside perspective under the eu roof " do not leave us with france, " berlin says -- suggests that more ministers and obtuofficials from certain capitals have come reached the point where they do not care whether they remain stay or leave.
angela merkel, the extremely cautious german chancellor, is an ally but has stood leadership for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation clails, as happened to thatcher (11 years), mitterrand (14) and kohl (16) who stood too much.
in 2017, french president françois hollande will be re-elected or re-replaced.
his power is also declining.
poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, spain left wing left.
it is hard to believe that they will help the english who pose, whose energy would be better better used to prevent scotland from leaving britain - something something they do do not want either, because majority have similar separatist tendencies.
thus, some ministers could even plan to make remarks that do not help in the style of snp in the campaign for the uk referendum in 2017 to speed speed up the brexit process, my friend suggests.
" the renegotiation has been fixed " and " britain has achieved nothing of value from the renegotiation. "
europeans know their skskin how powerful fleet street can be, and how sceptical the oligarchic press barons who view the eu with scepticism, because they did not take part in the 1975 referendum inspired inspired tony benn, which ratified our entry from 1973 in report 2: 1.
he may recall vague of boris johnson, the euro-opportunist, became become famous in the early 1990s when he was co reent of brussels.
ed miliband knew his enemies.
they included included mixmix of tax-paypaypun, foreigners who fraudfraudulent teletelephone and pseudo non-me who hold most the important newspapers.
in fact, tony blair see them about the same but he has realised that when you are closed in a chle with a nervous gorila, you have to give him the bananas to distrtheir attention from the thought of eat at noon and again to the tea.
in fact, miliband was more blfied than blair in opposition to cameron's referendum idea, given blair blair made a concession on the principle to the abandoned abandoned eu constitution, was buried by french and dutch voters in 2005, who gave him an exit card.
the media did not forgive him for that either.
but jeremy corbyn, who reached me friend by the back monday at westminster - i told him not consuming his time with me - it seems to be at danger of adopting the murdoch strategy from egg to boycott neil kinnock out the 1980s 1980s, a mistake then and now.
it can last, but it must develop a coherent strategy for cooperation cooperation strategy not not me, but certainly with andrew marr, whose position at the bbc left a vacation holiday sunday.
corbyn's official position towards europe is what i would call the development with induleniency.
he says he would like us to remain in a reformed eu.
most of those who disagree with the conservatives'' angism' could agree to that.
that said hilary " a benn, but not a bennite " benn on radio and tv this week when the researcher in he fought not to recognise that the appointment of john mcdonnell by corbyn as minister " shashadow shadow " on financial issues was a bad idea.
he reminded me of the 1970s, when his father struggled on tv to be unfair to labour colleagues without going too far and losing his office in the cabinet.
hilary's struggle has been more attractive.
but the fight to remain " in any situation " -- benn's expression - does not correspond with what mcdonnell said, nor with what the jc told to colleagues and lawmakers at a private meeting monday night.
regardless of the image that corbyn wants to convey - take note, he also made me - the discipline of the messages remains important in the era of television, and particular in the poth of the social networks, hotbed of paranoia and betraon.
it is right not not not be cameron cameron a favour ticket in europe, allowing allowing him to take good support of labour in the referendum campaign, as mcdonnell said.
simon jenkins certainly believes that.
but the basic histry of mcdonnell and corbyin on eu membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer a hesoterterdiscussion among leftist dissidents for whom small narnarism of small differences is a central dogma.
as in the case of histry on nato -- tom watson is adamant that the jc will not campaign exit exit -- foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand.
why should paris or political capital berlin waste waste away - and there are suspicious voters there - concessions concessions britain britain everything everything be unnecessary?
the us is already quite disappointed about the weak british performance military performance in iraq, libya and syria, even with a conservative government that cuts cutting costs, as i have reminded reminded at the launch of british influence security forum on monday.
specialists criticise england public health department's decision on electronic cigarettes
according to researchers, claims by a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking have resulted from meeting between 12 people, some of them with links in the tobacco industry.
specialists from the british medical journal's editorial team (bmj) have joined the lancet in criticising the evidence used by the england public department of ((tions) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
the mentor published the " reference reference report report last month and described it as a " complex analysis of evidence. "
several researchers, however, have questioned the robuness of data and pointed the finger at links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
an article published last month in the lancet medical magazine attacked the " extraordinarily fragile base " on founded its professionalism of the main conclusion.
two other researchers writing in bmj have questioned the claims and base them " on solid soil or on missand. "
martin mckee, european public health professor at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine and simon capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at liverpool university, have said: " a fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on effective effectiveness. "
they said that they expect claims claims of the claims that' current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking' are being based on in-analysis of the evidence and models.
in reality, only single meeting by 12 people has led to the drafting of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (mcda) that summarises their views in regard on the negative effects associated with various products products contain niconicotina; the results of this meeting have been put edput up in a research work.
mckee and capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called euroswiss health, whose whose executive director said to have have received past funding from british american tobacco conduct an independent study.
it also validated the accreditation of bat in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
they added that one of 12 participants in the meeting said funding received from a producer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding reports reports would have received the cigarette and tobacco producer company philip morris international.
no arguments have been provided on which members members of the were were selected but include some " leaves leaves " " known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even say funding for the work.
other participants in the meeting are known for expertise in tobacco control.
the meeting also attended by the head of the tobacco tobacco control section in the rehabilitation.
the research work drafted by the group " blbitsively " that the lack of " solid evidence of the detrimental effect that most products has having in most of the criteria " mckee and capewell said.
however, in the report of the, none of these links or limitations are mentioned.
mckee and capewell said claims claims the said that " so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among the children or non non-smokers " are premature.
professor kevin fenton, director of the department of health as part the rehabilitation, says it was responded in the past to claims in bmj.
he said " electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking. "
one in two people who have smoking all life losing their lives because of this vice.
all the evidence suggests that the risk of electronic cigarettes cigarettes for health are minor compared, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
hungarians has a clear duty to inform the public about the information arising and those that do not come out of evidence, especially given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
annually, around 80,000 people lose their lives from a smoking-related disease and the annual costs of the national health system to smoking reach gbp 2 billion.
by expressing the evidence clearly - that is that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risk, they are only present a fraction of the malnicious effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national debt.

violinist david grimal: in bach era era there were no world tournaments.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enănescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
french violonist david grimal is of the great artists of our times, known only as guest but also an initiator of a less project, to right entitled " strange ", as he himself says, les dissonances - an orchestra made up international international soloists ists and talented musicians, who talmusicians musicians, interpreting a symphony repertoire, and that makes it it a conductor.
les dissonances was this year at the enescu festival with two performances: a performance sunday where solist was david grigrimal, founder of the orchestra,, and one month, when the plan was violcelist xavier phillips, the work being carried up by enescu being nelipsite.
both performances, on the athens stage, showed the public public another kind of interpret classical music.
les dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 was at the time, the only classical picture in which there was no conductor.
the conductor is the most important ician for musicians.
it is true, on the one hand musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - i speak about instruments, and not composers.
they are formtrained as' specialised workers'.
they themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.
on the other side of the scene, for the public, all the musical complaint focuses on the conductor.
and so the business, music industry industry is making marketing.
therefore we we no talking about music.
so, if we view this world, we have qualified workers qualified workers, which is stupid, and a public that cannot listen, but has to look, what and it is stupid, " considers david grimal.
violonist tells that this change in the way of music came from " musical discepors " from his solist career.
i was like a high-level athlete who to make the same exercise throughout the world with different orchestras, to earn lot of money money and also bring money to the music industry.
10 years ago, when we had around 30 years ago, i found this very depressing, because we had longer found human creativity and fraternity in this system.
so we therefore found no sense in continuing along this road.
that is how i decided to create les dissonances.
this was in 2004, and at the time, no one was doing so without a conductor:' the music, highly conservative, did not want such projects'.
" how can you imagine doing marketing with a collective of of musicians where there longer ego? " the artist asks.
david grimal acknowledges that les dissonaces is " a luxury, " pointing out that none of the musicians in the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
in 10 years of having the ens, the lack of a conductor did not prove obstacles in the musical act: " curously, the we weigh a a more complex repertoire, the simpler simple, because all musicians are obliged to be in opera and not just in a role,, " " grimal, adding that sunday's performance " we were 74 conductors. "
in grimal's view, the enescu festival is a " very courageous " precisely because it invited les dissonances:' an extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras present in the world that sing and 3 times a day, and in the middle of these invited-orchestorchestras and this strange group. "
in a temple of the orchestorchesttradition, such such as the ennescu festival, there is a place and interest in something different that breaks barriers.
speaking about enescu's work, the violist acknowledges acknowledges he feels romanian music of the famous romanian comer, so he did not need need a special approach when he introduced ennnescu escu works on his repertoire.
grimal notes that enescu escu music music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk to george enescu and romanian music, " because there is also a george ăescu escu who did french music. "
grimal is advocating for the change of how classical musical education is done, believing that " " musician profession, as it is organised today, has a death iz ur' " and that the future of music is music itself. "
we do not need to make the world tour 5 times a year if it does serve for nothing.
in the age of bach there were no world tours.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu escu people who working, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
for me, organising concerts, festivals, tourntournaments, launching albualbum, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done at the service of music.
if not, we are in a system in which creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
to illustrate this phenomenon, david grimal set example to romanian products before and post after join the eu: " in romania, before you enter the eu, had good vegetables and meat. "
to enter the eu, you had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables vegetables for meat.
production and agriculture come at the service of the supermarkets, as is in france.
with music is the same, it is the same logic.
les sters makes tomatoes may not too beautiful, but when cutting them are true tomatoes.
in an ideal world, this music should go back to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system to understand that music does not need to be sold but needs needs to be shared, and this can done starting with education policy.
" if we considered -- as the koreans, chinese chinese the japanese -- that western music is one of the most beautiful things, we would reintroduce his learning to school, we would reintroduce the television concerts television and this education would no need to sell musical music-products, " grimal believes.
there are certainly things in classical musical education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarised.
it depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if form form musician who will perform to an instrument and, first of all, a musician.
we talk about a completely different education if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) it must be in a way if we want to form a musician, it is completely else.
after your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier soldier or a musician? " the french artist smilsmiling.
grimal shows that, the artists, reward another different kind of the music comes precisely from overcoming this' soldier' status, overcoming overcoming what' they believe think they are their limits':' the musicians discover at some time that they are not soldiers, and that is why why after the concert come zambitors. "
david grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and his artist in the " festival of ideas, " a discussion with the public at the george enescu international festival by the aspen romania institute.

fededex gains are mixed, subdown the fiscal forecasts for 2016
fedex declared disappointing results for the last quarter, with the supply giant reducing the estimates of profit for the whole year due to low demand for transport services and the increased costs for its land transport division.
the company also said it plans to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
during the same period last year, fedex announced he would employ 50,000 seasonal workers workers for holiday holidays.
the company's shares dropped by about 2.5% in the pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound wednesday wednesday opening opening.
fedex corp. said he expects expected to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in may next year with 20 cents less according to an previous estimate.
analysts expected $$10.84, according to a poll by factset.
the declining estimate comes despite price hikes by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 january and higher oversurs for land transport of large or high weight weight packages, which will apply since november.
the company said it is still expecting increased gains from the previous year as a of reduced costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
president president general general fred smith said " " the firm faces a considerably weaker economic situation than expected especially in terms of global production and trade. "
employment plans for the holiday holidays were announced a day after ups rival tor said it plans to employ 90,000 to 95,000 workers, about the same number of employment made last year.
in the quarter that ended on august 31st, fedex won $692m, 6% more than the previous year.
gains per action were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per action by 12 analysts who responded to the zacks investment research survey.
the profit rose by 5 5 cent, to $12.3 billion.
six analysts participating attended zacks estimau u survey $12.23 billion.
fedex company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, which led to stagnation in revenues registered by its unit express.
but the explosion in online shopping salsed the results of the fedex ground division.
in the last quarter, revenues from the ground division rose rose by 29%, but operational revenues practically stalled stalled due to higher costs for large packages and their own own insurance.
the unit express registered an increase in revenues due to higher basic charges, while revenues from the freight division division dropped due to rising costs.
in the pre-market trading trading about about an hour before the opening sound, fefedex actions dropped by usd 3.85 or 2.5%, to usd 150.15.
on tuesday, it dropped by 11% on a year-level and 17% from the maximum record on 11 11th.
at the most awaited meeting in recent years, the policy-making makers within the federal reserve will spend two days this week around a mahmahtable table honduras honduras on 27 27 feet to decide decide whether the time has come to increase a key interest rate this week for the first time in almost a decade.
above them, at an end of the central bank's hall, there will be al painting of the united states.
the map is intended to recall that janl. yellen, the president of the edf, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all.
the central bank has received a dual fold task from congress: to maximise the employment rate in the us and to maintain price stability.
but since the great economic crisis, the edf leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
and this third task could be the factor x in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced tuesday, which will determine whether the us economy is ready to be dispelated by the unprecedented stimulus offered by the short-term interest rate interest rate in force starting since the end of 2008.
even though most data points to a strong growing economy, the recent turmoil on the global financial markets could hope hoped edf officials are already cautious of the addition of volatility by the increase in the reference rate to federal funds - even only a quarter of a percentage point.
" obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues to pursue, " said lindsey m. piegza, a chief economist at the firm of brokeraj stifel nicolaus & co.
" but i believe that if they looked seek an excuse not to increase the interest rate, rising uncertainty in the world market is enough to give them with arguments arguments to wait longer, " she said.
there is no consensus on the decision that the edf will take, which itself causing instability in the financial market.
about half of the economists recently questioned by bloomberg anticipated an increase interest rate increase this week.
but the financial markets expect the edf to postpone, with a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30%.
this would indicate a drop on exchange if the edf increases the interest rate, except those who develop policies would mitigate the blow by promising to take long time until the next growth.
on tuesday, the industrial average dow jones moved up 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent to 16.599.85.
the momentum was triggered by expectations that edf decision makers will maintain the stable interest rate this week, john lonski, chief chief economist moody's's capital markets research group.
" it would be surprising that the edf increase increase interest rate at this moment, " lonski said.
if the edf decision makers do so,' they should act thoroughly in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets. "
other experts have said an increase in the interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty uncertainty when the edf would act.
just a month ago, the edf seemed to be to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the us recovery recorecovery force.
yellen said in spring and early summer that he expected an interest rate increase this this year despite objections raised by the liberals that more economic progress were needed.
although the creation of jobs slowed in august, the labour market growth was sound this year.
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and near the level considered by the edf as full employment.
wage gains showed signs of growth.
and although inflation continued not to meet the central bank's annual objective, the edf decision makers said that a key reason has been the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices.
the economy " can cope with at higher rates and needs them, given the tension in the labour market, " ian shepherdson, who senior chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics.
but the global financial markets began to enter fibrilations later this month after china china devalued its currency.
the dow jones industrial average dropped by 16% below the record maximum reached in may, because investors have feared that the slowslowdown in the chinese economy would pull down world growth.
the market observed somewhat somewhat this month, the dow index index now about 10 per cent below the maximum in may.
for edf edf decision makers, the stir on the market is added to the complex calculation of times of increasing the interest rate.
" without what happened on the financial markets and the news about weakening weakening the chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be firm at the sitting, " said stephen d. oliner, experienced-experienced researcher at the ucdu in ziman center for real estate, and a former edf edf.
now, he expects to wait at least a month to manage the effects better.
" there is very much uncertainty about what the impact be on the us economy, and they almost have no data that rely based on events in china, " oliner said.
the welfare of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the edf, so it should not be taken into account in decision making.
but, in reality, the edf has become the world monetary authority.
in recent years, the central bank's influence has been huge.
the mere sion of then-president, ben s. bernanke, in 2013 that the edf could could' narrow' its monetary expansion has triggered the earthquake in the world markets.
in a world in which markets and economies are increasingly coming increasingly more, edf is expected that edf officials not not only monitor progress made in other areas, but also to consult consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
his decision-making process is " more art than science, " said zachary karabell, head of the global strategy department in the welfare management firm envestnet inc.
jeffrey lacker, federal federal reserve bank president richmond, va. said this month that " edf has a historic of over dimensional response to changes in the financial market that appear to not related to economic foundations. "
lacker, a right-voting member of the federal committee on the open market, a decision-making body, which advocated increase in interest rate, provided as example example the 1998-99 decisions.
a financial crisis that has affected asia led the edf to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, " despite implications with limited identification possibility for development of the us, " lacker said.
a year later, edf officials returned returned their drop.
the edf should raise the issue of financial stability only in the event of a major crisis such as the 2008 market earthquake, said adam s. posen, a former member of the interest rate commission at the bank of england.
the last turbulent period is not far far to that level, he said.
" we certainly certainly do not want to get to a situation to fear about an interest rate rate rate because markets have upset upset, " said said posen, president peterson institute for international economics.
the federal reserve act still has the dual mandate and does does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, i do not believe that it should take take premature action.

the protests were also in west western nepal, where the tharus ethnic group wants its own state.

weight-reduction surgery could be useful in light diabetics with easy obesity.
the benefits of cyrily to weight in the case of light obesity, with type 2 diababet sugar sugar could remain for at least five years, according to a new study.
it is still premature to say whether easy obeabtes with light obeabtes live more after sursurical loss loss intervention than those who follow unhirurgical treatments.
" there is a long needed to centralise data on mortality, " said dr robin blackstone, a specialist on obesity surgery, car she wrote an article on the new study in jama surgery.
operations for waste weight, names and surgeon barrier barrier barrier, use various methods to reduce dental.
they reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
over the years, surgeon the barrier barrier has proved efficiency in treatment treatment 2 type class diabetet, but most of the studies were conducted on obesity people morbida with a corporate mass index (imc) 35 or higher.
the imc, unit of measure of weight in relation to size, is normal in the range of 18.5-24.9.
the imc value of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and the imc more than 30 are regarded as obses.
you can calculate your imc by accessing: 1.u.gov / 1d0zqdv.
for the new study, researchers at taiwan's general min-sheng hospital used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of surgeon the barrier barrier - bypass gastric and gastrectomie in manson - in the medical treatment of the 2-type sugar dietetabet sugar to light obesity.
the imc environment to people who suffered surgery surgery has dropped from 31 to 24.5 to the end of fifth fifth year part of the study.
meanwhile, the imc to people who received unhirurgical treatments against sugar sugar diabet was remained close at the same level that is 29.
of those who suffered surgeical intervention, sugar sugar diabet has sold completely to 36% and partly to 28%.
in the group's through medical methods, by comparison, the sugar diabet has sold sold to only 1% and partly to only 2% of the subjects.
in addition, control of terrible tension, triglicerideidele and lcholesterol ol " evil " were generally better in the surgery group, " the authors concluded.
researchers researchers also monitored the sangulevel of hemoglobina a1c c which reflects the level of gschool over time.
researchers write that the optimal level of hemoin a1c is below 7%.
after surgeical intervention, the average level of a1c a1c has dropped from around 9% to about 6%.
but in the group's treaty through medical methods, it has maintained at around 8%.
but this improved " glicemcontrol control -- reflected by the improved levels of a1c hemoglobe -- have not reduced the mortality rate to five years, according to chief researcher dr dr. chih-cheng hsu and fellow colleagues.
the research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surical intervention.
in the fifth year compared to the gastrectomgroup in manson, the sursursurgery group lost more in weight (18.7% from 14.2 kg kg) recorded higher drop c value falls (7.4 compared to 5.1) and hemoemoglobin a1c (3.1% from 2.1% and presented higher rereability.
although the new study does not indicate a benefit to survival or surgery years later, there is evidence from a study by high-weight people in sweden that surgeical intervention extends life, says says blackstone of the arizona university, the faculty of medicine - phoenix.
in the swedish study, obese people who have suffered surgery on the barrier barrier presented a probability about 29% lower of die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
although the new study did not indicate a benefit to survival at patients who suffered surgery intervention, blackstone said it is an optimistic for people with imc under 35 interested in the procedure.
" this is the point where this work is critical, because it says this surical intervention is safe in the lower immune group group " without increasing the risk of death or renillness, she says.
blackstone added that the patients and their doctors should start -- take the weight seriously then the patient's anthem reaches to 27-30.
" i think we expect too much before we urge people to take this seriously, " she said.
i believe that once they have acquired these genetic changes that have short circucircutheir bodies disposing them to obeesity and diabet, it is extremely difficult for difficult to return to normal.

why i witness see execution in oklahoma
later today, in exception of late legal intervention, i will look at how a man is sentenced to death.
if happens, and i hope not not happen, i will stand in a room for observers from the execution hall of the oklahoma prison prison hall and i will see how richard glossip is executed by administration ering the latvian injection.
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
the invitation first came in january, through his best friend, and, although i was shocked, i accepted.
as the day approaches with death, i am appalled about the idea.
so why why?
i agreed because i thought that it was a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
it would provide a unique perspective.
it is true, journalists can see executions in america and, because usually usually usually exceed beyond number number of available places, a macabra lolotertery to decide who will be elected.
oklahoma has reduced the number of seats for media representatives from 12 to five.
those elected will look at impartiimpartial execution.
i cannot do that.
i would stand alongside the closest friends of richard glossip, moreover i have developed my own link with him over the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two half hours.
i like the type.
we often deplore a great deal when we speak.
prison authorities say they cannot be a witness and a journalist, so i will not be allowed to have a carnet el and pipix to note what i see.
i will have to try to remind all of the details.
a journalist in oklahoma has accused twitter of compromising my impartiality.
that is the lesson.
he tells the story of the holder as he wants wants, it gets access.
i complained about it.
he admitted that' he could have formula better', but he still believes that i am wrong.
richard glossip did agreed with some of the things i have said and have written.
he does not tell me what to write and i would not do it if they asked me.
i told him that he could remove me from the list of witnesses any time.
however, it wants an international report be present to write on the subject.
he believes that, if it dies, advertising will help the movement against the death penalty.
kim bellware, reporter with huffington post, will be with me.
if you want to learn more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files files we have made.
i will not come back here to all the details.
i cannot say with certainty that richard glossip is innocent.
his actions after the murder van treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
but i think it is very likely not to be guilty of murder.
i certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
i believe that his execution is wrong.
and i will watch it dirdying from this perspective.
i cannot pretend that they are totally objective.
for this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
from me, you will learn how it is watch a man i like like by dying unnecessarily.

i night i will go home and will slepeace in ease.
i want to go with my head e high and i want the owners i work to see i am strive to give them what is best.
since they start to believe that this is not the case, they must to abandon the trainer profession.
at that time i will have to consider what i will do with my certification.
earlier, moody threw the bomb in an interview with racing.com, which said the integrity department has tried to spy the raids.
" eighteen months ago, terry bailey, dayle brown and mr dr brian stewart stood in a room with a man -- whose name i will tell say if i am asked - and offered to commit him to my raids to provide information about the work there, ", told moody for racing.com.
obviously obviously i consider me a trisor.
if this is so, then they should all their resignation because because they were incompetent in an attempt to catch me.
robert roulston, former president rvl, david moodie, current president of rl and bernard saundry, current executive ceo of rvl, knew at the time and i know know today.
should i think that this is something personal?
is it necessary for the rvl to start having the backbone and can hold people accountable outside the trainations for what happens happening the industry?
do i have bad influence on industry?
so bad is my influence on industry?
perhaps that is how way others see others.
perhaps he has to take my license and give me aside, and i do no doubt that the statements that i are making could lead them think about this option.
however, i reached reached point where i no longer care and i am saddened.
i am very sad.
i will put pressure and lead them to make a decision.
my family is supporting me and i can leave me.
the frustration of the traer grew with a long standing investigation into testing at cobalt involving which leaders involved and the elimination led him to say he could " place his license on the table. "

it could have happened last night.
it could have happened yesterday, which happened.
it was the day of the race.
moody could be disqualified for three months for the day day of race race in applying of aplaplma for which stewarguards opened an investigation.
it is a joke.
people who do these rules do know anything about horses.
" we all understand that rules are needed but it has gone too far, " moody said.

coach melbourne storm, craig bellamy, named criticism of his team's plactactics as " distorted topics " raised by the two two main ites in nrl.
sydney coach roosters, trent robinson said the referees allowed players in storm to " take them in the tranta " the team in the won nervovos storm storm in the qualification final late evening in sydney.
brisbane bancoach broncos, wayne bennett, made slight slight to storm after his team's victory in the north queensland cowboys qualifying qualifying match late saturday, when he called a " demonstration " of the league of rugleague, and said the two teams queensland land not too pricep in wrestling.
bellamy jumped in defence of the placting tactics addressed by his team, and said the players simply focusing on " contact " when they plates.
bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticised criticised his team, meaning that they were concerned that storm would defeat them.
" and things do not stop there here -- i did not hear trent robinson to complain about the wrestling when beating us 24-2 " belbellamy said wednesday.
i can guarantee that we have changed nothing every year in our defensive systems or techniques, as only as in the last six weeks we have indeed focused on contact in plactions and so we have changed the situation.
trent has been in office for three years, and it obviously has a wonderful team so it is probably not used to lose and it was a shock to him.
we know how it is always happening during this period of year.
bellamy contradicagreed benbennett idea " " animating football, " his mentor st george-illawarra dragons of bennetwon the championship in 2010 playing " boring " football.
wayne talks about palpittuant football.
he argued his opinion by comparhis game saturday saturday with our game on friday evening and spoke about how pitthe game was, " bellamy said.
i remember that in 2010, st george had received many criticism because he was a borboring team and wayne said he did not interested him as unblack black under angle.
but now now has a team that can play what we would consider as pittufootball football especially because to the striking young midfielder.
the kind of game do you want to do it when you have such players.
he brought this argument in 2010, he now wants everyone to adopt its game style game not any team has two midfielders like anthony milford and ben hunt in order to play the way.
it gives me more confidence because they say saying this because they am somewhat concerned about the match with us.
six weeks ago they probably probably not think us when they thought the important matches.
bellamy also stressed that the match between storm and roosters was a more bitter penalty er compared to broncos and cowboys.
the match cos broncos was probably a good match, have we not seen it yet how was score score 16-12?
our match ended up 20-18, in our game were two more attempts, does that means palpiting game?
or palpitant means making making breaks and not increase?
for me plans are plans.
if i speak about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play home either north queensland cowboys or cronulnulla sharks, in final final of the preliminary preliminary next saturday in aami park, with tickets tickets on sale starting next morning.

friendsfest: the comseries that taught us important lessons about the friendship between male friendship
the absence of similar figures in the series is obvious, since the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, suicisuicide rates among young men reaching the peak of the past 15 years.
in 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 years in britain, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
in an bid to address the problem the campaign against against unfortunate (campaign against living miserably (calm) campaign designated 2015 as the year of the man, seeking to to question the culture that prevents men from asking for when they need.
friendship is lies at the heart of the fight to this challenge success.
a recent study conducted over more than 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression concluded concluded that if the patient is surrounded by sufficiently many friends " with a healthy mood, " his chances for recovery doudouble.
to the same extent, for people are not suppressed, a circle of mental healthy friends halhalhalf the problikelihood of mental disorders.
of course, for that friendship to have effect, it must must primarily be accessible.
in this era of the communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis on style and not on the substance, the immediate nature the response often often given priority ahead of the meaningful contact.
our digital lives have doubled the need to create the apparent appearance of a strong, figure open to fun and success, even if in reality, it is the isolation that ates.
this superficial success is dominated by what psychpsychologists call extrinite values; money, the image, social status, all at the cost of intrintrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which even even deeply affects our mental health.
the billiaire aire aire inventor of a video game recently explained the money really does not buy happiness.
the beauty of serifriends has been to have focused attention to this idea.
the ters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, whom they showed by interacting as friends.
the mour of joey's frequent boarding and chandler, moments when watch football in the coment ent seats and the passion of ross for rachel came from the is known that men can associate with with this, though often they to completely explore their feelings.
as a social worker has explained to me:'... my role to listen to the people with the suicide and pressed trend has shown how even the smallest interaction with friends can make a difference..
often, people appealing to us do not feel able to speak with friends.
his old saying is doing alone is strong, as is the feeling to be perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
friends is one of the series that come to mind when i try to offer provide long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
the series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
as much as objective, outside intervention intervention helps, via the phone, people have arrived in times of desperair, long-term support comes from the family and close friends.
thus, if you attend this week weekend in central sfest organised by central comedy edy with full restoration of filplatforms to celebrate the event, why not invite friends to a coffee in central perk.
or, even better, if you can see someone alone in starbucks, smilsmiled and welcome.

but if someone expected that the bsp to win the victory from their fingers, they were disappointed.
malmo, who beat the celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine holders at national teams, with a defence from five people and two defensive midfielders was a strong challengsary.
but their attack was not impressive, with exception exception the submission of nikola djurdjic who went passed kevin trapp in the 34th minute.
instead, the bsp players have slowed the pace several times, giving several unnecessary passes and not finalising the interventions, even ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts attempts only in the first first half, and was then replaced by cavyears even after the resumption of the game.
ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skill in supporting his colleagues, with his care being that di maria sent to a suted by wilover the gate in the 52nd minute.
the second goal was eventually after an hour took out in the match, thanks to cavani, uruguayan who scored the sixth goal in season after ibrahimovic passed from maxwell.
this goal removed those people malmmalmo hope they would rebalance the score and only a superstop wilwilfrom the distance to rejection of david luiz kept the final score before the newly new ezequiel lavezzi cancel an goal in extensions.
the norwegian coach of the team in malmo, bitter y age later later said the bsp was a fish class and that " the last match we played in the champions league was last december. "
since then, we have only played in the swedish league, which does not match the same level.

ponta, charged of uncontrolled slander and irrational statements
hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto condemned harsh on wednesday morning, what romanian prime minister victor ponta said political decision makers in hungary are " nothing better than those those those syria syria libya libya or other countries fleeing refugees refugees. "
" yesterday, victor ponta lost self-control and, through his irrational statements, offoffends the entire hungary, " the hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
civilised european politicians do not say such such uncontrolled slander.
" his remarks have one explanation: it has lost lost full support in domestic politics in romania, " added the head of hungarian diplomacy, according to mti.
in a facebook posting on late evening, prime prime minister victor ponta said he wants to draw attention and sanction the behaviour of senior hungarian government officials, who he believe " are a disgrace for the eu culture and values. "
i do not want to respond to the challenges posed some hungarian government representatives.
" they are a disgrace for the eu's culture and the values; and in anti semitisemitiattitudes, and regarding the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now now during the refugee crisis!, " ponta said on facebook.
the romanian prime minister added that he is sensible and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, brutbrutand aggressive laws would not solve the problem.
barbed sarma, aggressive laws, prisons and brutbrutality will certainly not solve the problem - only show that in hungary, in the heart of europe, political decision decimakers are nothing better better than those in syria, libya or other countries from which refugees flee fleeing fleeing!
" i believe in solidarity, rational sensible sustainable sustainable solutions and especially the superiance of european values -- what we are seeing in the recent days in hungary is totally contradiction to precisely these objectives and values! " stressed the head of the romanian executive stressed.
earlier tuesday, hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto described as " simple lies " by romanian prime minister victor ponta remarks about hungary's management of refugee crisis, noting that those claims are inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to mti.
the head of hungarian diplomacy also noted on tuesday that " extremist and minor remarks " of the romanian prime minister concern the internal political crisis in romania and made it clear that budapest is awaiting apoapology from the romanian side.
szijjarto referred to a statement made monday by prime minister victor ponta.
what i have said and always say is that i am against xenophobic speeches the idea of close borders, that all those coming come are terrorists, are bbish by environmental ages and i i totally oppose this approach.
if we can receive more, we receive it, the problem is about our logistical capacity to treat those people as people, not as they treatwith our hungarian neighbours, knock and with the seriousness.
" with that what i do not agree, " the head of the romanian executive told a press conference in targu-jiu.
also on tuesday, peter szijjarto announced the budapest government decided to start preparations on the ground for extend the the ence border with romania that it is building on the serbian border to face possible change in the route used by migrants.
afterwards, prime minister victor ponta said hungary's decision to raise a border guarantor solve nothing out of refugee refugee and " takes hungary out of europe. "
what link exists between osama bin laden and collapse collapse mecmecca cranes
saudi authorities have announced that audit giant binladin group belonging to osama bin laden's family is " partly responsible " for the collapse of a crslauanes on friday on the grand mosque in mecca, which resulted left 107 people died.
according to an investigative committee, the company has not " comply with the safety rules, " saudi news agency (spa), the bbc reported.
the company's directors were banned ban leaving the country until the investigation is completed in the case.
the firm will also be ruled out from new public contracts.
the construction firm is owned by the family of former former leader of al-qaeda terrorist terrorist network osama bin laden.
the company was founded by osama bin laden's father 80 years ago and is currently headed by brother of the former terrorist leader, bakr.
binladen group has been working 4 years on the expansion of large mosques to be able to host several pilgrims.
the accident occurred on friday evening during a storm storm when a maccher, probably disbalanced by the powerful shelves of wind, collapsed on the eastern part of the roof the big mosque in mecca.

how the haghags ops closed the disputes
considered by many world romania biggest biggest footbalplayer in history, gica hagi has been labelled after his retirement from his job as a poor coach who cannot be able of perform in the new post.
after unfortunate experiences at the national national team, steaua or galatasaray, hagi took, a year ago, aching role in the constant future, the team it operates.
after a year after he assumed the team, the king showed that he is capable of transform a team struggling to save from downgrading to a top one.
thus, a year later, the future has recorded, with the haghagcoach, 16 victories, 11 stakes and 11 defeats.
the balance is one of a top team, is ctered at european cups.
things took an even better turn for the future in this season, as the team finished second in the 1st league with 19 points, one less than astra giurgiu leader.
the future also has best best in the 1 league, with 20 goals (equality with astra), more than double than flag.
on the other hand, even though he brought the team several experienced players, haghagi continued the policy to promote young people, and recently recently in the start team have names such as ianis hagi or hodorogea.
club club policy made the future a team to pursue for teams abroad, so hagi sold 1.5m euros this summer -- ianis hagi (fiorentina -- tina - 1m euros) and alexandru rita (bari - 500 euros).
along with the star, the future is the only profitable team in the 1 league according to trade trade registry data.
in the refugee crisis, romania has so far played as a small country.
it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
large countries come with solutions for the entire eu, says cristian ghinea, a member of the steering college of the romanian european policy centre.
in an interview with ziare.com, cristian ghinea has shown that europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and purely police means will not work in this crisis: " maybe we have have doubts about the quality of these people come from. "
but there are the ses that have been on, and we cannot return history.
migration is a reality to which we must adapt adapt as best and adapt them to us.
in the opinion of cristian ghinea, we are at an extremely emotional time, where politicians feel need to show show mucles.
after he passes, europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the schengen area must be changed:' schengen is now an animal set created in another age and which was not adapted to the situation now..
where are we in the refugee crisis after this jha council which, in fact, solved nothing?
it is clear that the ec president agreeing with donald tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
all the words said that they would have had the necessary votes.
before the treaty of lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in jha ha applied and any state could block any decision.
that is why things were very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
after lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the ec initiative, and the council approves with the vote of 55% of states, that is 16, which make account for 65% of the eu's population.
calculations said the votes were there.
but they did not want to go forward.
because it is a sensitive issue, reactions of rejection in germany itself against the policy of opening up chancellor merkel and did not want in many countries to defend as a reaction of the'' eu is sending migrants migrants the head'.
they have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave wave creating a huge problem for schengen governance, and we will probably see great changes there in the coming period.
so mandatory quotas have not really been eliminated, but has the subject was only left to fall further?
yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement by frontex in managing external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of the members who are on the external border of schengen to the responsibility of community agencies.
greece greek border with turkey is also germany german border with turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants gave the limits of the old schengen system.
perhaps it can be dropped from the dublin principle, whereby migrants are the responsibility of the state in which enter the first time, because it is not sustainable.
if greece caks, you cannot say say that it is is greece's job.
the problem is common common.
precisely because the problem is common, is it solution possible to without a precise, perhaps even binding mechanism, of sharing sharing of effort?
nobody knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work if it comes to them.
because there problem remains: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to romania or portugal, but in sweden or germany?
i do not believe that they will get european states to take the migrants high top: you go to the country x or the y y.
unique filcentres will probably reached filfilcentres in greece or turkey, where asylum applications are processed.
work is being done on solutions like this.
but the problem is not a simple solution.
there are countries that have many decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, are countries without any experience, like romania, where the problem of migrants will increase xenophobic trend.
the fact is that we are talking millions of people who are in turkey, in lebanon, jordan jordan who who sitting in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave to europe.
an estimate says that only 10% have set to leave, winter is hard to last the mediterranean, but we expect an even even larger wave next year.
what do we do with their people?
my sentence is that we will get used used to this problem, we will no longer look at as as media catastrophic.
talking by countries by countries with smaller or greater experience.
does seems to you that there is any place where has really managed to integrate large groups from an extra-european culture?
i look looking at gregreans in france, to turks in germany, they are increasingly enclaves.
i would not go towards radical statements.
of course their integration is more difficult than the case of other migration waves, but that does not mean they is not integrate at all.
it remains an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in france, germany, in britain.
but purely police means will not work.
let us create fortress europe is illusory sory.
it must be blled to the integration mechanisms in european societies.
there were some mistakes here.
we need to be more demanding.
let us ask these people learn learn language, try try take over values, not longer stay with a leg in europe and with one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family including through marriages of convenience.
however, we must separate the these people's imminent issue from the long-term problem of their integration.
if others have failed in long-term integration does not mean that we must look at them how they are inherent in the mediterranean.
perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come with.
and if there is an intervention in syria, i do not believe, does not mean that the country will be rebuilt overnight and you can take them back.
until solutions arise, we see fortress fortress within europe.
borders have been closed, walls raise, border controls are being introduced into the schengen area.
is the european project at risk?
the european project as such does not, the schengen area as built, yes.
fairly minimal has been built and arranging the rules so that the pressure has been too high on the countries where they put these migrants for the first time.
that is we we moving freely freely there there, but everyone is with his problems.
in the face of such a wave cannot happen, because some countries are not cope.
when there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they do something, but in the long term, great is not changing.
after the attacks in france, we have no much more draconanti-terrorist legislation in the eu than we had last year.
it is a wave of public emotion that is installed in both senses.
and it is so unstable from one week to another that you cannot make the basis of it.
we have a lot of talk, many rebelcorebel statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virili.
and, then, have the dramatic case of the droecned child in turkey and public opinion is being tened.
after public emotion passes,, will come back to the reasons why we created this area, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
this is the real single market.
and i do not think europeans will give up this principle of libertatations.
there will be other rules rules something different.
schengen is now like an animal created in another age and which was not adapted to the situation situation.
romania how has it so played in this crisis?
as a small country, which believes that if it shosogging on the eye and astits its ears, the theme disappearing.
in the face of the reality waves migrant migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say is not no problem by a small country.
that is what we did is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
you are not, you are not at large country level.
large large countries come with solutions for the entire eu, good or bad bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
as poland has been done.
on the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of romanians for schengen will fall very greatly.
president iohannis says it is perhaps good that we have not already entered.
so we are moving from the disperof entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
there is of course, a risk if romania and bulgaria enter schengen for migrants will see us as an alternative route.
this does not mean that it is a reason not stop entering schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
romania will be part of schengen, and schengen will exist, but transformed into the sense where external borders become common responsibility responsibility, will be single rules for the acceptance of migrants, single rules rules deportation for those who do not receive asylum, single rules are single rules for countries regarded as safe.
the ukrainian president said that after russia moved attention to syria to ukraine, no one died.
is there a link between the two seals, a russian game?
russia has frustratfrustrated behaviour of power.
she believes to being great power means incurling americans and europeans.
from this of view, yes, there is a link.
without the military and financial effort of the putin regime, perhaps the assad regime would probably collapsed collapsed long.
and it was good to collapdown before its main opponent was the islamic state.
any two years was a fight between the assad regime and moderate moderate secular and muslim itiitia, supported by the gulf and western countries.
then the islamic state has been up and now we do no know whether we want the assad regime to fall.
russia was able to complicate things but but cannot participate in the solution.
it creates an outbreak of instability and chaos chaos that it cannot close.
but you are only great power if you also have solutions.
the off-side game is just a strategy to win time.
putin is unlikely waiting bids be made,, to press the butons to resolve the situation.
offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can resolve one way or another issues that he also created.
but i do not agree with theories that say these people are eat by an invisible hand.
let us not see a little stronger than it is.
what buton will defend her soon
millions of facebook users have become customed to the " like " button, and now representatives of the social network prepare another other opposite, " dislike. "
on tuesday, mark zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, the new york times reported at blog.
zuckerberg pointed clear that the " dislike " button will rather show a nuof what a user feels feels than just an option.
however, his announcement raised the issue that facebook could become a less friendly place.
zuckerberg noted that he wants to avoid times when someone is posts on his account an important event in life, and someone else will give " dislike. "
users of the network, who has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have have long been asked to have the opportunity express express negative negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
mark zuckerberg also said it is not very comfortable for people to give' like' to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or as of a death of a family member.
" you cannot feel comfortable to dthe like like that post, " the facebook representative pointed out.
the version of a new facebook button has not well welcomed by everyone.
" there is already enough hatred on facebook and the social alisation networks, " afghanistan's atiq haneef commented commented on the new york times facebook page, where the article was posted on the subject.
" i will give' dislike' the' dislike button, " he said.
roger anderson, a microbioist from atlanta, claimed that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on facebook.
debra aho williamson, a social media analyst with emarketer, noted that it is hard to imagine that a single button can pass out a complex range of negative emotions.
moreover, she says, the election campaign is america coming in approaching, and the " dislike " button would create a total disaster.
only 70 refugees went into hungary within 24 hours
hungary accepted only 70 migrants on tuesday, a hand of thousands of comers to its southern border with serbia, government adviser adviser gyorgy bakondi announced.
hungary declared a state of emergency later day in two counties along the border with serbia over the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing and announcing it will build a guarantor at its border with romania, the dpa recalls.
the move has drawn a sharp reaction from serbia.
just yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who who want to seek asylum.
" as you can see, this is totally different, " serbian minister for refugees aleksandar vulin.
before imposing the new immigration legislation, a record record 5,809 migrants entered hungary on sunday, police announced on monday.
also, over 170,000 immigrants from the middle east and africa entered hungary from serbia in 2015.

" the new " county council headquarters is typical to typical.
two builders in insolvency
the massive investment made here in recent years, to move the institution, is to tear down because they have been stopped several times.
two important builders who have worked here went into insolvency during the work.
the county council county council headquarters vasile alecsandri will end up tear down alone.
a year and a half after the consolidation and refunctioning the the building should have been completed, the work has reached reached half.
a last stage in the era of the building consumed last days, when the national dispute settlement council (cncs) rejected a complaint by the firm that voia to assume the contract to complete the technical project for work work be executed.
the initial project was drafted by impex romcatel.
after the insolvency of the builactor and disruption of business, negotiation procedures were launched without publication of an announcement with impex romcatel, with the firm expected to update the technical project, and then a new tender for works will be held.
" but the negotiations were not completed through a contract, with cj assessing that the proposed form would have put the disadvantaged, " razvan timofciuc, who represented public relations at the cj.
the cj's decision to halt direct negotiations was been attacked in court by impex romcatel.
the emerging court sent the complaint to the cnsc, which has rejected it as a tardiva.
however, this does not mean that the cj can start searching for another design.
impex romcatel has the possibility to attack the cnsc decision at the appeals court appeals, only after its final ruling could be considered into finding another planant.
thus, work to build up the building could resume at early as next year.
our intention is to restart the work as soon as possible.
in principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we need to come to conclude a contract.
" we expect to see whether the decision sc the cncs will be attacked or not, " timofciuc said.

work has been done so far by about 50%.
initially, consolidation work, re-operation and manmanitation of the building had been evaluated at 7.7 million lions.

after the experience experienced neither neither my wife no longer want to calcaller in your city.
without wishing,, they hit met the wrong information from the rent, the lack of the bad controllers and, bonus, by a fine' as so called the law'.

bad for the violists in vasvessel.
they had accident and remained in preventive arrest
the trial of the seven vasla raprapes moved yesterday to the iasi court of court.
emerging judges tried the first term of trial at an non-public meeting where seven seven young accused of beating aging an 18-year young old asked for be at large.
before the actual start of the trial sitting, one of the emerging judges who had assigned the file, viorel munteanu, formulated a request for abstabstention, which was admitted by his colleagues at court.
the magiate activated until summer year year at the vasvastribunal, where he was the president of the nale sec, who, on april 9th, admitted a complaint lodgforward by four of the indictees, disthem placing them in house arrest.
currently, the dossier is tried by a complete of which the marmagistrates of mythtelical and reckthought.
earlier, on the file issued a abstention and judge dan an ton, on the grounds that his daughter was in a relationship to wedating with one of the violists' lawyers.
the two judges decided violviolin the vassa to remain under preventive arrest.
the nti will remain imprisoned for at least 30 more days, when juby writers rediscuss the possibility of them at large.
the term trial judge will take place at the iasi appeals court on 6 october.
before reaching to iasi iasi appeals court, the duba with carrying violviolists in vassa was involved in an accident in neighbourhood neighbourhood pacwishes, the car spread in iasi on the belt.
autoutilitara iveco with whom the seven violists had hit a car volks wagen who travelled from the dela dela sing, and the driver tried to reach the left.
duduwalmoves from the end of sinwishes.
the car entered in iasi iasi because prison administration employees employees preferred the route from vassa to iasi as to the raids, then then on the bypass road.
they thus shortened the road by a few kilometres.

great migrations
romania is not nor will it be ready for what to follow.
but europe?
i say it from the outset, clearly and clear: the no 7000 refugees that they should and should naturalise romania are, in itself, an insignificant significant, but huge number compared comparison romanian state's ability to manage such a project.
for romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by bucharest, amounting tune around around 1,500 soul, it far far beyond our good intentions of solidarity with the european union expressed in recent months.
certainly, if those migrants really accept to settle in our towns, the chances of quickly integrating them quickly into romanian society are extraordinarily low.
i am convinced they will be be first first to lose patience.
parazsed by interlopi and paralysed by a venal political class, the romanian state is proving proving bored in all areas.
the inability to integrate the gyties is just a trivial example.
apart from this, governments of any colohave not been able to absorb european funds, make roads, kindery or modern schools, to ensure decent healthcare, to tighten up the stakes on the streets, to create honourable paid paid jobs or preserve their own young generation at home.
why would refugees be established in another country they are fleeing?
but what produces causing many wonder is particularly the hypocrisy that is dealt with with such a crisis.
we first loarmed of the rebelcoite faclion of the powerful states of the eu which show maximum generosity when it to sharing the troubles with smaller countries.
it then comes the fricold hypocrisy of romanians who who, although millions of relatives dispercattered throughout the the world, do not yet accept other other - from other language, from another religion, another blood.
probably for fear of not steure them carecareor the national being.
finally, there is also hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although invocite the horrors of war as a reason of departure, does not accept any other destination of exodus than only than germany or the northern countries.
or, not all refugees are syrians, and there is not war in pakistan.
also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analysed can only be taken into herded.
the causes must be eliminated, some support and, by strictly strictly on the book of political correctness, call for peace and investment for the migrants' countries of origin.
but in romania there is peace and even enters, from time, something foreign capital into the national economy - but this does not prevent the tens of thousands of romanians from leaving their country every year.
why are leaving?
in this crisis, the european union has been revealed to us that an anchilous, disbroken and outdated construction by the situation.
we deplore the fact that romania is not able to invent a country country project, but that is that the eu does have any plan for the future.
and makimprovisation and threats do not help anything.
then, what is the eu use, if the only advantage that romanians enjoy - the right to freedom of movement - could be called into account of waves refugee refugees that cross borders as via cheese?
at some point, the war in syria will end.
no, not the migrant crisis, however.
over the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, depletion etion resources resources etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from asia and, particular, from africa, towards a better life.
with such politicians, romania is nor will ever be ready for what to follow.

exclusively: a meeting that ruoff your heart.
20 years he received received a courageous gift: biological parents
lost in hospital under unclear conditions, in denial the the 1990s when it had only two months of life, ssick and helpless, and then then adopted by an wealthy family in italy, in the same years when adoption was vague regulated, a young woman was, now a girl, now a blonda and beautiful girl, met the day before yesterday in iasi in a village.
crina will implfor 20 years these days, and her foster parents in palermo thought thought to give their daughter son ving a staggering ing and courageous gift: a visit to romania, to iasi, to know their unclear past.
the " iasi newspaper, " " which witnessed efforts to search for family of family after some extremely vague signs, has witnessed these meetings that basically basically break your heart.
reports to reporters, emotions, statements by those involved, their reactions are of right appalling and overwhelming.
the crine's story story starts 20 years ago in ruginresort, when it was only two months ago.
then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to hospital to the city.
at home, there was mismisunderstanding between the parents, and the mother had to go home.
he decided to keep girl and me to send me from home.
he has stopped front, and then i have not known anything more.
" when i learned that he was in hospital, it was too late, " rereued alina alina, the biological mother of the girl.
crina was admitted together with her grandmother at the pascani municipal hospital, and also then the girl's father, costica balcan left to work the town of alexandria, teleorman county.
their lives had to be completely apart.
they haven't find crina at hospital
after internboarding, the crine's father left for the work in another quality and returned to six months later.
meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in iasi, and the father when he returned, did not found it.
i think they had had passing nearly nine months since the girl was in hospital.
" i thought it she was being abandoned, " tells aches an family grand.
due to financial problems, grandica could not come with crcrina the iasi, and girl girl remained in the care of doctors.
because no one more interested in the fate of the child all this time, it was assumed by the general directorate of social assistance and protection of iasi child, who then gave it to the placement centre in bucium.
there were years when abandonment and adoption were more ily regulated from romania in romania.
at the bucium centre was found by italy's salvadore and his wife, a couple couple palpalermo who wanted to have their child but did failed not succeed.
they fell in love instead with blonduta crina, and a some time, it had to move with them to italy.
the little already had for nearly two years, while it took adoption formalities.
when we saw crina, i felt it was before us.
" as if my wife gave him his life, " he us smilsmiling salvbush, the adoptive father, while he in the palm of the son hands of the girl.
in the country, crine's parents, alina and costica, continued the search separately, each each where it could.
the father asked the ruginous authorities, but he received no answer where his child could be.
police then told them that it could be dead, but in iasi assy parents parents learned what really happened before them.
when i sought it here, they told me to the court he was travelled to italy, to palermo.
and conditions to bail it it had no had.
we asked us to god to be good.
i thought about it in all the years to passed, but there were no possibilities to humilike, to find it.
" it is hard, " it tells aches us ears in the eye the biological mother of the drc.
but, even if the years passed, the rugsty parents have not been forgotten.
in italy, salvadore and wife wife explained to the girl where comes comes and that her past links it with romania.
i was small when i learned.
i think that we had five or six years.
i reacted as a copla, i was curcurious.
" i wanted to know my parents in romania, " i confess happy crina.
and her dream was to become a reality.
in march this year, chief commissioner romica ichim, director of the regional centre for prevention prevention assessment anti drug counadvice, was contacted by an knowledge from italy, who explained salvadore's desire to find the drc's biological family.
and the search started only from a name.
after the request we had from our partners in italy, we began the first steps.
we had only got a name, balcan costica, location, rugily.
shortly short, i had an work with city hall there, and i could ask whether there was as the name received.
then they gave me a few indications, only that the person found was not the wanted.
" it took until last for about a month ago to find the biological father of the girl etet " chief commissioner romica ichim explained to us.
in all, more than three months have taken the authorities to find costicostiand alina alina, especially that each had been domictered in another quality.
we began steps somewhere in march, and in june-july we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
" then we established that a first meeting would place in september, " romica ichim added.
at the weekend that passed, alina and costisaw for the first time they lost at the sites of the iasi hospital hospital 20 years ago.
the father, emosed, could barely master his tears, and his hands have ccrudown.
it is barely changing a few words with those around.
a week before the meeting, could could even sleep.
he was increasingly emotional, treening.
" to see your child after so so many years, it is something, " tells us an grand, she also the costiar from the rugous.
crine's meeting with mother and biological brother
in talks with him, who is expected to study at a well-italian university, costica balcan told, among other things, that if once wants to return to him in the village, to come quiet: he can give him some sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village in the the village and incle a household.
the mother is also emo, complains, and she believes believes this can happen to them.
i am very emotional.
i did not believe that this could happen.
i have seen such cases on television, i have all thinking in these years, had hoped, but i did not think that i could be the case.
they are great emotions.
if they forgive me.
i hope we will visit in the future.
" i hope we are able to maintain a link " " tells great tears to dark alina, the mother of the cr, while keeping closely a servservetservin hand.
in he is hiding hiding his tears, thankhappiness, because he will soon be seen with them after so kind long time.
on the other side, the crina, which will in only a few days, this month, 20, is trying to reassure itself such as an emotional child.
he does not know what to expect, but he skched a vague idea of her biological parents.
he believes they are young people, but now before the meeting they is trying to gather their thoughts because he has a great deal to say but nothing to reproreproach.
my parents are two mothers and two fathers.
but my parents are ultimately the those who have increased me.
it will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
" i hope i have a beautiful memory with them, because there is so so much to say, " i confess.
first family meeting in iasi
in the unifying market, under the skies of autumn autumn, the ruginous family once again uniting their destiny with front of them in palermo.
crina now has 20 years ago, ends the high school, following the italian school model, but can begin a new chapter with alina and costica, her biological parents.
they longer divide them borders or countries, but only a barrier: that of language.
above which, by help of an translator, an local owner at the centre asmine, have easily passed.
those who have managed to make this meeting possible that this is the first event of this kind done, and that in future, the opportunity arises, they will do so.
it is the first event of this kind, such emotional cargo, and i am pleased to be a success.
we at the centre have different activities, and we are often often associated as an institution that deals only with consumer people, drug addicdependent.
but we are trying to restore society society something good back.
" if i have requested for such a evenff, i will do it with great dear, " says smiling romica ichim, director director of iasi regional centre for prevention, iasi anti drug drug assessment counselling.
behind it, the balcan family, crines in the middle, drithemselves themselves themselves.
i am understandable: they have a lot to tell each other.

everyone is drawing ling its soul
camps in the psd's emerging branch ended ended a truce on the leg.

emerging judge refused rapraprapists' file over competition
the seven young people the convicted vasani county of rape arrive arrive to the iasi appeals court.
vasluyans sentenced to sentences between five years to eight months and eight years and four months today present their arguments for putting at freedom, after the court of fund, the judge of vassa, established their imprisonment immediately after ruling encing the ruling.
the file was registered at the appeals court late last week, magiate dan anton anton formulating a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
anton anton cited that one of the defendants' lawyers, the lawyer bogdan luca, is his daughter's rival, lawyer dana anton.
luca ca defending silviu ovidiu burada, the one who received the highest sentence in this dossier.
as motivated judges ruling ruling
late last week, the magistrmagistrate judge vasvasle who convicted seven young people motivated the sentence.
in motiv, the judge talks about the deant reaction of defendants, but also of those who supported them, pointing out that such attitudes create a strong feeling of indignation among public opinion.
" the court finds that after the preventive placement of judicial control, a restrictive freedom but not deprived of freedom, under the impact of the attitude of defendants, families families and local supporters, was felt at the local and national community, a strong feeling of strong feeling of indignation indignation that the accused that people accused of serious facts are being tried a less restrictive measure, " said the motivthe judgment of the vasvessel.
also, magistrates also dismantled the main defence of the seven indictees who during during the cited that the girl they raped would not be " the door of church. "
" the undercourt states that is irrelevant the moral quality of the injured person, something aspect the defendants wanted to highlight through the apparatus they have formulated, given since the physical and sexual freedom of a person person cannot be violated under any pretext, " also reads in motivation.
corbyn, brexit and future of europe
for economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past decades cannot continue on the same in the coming years.
until saturday, little world had knew in romania who jeremy corbyn was.
even today, after he became the new leader of uk labour party, many wonder to what extent can affect our election of a politician who who, after all, not in a decision-position.
jeremy corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of labour post after the war.
marxist said, anti-monarchist (once time asked tony blair then the prime minister, to pull the royal family out of of buckingking palace), a feroamerican anti and sympathisisof vladimir putin (he was otherwise regularly invited to comment on political events by the television the television channel " russia today "), and of hizbollah and hamas.
for corbyn, who at the time considered the murder of osama bin laden as a real tragedy, was almost almost preferred to the united states.
on the model of all the populist demagogues, corbyn has, of course, aculous anti-austerity solutions.
things of the kind that he said and promised and tsipras in greece until he made the market with the real world and economic ties.
the economic programme of the new labour leader provides, among others, massive renationalisation and printing printing money as a solution to financing development projects and to cover very genergenerous social benefits.
certainly, some might ask wondering why the solution to printing money money not not unanimously adopted on the globe, we would then have overall global prosperity! but who would still prevent itself itself from such details.
of course we can also charge bankers blood the bankers, become a kind of service enemies of of left left, but as it has been seen so many times in the past, not only in former communist states or ecuador or venezuela, but in france, at beginning of the mandates of mitterand and hollande.
the additional sums are quickly swded by generous promises, without cover, made by populist demagogues.
as margmargaret thatcher's attention rightly attractive, " the problem of socialism is that at some point, others' money is over. "
few give jeremy corbyn's real chance to reach the prime minister.
in the early 1980s another radical left-wing leader, michael foot, who was not as extremely in conviction that the new leader's leader, failed failed lamentably in the elections.
and then there is still in the uk a workers' class, in the classic sense of the word, a relatively consistent structured structured.
and the unions were sensitive sensitive more influential as they now.
in view of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant as the labour workforce, and extensive automatiations have made the industry a massive need of high-qualified working hand, corbyn's rhetoric has limited appeal.
but, even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
in his latest financial times number believes the election election corcorbyn increases the bre's chances, britain's exit from the eu.
the new labour leader has been a consistent opponent of union membership.
in the eyes of the radical radical left brussels is agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed austerity of the poor.
when combining this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, anti-immigration rhetoric and look look to the refugee crisis that is shaken king the foundations foundations of the eu arrive reaching an explosive mix.
and not just for britain.
but if the british decide decide after the referendum which should be place by 2017, to leave the union loss loss symbolic capital for the entire european project and the deep winds created inside it by euro crisis and now now that of refugees, between north and south, between east and the west, leaving room for room for scenarios scenarios the most most worrying.
all the more because for a whole number of member states, london was a counterapping on the franco-german axis (in which berlin in any, is increasingly becoming the dominant actor).
it is true, british business, city, are strong lawyers for the country's stay in the eu.
but today's europe is no longer that of the past.
there are many resententment, which are growing increasing intensity intensity in very these weeks.
the problem is that brussels, we just recently had a stra in the speech by jean clude junker, increasingly inclined to take major major decisions above the head of the vast majority of the member states by consulting with only a few european powers, mainly with germany.
and this is a time when electoral support for the anti-system system, anti-immigration formthat are at the the euroeurosceptic is increasing dramatically throughout the continent.
in other words, the emotional climate with negative charged has reached reached higher than ever in the past.
hence and the conclusion that the financial times when assassessing the bre's chances.
the pro-eu option is based on a cold calculation that moves from the national interest.
if voters make a cerebral decision, then britain will remain in the eu.
but corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
or, eastern europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
especially if, as is expected, we will see seeing greater integration of the euro area, which will push most of countries in the region and to the peripheriry of interest and of the process of decision in europe.
corbyn, tsipras and syriza in greece, podemos in spain, even bernie sanders in the united states is feeding elling populist rhetoric rhetoric from the frustrations that have accumulated in the osocidental societies.
for economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past decades, generous social benefits, cannot continue continue the same in the coming years.
under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the eurozone - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that have only taken account only integrationist political ambitions, not not the capacity and availability of the peoples and governments of europe to meet such challenges, turbulence on the continent, have taken account, internal tensions in the eu will increase in intensity and seriously affect the situation of romania.
and it is difficult to rule something point in view of possible scenarios.
the question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with with such complicated situations.
constantin brancusi, the god of taran.
rockefeller: " how can i help? "
brancusi: " takes and mature the workshop! "
the great sculptor had a big dream: to be someone, to reach the famous, to hear about him around the world.
behind his famous, however, however something something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered us, retcipes for success in life.
that also has a name.
it is called' truda'.
what to write about constantin brancusi?
what is to say, in fact?
his figure appeared on notes.
and recently, a known bank of romania hired an actor to plays him in a advertising client.
bransi produces and supplies money nearly 60 years since it is not among us.
in romania, there are hundreds of streets and bulevards ards that are bearing their name.
indeed, even the author author of this text lives on one of these streets.
and, when it stands out with odly, you hear the following instructions:' we are going to the park, cheese cheese'.
the country is aboned by its statues.
there are few romanian figures whose works is known known so the world, from children, to the elderly.
brancusi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
neither the communists managed to exrof romania's memory and culture.
his quotations today pane the internet, by receiving hundreds of thousands of like like and share.
and, then, again, what would be said, to writing about this man?
viewed from the lot of books and articles that are trying to reconstitute its destiny, brancu's life seems almost fantuntain, totally unlikely.
you know, there are those people who tell you that if you had had the luck to born in any large city and in a family as much as well is wealthy, your chances of success in your life are almost null.
brancusi's life is the perfect contrast.
and it would be a key here.
perhaps the forthcoming text should be start from here.
with a sentence, however detestable they are.
you forget the creative success stories, which are delivered to you every day to newspapers newspapers tv television.
look very look at this man's figure.
do you want to know how it succeeded in life, how, today, he has heard a whole world?
it is simple.
he has worked every life to be someone.
that is it did.
constantin brancusi is born born 19 february february 1876, in hobita, a small fish fish common village, gorj county, at the of of carians.

by millennia, people people, happy, headed a patriarchal life.
everything tranall down from one anotime to another.
and do you know why things have changed?
civilisation civilisation of great great city has to us.
however, brancusi's childhood was far from idillic.
one of the time in these receiving years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that have characterised the future sculptor years in their home location.
the time is reproduced in the work " cheese. a biography " written by alexandru buican.

and, while the ustustty of the coups, small cheese and has revelation that the world can also be viewed from another perspective, and that the things around can be be toppled.
especially the position of the sun, different from the well known, makes him wonder, as he had to recognise in old age, if the very astritself participates in his order.
should it have been the sun as shocked as his father of what had happened?
the city is currently not functioning
a mp calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
independent deputy viorel blajut called on the psd and the pnl to stop internal fighting and refocus their agenda to the electorate.
what we now see on our political scene is a great disdivide and that.
we have seen nothing of the usl projects in 2012 that will continue.
neither the highway nor the urgent regional hospital, see see how politicians dispute their possible location depending to real estate interests.
let us leave a little political aside, come together and talk.
at present, the city is not working.
" if you are dealing with the internal war, you have no time for those who elected you, " blajut ut.
he assessed that the current political class has disappointed emerging voters, which to be a very low presence in the upcoming local elections around around 30%, effectively representing representing the parties' faithful electorate.
the member also believes that voters will also turn to traditional parties, expressing voicing reservations for new political initiatives such as the " for iasi iasi " party to be launched today.
local parties have very little chances, and will only break ruout from the right's electorate, not the psd psd.
such parties are based on civic active people, who usually usually on the right.

i do not want, but we can cannot go on the way.
" if people voted to us, doesn not mean they are stupid nonsense to vote if i see nothing, " said blajut, who assessed that the main reason why the electorate no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of alals.
a colleague from tatarasi said he he not get his money and had to go by bus.
let us not be hypocritical hypocritical.
there is no little money.
sometimes i am ashamed to raise the money from the caam.
at the end of the mandate i will make a report with everything i have spent, apart from the salaries of cabinet employees and its maintenance.
i happened to raise in one month and 3000 l, with all the transport accounts, accommodation and the others.
" to say a mp that he does not get his money is clean hypocrisy, " ended blajut.
