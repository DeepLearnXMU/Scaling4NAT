un chief says no military solutions in syria
secretary-general ban ki-moon says his response to russia's military support for syria is that " there is no military solution " to the conflict that has been going on for almost five years, and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
the un chief again called on all parties, including the divided un security council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
ban said at a conference this month that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent countries present in the council-us, russia, china, england and france -- on the sidelines of the general assembly's ministerial session to discuss syria.
ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the syrian people and regional powers " have made this situation untouable. "
ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on iran's nuclear weapons, addressing the syrian crisis.
8 poll figures showing donald trump has real chance
some tried to label him as a " flip-flop " politician.
others have called him a joke.
and others are waiting for imploia.
but no of how some republicans are trying to tear st donald trump from the poll top, they has not worked (yet).
ten of the past 11 national polls have shown that donald trump leads by two two figures, and some are beginning to ask themselves what this means for the chances of real estate mogul's being appointment.
of course, it is still premature.
none of this says that trumtrump will win the race to nominate the republicans.
pundits shows that during the same period in 2011, rick perry's advance was way to herman cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
and the reasons why it would fight hard in the general elections are many.
but outside groups such as jeb bush's super cap and the economic conservative club for growth acknowledge the trump's power and are beginning to support it with money.
we still presenting to you some figures in recent polls suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just something notpassing:
figures indicating support for trump have returned to 180 degrees.
even before donald trump announced its candidacy in mid-june, a survey by the university of monmouth shows that only two out of 10 republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
by mid-july, the percentage climup to 40%.
in early august, it was 52 per cent.
currently, six out of 10 republicans have a favourable view of donald trump.
about three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
these figures remain.
a poll conducted last week by quinnipiac in iowowconcluded that 60% of the region's republicans have a favourable view of the trump.
two-thirds of gop voters would be happy if trump won the race for the nomination.
in a poll by cnn / orc last week, 67% of the republicans said they would be " excited " or " satisfied " if trump won the race for the nomination.
only two out of 10 say they would be " upset " if the trump won the race for the nomination.
only ben carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as trump (43% says he would be " excited " about 40% who say the same about trump).
closest in terms of enthusiasm?
marco rubio, with only 21%.
on the other hand, 47% of republican voters say they would be " dissatisfied " or " upset " if favorfavourite jeb bush wins the race for the nomination.
most republicans do not see trump's temperas a problem.
although donald trump has been strongly criticised for insinsults and bombastic style, 52% of nationwide republican voters consider the real estate mogul to have the right temperature to be president, according to a poll conducted by abc news / washington post on monday.
we find the same figures in iowa, where also 52% of the republicans believe the trump has the right personality to be leader, according to a poll conducted by quinnipiac last week.
however, 44% believe it does not have the personality to act effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperature has no place at the white house, according to the abc / post.
republican voters are getting used to the idea.
when taking the stance of intellectuals, republican voters consider the trump authentic.
according to a poll by cnn / orc last week, on the question of who has the best chance of winning the race for nomination gop, four out of 10 said trump.
the situation has changed since the end of july, when four out of 10 parbet on jeb bush.
full information: in the past, gop voters have not read the future very well.
during the same period in the last elections, four out of 10 republicans elected rick perry in the race his nomination, compared to only 28% for mitt romney.
but these figures show that the majority of gop voters consider trumtrump's campaign plausible.
even though his republicans grirant to another candidate candidate; trump still leads everyone.
some say the divided situation is likely to contribute to trump's victory, while support against trump will split to more than a dozen candidates.
but a poll in early september by the university of monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of collaboration between trump and most other republican candidates, almost always trump will receive majority support.
trump is 13 points away from carly fiorina on 14 points from marco rubio, 15 points from walker, at 19 points of jeb bush and, finally, 33 points each compared to average paul, john kasich and chris christie.
it is close on an equal with ted cruz.
the only candidate to defeat him?
ben carson would beat the businessman 19 points in a hypothetical one of one to one confrontation.
most supporters of donald trump say they have been decided.
a new poll by cbs / nyt on tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support trump say they are not change their ballots.
obviously, much can happen in this regard, and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say it leaves the door open to the possibility of changing its option.
however, trump's most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon ben carson, but voters who say they decided to vote with trump.
six out of 10 republicans say they agree with the trump on immigration.
since donald trump appointed immigrants from mexico " rapists " in his speech opening his campaign two months ago, immigration has been the central topic in the campaign for 2016.
some worry that trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between key hispanici voters and the republican party and will harm rebranding efforts.
but according to a poll conducted by abc / post monday, six out of 10 republicans say they agree with the trump on immigration.
so it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will the trump doland.
frustration with the authorities is reaching new colours.
donald trump and ben carson are now supported by nearly half of the republican voters, largely because of their status as outsident.
according to a poll conducted by abc / post monday, six out of 10 republicans say they prefer a political outsider at the expense of someone with government experience.
people are also angry with washington.
a poll two weeks ago in iowa by often moines ad/ bloomberg found that three out of four republicans in iowa are frustrated by the performance of the republican at the congress, with 54% saying they were " dissatisfied " and 21% " nervous in the coloes. "
jeremy corbyn makes debut at prime ministry's contentious
since his election, the start of mr corbyn in pmqs has long awaited.
the new labour party leader, jeremy corbyn, will make his debut at the prime ministry' contentious later, facing david cameron for the first time.
mr corbyn will ask the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after midch; his performance will probably be closely examined by the media and labour meps.
at weekly appearances, he called for " less theatre and more facts. "
he also said he could drop several participation and give in to his colleagues.
the confrontation will be mr corbyn's first parliamentary test in a leading position, coming after appointing a " fanantom cabinet " and following his speech at the annual tuc congress on tuesday.
meanwhile, the leader of the labour party's decision to remain silent at the national anthem's news as of a service held tuesday on the 75th anniversary of the battle of england has drew criticism from conservative mps and kept front headlines.
mr corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
a spokesman for mr corbyn said that he has remained silent respectfully' and acknowledged the' heroism of british air forces in the battle of england'.
but a member of mr corbyn's phantom cabinet, owen smith, said for programme two's newsnight by the bbc that it would have recommended that the labour leader to play the national anthem' regardless of' of his belief that monarchy should be abolished.
around a dozen ministers in the fananma cabinet refused to be part of mr corbyn's leading team, arguing with differences of opinion on the economy, defence and foreign, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party backed him as a leader.
bbc political correspondent robin brant says political differences " cumulate " in the labour party after mr corbyn's appointment regarding his position towards the eu and the benefit limit.
mr corbyn said at the tuc conference that the labour party will bring about changes that will completely eliminate eliminate the idea of limiting.
a few hours later, mr smith, minister for labour and pensions, said that the party' is very clear' in exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the' cap' level from gbp 26 000 to gbp 23.000.
mr corbyn will be the fifth labour leader david cameron has faced at the gallery in the last decade since he taking over of the conservative party.
the labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas' from external sources' for questions he ask to mr cameron and he has received more than 3 000 suggestions.
parliament member islington north said pmqs involves too high a level of confrontation and would refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
mr corbyn said that angela eagle, the minister for finance, will hold his place in pmqs when he cannot participate - for example, when mr cameron moves abroad.
he also expressed the that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying he had addressed chamber of deputies president john bercow to discuss this issue.
when he took the lead in 2005, mr cameron said that he wanted to give up the' punch and judy' political style often associated with pmqs, but acknowledged several years later that he had failed to do so.
since the first transmission in 1990, pmqs has been seen as a key barometer of the rationof a leader, the way he heads the chamber of deputies and his position among my fellow lawmakers, although critics say it has become a caricature and he needs profound reform.

jd sports chief says higher salaries could harm enlargement
jd sports president peter cowgill says an increase in the minimum wage in britain could mean " greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers. "
but that purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher costs for the workforce within the firm, he says.
the costs could impact on the enlargement plans of jd sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
thanasi kokkinakis backed by tennis australia president steve enciy
thanasi kokkinakis would deserve praise and not criticised for his behaviour.
thanasi kokkinakis was as a collateral victim in the " storm " created around his friend nick kyrgios, and his behaviour rather deserves words of praise rather than criticism, in the opinion of tennis australia president steve santy.
kokkinakis, the youngest part of the talented duo often named " special ks, " has been unplantly dragged into the spotlight spotlight the the scandalous derapage kyrgios had towards stan wawrinka at the montreal masters tournament.
in a ffly qualification match played shortly after, in five years, the seat referee had to intervene twice to break separated kokkinakis and his opponent ryan harrison, after which harrison said, " wawrinka should have put kyrgios to ground, and should have put chicbotland.
although it was last seen as a dust rocket after carrying muscular crick and missed a possible us open tournament, angby richard gasquet, kokkinakis was firmly defended by enciy.
the teener is currently in glasgow, where he vies with sam groth for second place individually after bernard tomic in the davis cup semifinal against england.
" one thing i feel strong is that in my opinion, asi has been attracted a little into the conflict, " santy said.
the truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because accusing the crampe in us, but he is not the first player to break a rocket from frustration over himself, and i know thanasi well enough to know he would not be proud of it.
but let us be serious, it has perdled very very well in rather challenging situations in us with harrison and so on, and i think it deserves a lot of trust.
it has an extraordinary team, it has a great family together and i think it has been unfairly treated.
he is a 19-year-old very mature, is working hard and integrated into the team, has had no conflict with the other players, is highly respected in the west, he trains, he is in an excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young man, i think he deserves to be tried solely on the basis of his qualities and defects.
ány also backed the decision not to consider consider kyrgios for the key stakes match, begins on friday, and described the " joint decision " as the most appropriate for all, but advocated the return of the long long-@-@ term player to the team.
" first, we want the team to focus entirely on the stakes match and not to think at all about the controversy surrounding [kyrgios], " asmy said.
and i think nick moved up very quickly, as people like federer and murray said, he is maturing under the public's eyes and made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticised, but we are trying to support him, are trying to help him understand the consequences of his facts and i think he needs needs time reflect, good both for the team and for him.
2016 elections: hillary clinton's advantage over bernie sanders has narrowed halin in national polls
former secretary of state hillary clinton still has a two-figure lead in the democratic race for national candidacy, but senator bernie sanders is gaining ground.
clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
vice-president joe biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is backed by 15% of democratic voters.
at least five months before the start of primary elections, the majority of democratic voters say it is too early to say they had been decided on the candidate they will support.
but clinton's supporters are firmer in their election than supporters of other candidates.
compared to cbs news poll last month, clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while sanders won several per cent.
clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has narrowed.
support among men has been reduced considerably and sanders are only 5 points away.
clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now on an par with sanders.
however, clinton still leads the lead among older voters.
last month, clinton was outside sanders, with two figures, among liberals, but sanders now has a slight 5-point advantage in the group.
about half of the democratic voters at the nationwide say they would enthusiastically support clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
a quarter would support it somewhat reserved, and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
six per cent would not support it.
perhaps unfun, the likelihood of clinton's current supporters being enthusiastic about her election is high.
opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
while 48% of democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support clinton, the number of republican voters who say the same about first, donald trump (35%) is lower.
when supporters of clinton are asked an open question as to why they would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has adequate experience (16%), followed by by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the post (10%).
clinton's supporters also mention her association with bill clinton (9%).
the agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
with the vice-president considering possible presidential candidacy, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him in the race -- although one third believe they should not run.
to the question of the second option for the party representative, democratic voters majority call biden.
of clinton's supporters, more than half say biden would be the second option, well ahead of sanders.
if biden decides not to run in the democratic party race, hillary clinton's advantage over sanders increases, from 20 points with biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of democratic voters consider clinton the best likely candidate of winning the general elections; but the figures dropped from 78% last month.
biden is second away, however, the percentage it is most eligible has increased.
however, when asked what is most important for an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer issues instead of eligibility.
as last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well in terms of several key characteristics towards their party's primary voters.
most voters see clinton, sanders and biden as integrated and reliable and with solid leaders.
biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity, while clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not believe h. clinton is integrated and reliable, twice as many as those who say so about sanders (15%), but 27% have no opinion on it.
democratic voters also generally believe the three, clinton, sanders and biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
on all these issues, about a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion of sanders.
as the questions persist over the use of a personal address email address and a server by hillary clinton when she was secretary of state, the majority of democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject and say she did not affect their general opinion on the candidate.
but things are different among the us public.
half of the americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
public opinion was divided in march on the subject, shortly after the issue came to light.
most americans say the controversy over the email has not affected their general view on clinton, although 36 per cent say they have changed their opinion negatively.
mainly the republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their opinion on clinton on the negative sense.
although democratic voters believe clinton integrate and reliable, this issue continues to raise her problems among voters generally: only 32% consider it integrate and reliable, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in may.
62% of voters do not see it integrated and reliable.
at the same time, 55% of voters nationwide nationwide do not regard trump integrate and worthy of trust.
however, both clinton and trump have white boxes for leadership.
of the six assessed candidates, biden, carson and bush rank first in terms of integrity.
the number of those considering sanders integrru is higher than those who do not agree but, as with carson's case, many do not have an opinion of him.
the margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
five indictment indicted with 1 murder of student at baruch faculty
nearly two years after a university student lost his life during a initiating ritual in the pocono mountains in pennsylvania, five people were charged with the murder.
members of the pi delta psi brotherhood at new york-based baruch faculty brutally attacked chun " michael " deng during a initiation ritual in september 2013 and postponed taking him to hospital, contributing to his death, according police said.
official sources say the victim was tied to the eye, was put with a 14kg of sandsandrurubehind behind and has been bulbled repeatedly while trying to move towards a target on frozen field.
mr deng accused headaches before losing his knowledge.
members of the pi delta psi brotherhood did not call the emergency number after it faded and claim to waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.
but they found the time needed to change deng's clothes, look for its symptoms for google and contact the national brotherhood, president andy meng to ask him for advice, police chief chris wagner said at a press conference.
" at this point, members started hiding personal goods and practically put the good of the brotherhood before michael deng's good, " wagner said.
it could not be rerecitated and it the next day in the morning.
according to an autopsy report, deng suffered repeated traumas in the head, saits and coapse.
" too many families have been devastated by the brothers rituals in 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals, " douglas boberg, lawyer for deng's family, said in a statement.
frts and their members must be held accountable, and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
monroe district's great jury recommended that the first five members be charged with three-degree crime.
thirty-two other medes of the brotherhood, including mr meng, will also be indicted for ultraj and complicity in the murder.
" we want to hold to account not only the persons involved but, if there is an organisation that has the brotherhood, officially or informally, we will also hold it to account, " wagner said at a press conference tuesday.
the baruch faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representative.
that is what will happen when the federal reserve increases interest rates.
interest rates will rise and bull market (growing market) will ticter, bond' profitability will increase and the economy recession recession.
that is what we know.
what we do not know is how long it will happen and how long it will take.
in the economy, history offers few indications of employment.
after the first increase would interest rates, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
the aggression of the federal reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
that is why officials from the us central bank have emphasised so strongly that investors should not focus on when interest rates begin to rise, but on the trajectof the time needed for normalisation.
indeed, there are many variables at stake.
but in the end, market players might see that all the stir over the interest rate rates has been exaggerated.
" the first interest rate increase decided by the edf after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the era of " cheap money, " julian jessop, chief economist at capital economics, said in a note to customers.
on the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of us interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear of.
however, it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
we are still presenting how some sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
given the situation that the market has experienced in recent months, the ation of an interest rate increase can volatile volatile things for some time.
however, at the time is rising, the impact is not so dramatic.
" it seems that there is a tendency that the profitability of capital will stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which perhaps again reflects the breakdown in monetary policy, " deutsche bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after edf increases.
specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by around 14% - moving towards increasing the interest rate, quite invariable over the period 250 days after (the average climation of 2.6%) before returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on barron by head actor of nuveveen management.
deutsche said the impact on actions tends to become pronounced later in an interest rate increase cycle and the benefits are beginning to fall.
the recession is a reality of economic life, but increasing the interest rate often contributes to it.
in the current situation, the edf is facing some conditions that did not exist before and which could speed up a recession.
specifically, gross domestic product will move closer to its historic minimum point for an increase in the edf interest rate.
according to deutsche bank, out the 118 interest rate increases after 1950, only twice roll roll call gdp was less than 4.5%.
even though in the second quarter of 2015, value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to continue, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the edf atlanta.
increasing the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could the question question " whether this time it is different, " deutsche said.
market players have also prepared their year for an growth decision from the edf, with all eyes focused at this week's meeting of the federal open market commission, which ends on thursday.
although many strategists and economists believe the fomc could approve an increase in interest rates at the meeting ,-@-@ term transactions indicate only 25% likely.
" in our study after 1950, all cycles for increasing interest rates to date have been in a super profit profit growth cycle, with gdp eclipishing varvarties before the recession very quickly after the recovery began, " the report said.
on the contrary, this has been a strange recovery of slow since the worst recession in consideration.
the current cycle is by far the longest expected by the edf since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months and it has reached 74 months and continues.
fixed income has also been volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the printing is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
the main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of actions when the edf amendthe policy.
in the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits are changing direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs.
at the end of the cycle of interest rate increase, the profitability of bonds is falling immediately, " deutsche said.
charles schwab strategies believe that these interest rate increases will bring bring profitability between short- and and long-term bonds bringing together, apliling cleanup.
bonds with high profitability are doing better in such an environment, although " we are still cautious of forcing profitability, " kathy jones, a fixed income analyst at schwab, said in an analysis.
interestingly, jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of edf policy.
" besides the power of the dollar and the estimated drop in inflation, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy, " jones wrote.
short-term interest rates have risen, the flow of profitability is fairer, the spreads the average credit interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the edf tightens politics.
by the whole, companies operating in the us us benefit from an increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
the high-debt multinationals will suffer because dollar growth will make their products more expensive in area of the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
" history shows that " quality " stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months after an initial increase in the interest rate, " analyst goldman sachs said in a report to customers.
strong balance balance firms exceeded those with a poor balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, at an average of 5 percentage points.
companies with high capital revenues and low volatility stocks also exceeded companies similar to lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
debt will become an important issue.
companies with a large proportion of fleet debt have the most to lose, goldman says.
consumers will also benefit from the increase of the dollar.
those who save could also benefit, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
bbc radio 3 a copy after fm classic ics, says member andrew bingham
conservative mp andrew bingham criticised radio for " fosing "
he says it is increasingly similar to commercial opponent
he also took the bbc music awards to eye, saying they plmed the brits awards.
colleague damien collins attacked the voice, saying the programme was not original either.
bbc radio 3 " is turning into " fm classic, a senior mp said, putting pressure pressure to prove he is doing something that commercial stations do not do.
conservative mp andrew bingham also told the bbc heads that public radio " prostse " and increasingly resembles the trade sary.
" i have the impression that radio 3 " prostse " -- although i don't like to use the word -- but i have the impression that it is turning into fm classic, " he said.
he also watched the bbc music awards, launched last december.
bbc music awards, launched last year, appear to be brits under another name.
so if you try to do something different -- these are the two examples that come to mind that only copy what already exists on the market, " mr bingham said.
the bbc director general denied the accusations, saying bbc radio 3 is well ahead of his commercial opponent over live music and public education.
i will find out nowhere about the classical music i know from radio 3.
and his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
" moreover, i think the commitment of radio 3 to discover new music and allocation of new parts is also important, " he said.
in the first part of this year, bbc radio 3 editor alan davey said they must do more to draw the audience from the previous period because the british have less knowledge of classical music.
but radio 3 was not the only element under the bbc logo criticised at a meeting of the culture, media and sports committee for going in the follow steps of its trade rivals.
conservative mp damien collins attacked the voice -- the bbc show bought the bbc from dutch producer talpa media for about gbp 22m.
do you understand why there is often discussions about that issue because it is not original and not distinguish itself by anything?
lord hall insisted that the bbc1 show -- with the paloma faith and boy george in juriu -- be carried out " in a specific manner to the bbc. "
he added that he wants the corporation " to find gold egg ken in his own house " next time it launches a entertainment show.
however, he refused to ban in future from taking of new seasons from the voice or spend money going on licenses on other entertainment formforms.
internet sales registered the lowest increase in august, and the culits could be be black ger
in the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
in the past month, there has been the slowlower growth since 2000.
online sales gained momentum three years ago, due to the use of the mobile phone to shopping.
specialists believe that the black ese of november could lead to retireluctance to spend.
for more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned commercial streets of britain into gantom cities.
specialists, however, say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
the total money spent in august showed the lowest growth since 2000, with an increase of only 5 per cent over the past year.
specialists say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
" if we look at the level of growth in previous years and return to 2000, there has always the rationalisation trend over time, " andy mulcahy, editor of the imrg sales index, told guardian.
he explained that online sales gained momentum three years ago, when buyers began using the mobile phone to shopping.
thus, the number of people who could make online purchases increased and do so under various circumstances, such as the sunset set.
but now that it is stagnata little, you could see a decrease (in growth).
the black coming phenomenon, imported from america, is mentioned as one of the reasons for falling sales.
in the specialists' view, buyers would refrain from shopping ahead of the event on the past friday in november.
last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked to front of computers to put their hands on offers, which led to the collapse of several retailers.
specialists believe that black ger, when buyers beat barilibarates, could cause purchaspurchaspers reluctant.
a study by british retail consortium determined that at least 1 associates from every 5 points is spent online.
in the case of certain products, such as televisets and washing cars, more than a third of the purchases are currently being made via online shops.
at the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy online clothes and shoes than to turn to fashion shops in commercial areas.

at the ceremony on the street, hundreds of muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed due a collapsed cranes at the big mosque in mecca.
victims included the father of four children, qaeda sim akram, from bolton, great manchester, in her first pilgrimage when the cranes collapsed.
mr akram is in the big mosque with his parents before the start of hajj pelgrigriage annually.
saudi authorities have already promised that hajj pelgriinage in mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still reaching the city.
today, king salman said the binladin group should not have left the arm of the butal raised when the bloodshed was not in operation.
an arab version of the decree, published by the saudi news agency, said the binladin group partly bears the blame for the collapse.
the news agency's english service did not present the detail, but said the company's leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
earlier this week, salman vowed to reveal what caused the crcral to collapse in the grand mosque, where hundreds of thousands of muslims came before hajj pelgriinning later this month.
the binladin group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the butanes and group group representatives have not be contacted for statements.
the royal decree blamed the group for not using up-to to-date safety measures and not coordinating its work with meteorological authorities.
dozens of cranes surround the great mosque in mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the binladin group.
for decades now, the binladin family has had a close relationship with saudi arabia's royal family and major construction projects been under way.
the latest qqaeda leader osama bin laden was a be " reneged, " disinherited by the family in the 1990s.
the collapse occurred under conditions of strong wind and rain, just days before the arrival of millions of people in the royal to participate in pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the lives of every muslim physically displaced.
authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
the authorities decided that the relatives of the eased victims should receive one million riarabia (gbp 174,000) and the same amount should be paid to those with permanent injuries.
another injured will receive half of that amount.
benefits, disadvantages of credit conversion into swiss francs
two offers for converting credit tulei into swiss francs have already appeared on the banking market, the main benefits being to exclude foreign exchange risk and reduce rates.
the disadvantages can come in a few years' time, when the variable interest can lead to increased rates.
the transylvania bank has just completed the process of credit conversion into francs granted by volksbank, and the bankpost announced a conversion offer for its own customers.
according to data cumulative by analysts from the financial portal finzoom, the bankpost offers three years of fixed interest interest at lei, 1.5%, the lowest in the market.
on the other hand, the transylvania bank's offer for conversion was accepted by 83% of customers with credit in francs due to two successive cuts: the balance has been reduced to the value of risk and administration fees paid by the customer, then an additional reduction of 22.5% to soil applied in lei.
both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to much they paid equivalent every month in lei before conversion.
thus, the transylvania bank reducing the rate by 42.5%, and the bankpost, by 33% in the first three years and theoretically by 18% in the coming years.
benefits
the main advantage of co-delivery in credit tulei in chf is that foreign currency risk is eliminated, with the consumer protected by future frankes increases, and the repayment of credit will be made in the when he collects his salary.
another major advantage of both offers of conversion is that there is no reassessment the property, no additional guarantees and other proof of revenue are required.
in practical terms, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of credit, nor will there be an additional costs as in the event of re-financing.
both banks also offer a reduction in the monthly rate, compared to how much customers paid before conversion, equivalent to the lei.
risks
the problem is that the early years rate is made up more of interest, and the customer rewards very little mainly.
the offer of very low-interest bankpost in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
however, it is unclear how this interest will develop after three years.
the margin for customers can be more than 3.25%, so in total, and the cost reduction is lower.
a possible risk to all credits in variable interest lei is for the robor index to increase significantly in the coming years (more than the libor index - chf).
for example robor every three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached 6% in 2009, at more than 15% and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
in addition, other costs may also arise, not mentioned in their initial offer.
time has come for decisions on the interest rate for the us federal reserve
the world is turning its eyes at a meeting scheduled in two days, wednesday and thursday, when the us federal reserve will make a crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
in a reuters poll with the participation of 80 economists, just over half who last week thought the decision would be made, i now believe the situation would remain for some while and that interest rates would be kept within the current range of 0-0.25%.
this is an historic event because seven years has passed since the federal reserve brought rates to zero.
for the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could abandon up zero rates and initiate a process of normalising interest rates, " said angel ubide, chief analyst at the peterson institute for international economics.
the us economy has evolved relatively well, with recovery bringing usd trillion to the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
however, the federal reserve must not ignore the global situation less rosy.
he warned the markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
the decision will be announced on tuesday, 20: 00 tec.
stars who lose their charming
actor (left), along with his son redmond (right), has experienced stressful situations in recent years.
in 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his life partner, farrah fawcett, in the face of cancer.
it is also rumoured that the actor had faced the problem of drug consumption and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
all of this certainly has a cost.
player luke shaw of manchester united stands on the bar for several months due to double fracts.
luke shaw suffered a double frture on his right leg in a match by manchester united in champions league, which ended with a defeat to psv eindhoven.
after the event that brought tears to the player in the eye and which will keep bara for at least six months, louis van gaal remains optimistic that shaw will be able to play this season again.
the injury occurred following an reckless intervention by héctor moreno in the 15th minute after shaw, 20, broke psv defence.
he received medical care for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
van gaal said, " has a double frture on his leg and is in hospital. "
it will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps the day after tomorrow then operated in manchester.
it is appalling - a boy who came to manchester united when he was 18 years old, has difficulties, then plays fantastic and now this is happening.
in the west, the mask of oxygen was placed.
it complaint.
i am not a doctor, but at the double track t it is six months time and will not play in the group phase.
i hope that it can play this season again.
it seems that moreno has had good luck and has escaped the red card and the signing a coup d penalty.
referee nicola rizzoli has not punish mexican.
van gaal suggested the italian official was wrong.
you can judge alone when i say it is a foul and red card.
it was a very ugly intervention two-leglegintervention.
a message on shaw's twitter account:' thank you all for your messages, i have no words to express how weakened i feel, i am starting the road to recovery, i will come back stronger'.

the england team's defender has an additional reason to recover to play at the european championship in france next june.
phillip cocu, coach psv, said, " it is a very ugly injury. "
everyone is very sad when a player suffers suffers such injury.
our players never seek to accidde an adversary.
moreno broke his leg by playing for mexico's national national against the dutch led by van gaal at the 2014 world championship.
" it is very difficult for him because he did not intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it is a very serious injury, it's not good, " cocu said.
i have not seen the phase.
i only managed to see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [moreno] achieved it but i could not see the intervention on luke.
in his statement on sbs6, moreno said,' i know how it is, i know how difficult it is to pass through this.
i feel bad fopho, i am so sorry.
psv player, andrés guardado, also reached hospital after intervention by chris smpierre.
adam lyth clearly risked the omission of england, but is still kept loud.
victory over pakistan in the united arab emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing england's team selected for the tournament, i do not consider a 3-0 repeat of defeat in the test matches.
i would not eliminate a travel victory either.
alastair cook's team may have less experience than three years ago, but it has good players in side in the batting line and collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events in 2012 but will have a positive attitude to youth.
moremali is evolving as a spinner and adil rashid, even if unknown at the test level, is an option for the attack.
similar topics: adam lyth left england's team for the test matches and replaced by alex hales
obviously, as his chief coach in yorkshire, i find it difficult to look at the decision not to select adam lyth on the team.
he played the seven test matches against two good attacants under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are on trial after the results.
there have been no question marks about joe root, for example, until the announcements have been made because - and i have said so before - the players are their own selected.
a fifty years and perhaps lyth would have extended its run, but its destiny is in its hands.
i hope that if it does more run for yorkshire, it will have other opportunities.
the chief coach of the team of england, treva bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance was not commenate with with his capacity and does not surprise me that; above all, he is a teamman.
it is hard to answer the question as how long a batsman is remarked in test matches.
lyth had seven run -- as did sam robson before him -- while nick compton had nine.
only compton had luck at home and in travel.
the only discontent you can have was that england preferred jonathan trott in the caribbean tour - when lyth was fully form - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
the team comes alex hales, a batsman whom i co-gate very well.
he is a cricket player with the " factor x " and noticed early in yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a pitch trent bridge.
it should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the uae team.
the idea was launched midrow would opening up to beating with cook, which would lead off spinner while keeping four quicks, and i have nothing against it.
i do not see why a dumter could not hit there, and this clumsy player has already shown that he is being ve.
perhaps mosburg did not bring success to his district, worcestershire, but it was no 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
my old colleague of team, justin langer, played his first 38 test matches 38 as first hand before entering the open in 2001.
he immediately deleted three centuries and did not look behind.
zafar ansari comes to the team of back-up spinner and, although i had limited contact with him, it was struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
people could judge early early age -- with an average of 31 per beaten and 35 at the ball -- and think it is punt, but there is no lot of thornights and selected opted for youth.
it will learn a lot from the tournament.
england has also made some changes to the coteam.
the appointment of mahela jayawardene, sri lankan batsman, as a consultant for the test matches could be a blow to master.
he is one of the best players and he will bring a great deal of experience, given that he has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
paul collingwood comes to the tournament white-ball link and will bring both energy and ruthless ambition.
i have always believed he was born to become involved in the international cricket, whether as a player or as coach, and like mahela, has a intude.
sometimes, new voices in the west, even if they send messages that have been sent out before, can bring fresh air to the team.
the teammate of colly durham, ben stokes rest rest for matches on one day, root has received a similar break against australia, and i have no problem with that.
although not all disagree, coaches and selected do not make the programme.
and you must remember, players' jobs depend on the results they achieve.
such decisions are never taken easily.
the brexit camp could prevail if economy remains in the helfl by 2017
every day, the strategy for renegotiating david cameron to keep britain into the eu is getting louder into the incurmess, even without the election of genial jeremy' yes or not?' corbyn at the helm of the labour party or tuc brings serious criticism of europe on tuesday.
foreigners also have figures such as corbyn and nigel farages.
a european diplomat explained to the last days that - sunmerged in crises similar to that in the eu - not all of which are internally - some some member states are fuelled by britain's agenda concessions concessions changes to the treaties, which the most do not want.
in brighton, during the annual meeting, tuc decided that they do not want it either if they eroded social protection.
we could even call it dave and george's " selphy " agenda.
the prime minister and chancellor are attending bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, make a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and say they won allies for reform.
it is only about me.
my european friend, who wants britain with an outward perspective under the roof of the eu -- " do not leave us alone with france, " berlin says -- suggests that several narrow ministers and officials from some capitals have reached the point where they do not care if they stay or leave.
i cautiously german chancellor angela merkel is an ally but has has been the helm for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation shaks, as happened with thatcher (11 years), mitterrand (14) and kohl (16), who have stayed too long.
in 2017, french president françois hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
his power is also in decline.
poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, spain on a left-wing government.
it is hard to believe that they will help the english who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent scotland from leaving of britain - something they do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
thus, some ministers may even plan to make remarks that do not help, in the snp style, in the campaign for the 2017 referendum in britain to speed up the brexit process, my friend suggests.
" renegotiation was fixed " and " britain has got nothing value from renegotiation. "
europeans know on their skin how acering liststreet can be and how sceptical the oligarchic press barons are who view the eu scepticism scepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by tony benn that ratified our 1973 entry into report 2: 1.
perhaps i remember vely of boris johnson, the euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a rescoment of brussels.
ed miliband knew his enemies.
they have included the mixof duty, foreign non-payitors with telephone fraud and pseudo non-domi holding most the important newspapers.
in fact, tony blair sees them rather the same, but he realised that when you are closed in a cule alongside a nervous gorla, you have to give the bananas to distract his attention from the thought of eating at lunch and again at tea.
in fact, miliband was blaired than blair in opposition to cameron's idea of a referendum, as blair made a concession on the principle to the abandoned eu constitution buried by french and dutch voters in 2005, which gave him an exit card.
the media did not forgive him for that either.
but jeremy corbyn, who reached my friendship behind the back at westminster on monday - i told him not to consume his time with me -- seems to be in danger of adopting the murdoch's strategy for boycott neil kinnock from from ou, a mistake then and now.
it may take time, but it must develop a coherent co-operation strategy the media, not with me, but certainly with andrew marr whose position at the bbc left her holiday sunday.
corbyn's official position towards europe is what i would lenily call development.
he says we would like to stay in a reformed eu.
most of those who disagree with conservative' angishness' may agree to that.
that said hilary " a benn, but not a lane " benn at radio and tv this week, when the researcher in him struggled not to recognise that corbyn's appointment of john mcdonnell as minister " in the the shadow " on financial matters was a bad idea.
he reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on tv to be unfair to labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing his post in the cabinet.
hilary's fight has been more attractive.
but the fight to remain " in any situation " -- benn's expression -- does not correspond to what mcdonnell, nor nor to what jc told colleagues and lawmakers at a private meeting monday night.
regardless of the image corbyn wants to convey to - remember, it has also made me awareness aware - the discipline of messages remains important in the television era, and particularly in the variede social networks, a paranoia and treason hotbed.
it is right not to give cameron a' yes' ticket in europe, allowing him to take the good support of labour in the referendum campaign, as mcdonnell said.
simon jenkins certainly believes so.
but the basic sohistry of mcdonnell and corbyregard to eu membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a hesitant discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom small differences narnarciism ism ism is a central dogma.
as with sophihior nato - tom watson is adadamant that the jc will not campaign for abandonation -- foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
why should they waste paris or berlin political capital - and there there are suspicious voters - for concessions towards britain when everything could be pointless?
the us is already quite disappointed about the poor military performance of english in iraq, libya and syria, even with a conservative government that is cutting costs, as i was reminded at the launch of british right security forum on monday.
specialists criticise england's public health department decision on electronic cigarettes
according to researchers, claims by a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of whom with links to the tobacco industry.
specialists from the editorial team of the british medical journal (bmj) joined the lantec in criticising evidence used by the england department of public health (audy) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
the,, published the " reference " report month, described it as a " complex analysis of evidence. "
however researchers, however, have questioned the robustness of data and pointed the finger at links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
an article published in lantec medical magazine last month attacked the " extraordinarily fragile basis " on which the main conclusion founded reporting.
two other researchers writing in bmj questioned the claims and basing them " on solid land or miscator sand. "
martin mckee, professor of european public health at the london school of president and tropical tropical, and simon capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at liliverpool university, said, " a fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on of effectiveness. "
they said they expected adverse claims that " current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking " are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
in reality, only one meeting attended by 12 people led to the drafting of a model of multi-criteria decision-making analysis (mcda) summarising their views on the negative effects associated with various products containing nicosia; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research work.
mckee and capewell, said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called euroswiss health, whose executive director has been said to have received funding in the past from british american tobacco for an independent study.
it also validated the accreditation of bat in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
they added that one of 12 participants in the meeting declared the funding from a producer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding there are reports would have received from the cigarette and tobacco manufacturing company, philip morris international.
arguments were not provided provided on which members of the panwere selected selected, but these include some " shats " known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare financing for industry in the work.
other participants in the meeting are not known for expertise in tobacco control.
the head of the tobacco control station in pierre also attended the meeting.
the research work drafted by the group " convincingly amses " the fact that there is a lack of " solid evidence of the detrimental effect most products have according to most criteria, " mckee and capewell said.
however, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the audy report.
mckee and capewell said the opposite claims that " so far, there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers " are premature.
professor kevin fenton, director of the health department at osijek, says he has been to claims in bmj has been responded in the past.
he said " electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking "
one in two people who smokers all their lives lose their lives because of this vice.
all the evidence suggests that the risk posed by cigarettes for health health under minor compared, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
jerusalem has a clear duty to inform the public about information arising and those that does not emerge from evidence, particularly in view of the high level of public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
year, around 80,000 people lose their lives due to a smoking-associated disease, and the annual costs incurred by the national health due to smoking reach gbp 2 billion.
making the current evidence clearly - that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risk, they only present a fraction of the detrimental effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.

violinist david grimal: during the era of bach there were no world tours.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people working, artists rather than commercial representatives.
french violinist david grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a shock but also as an initiator of a less common project, entitled' strange strange', as he himself says les dissonson- - orchestra orchestra up of international soloists and talented musicians, interpreting a symphony repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes so so at least landscape
les dissonenda was at year the enescu festival year with two performances: a performance sunday, in which the list was david grimal, founder of the orchestra, and one months, when violincelist xavier phillips was at the fore, with enescu's by comprogramme being nelipsite.
both performances, on the athens stage, showed the public another kind of performing classical music.
les dissonenda appeared on the music scene in 2004,, at the time, being the only classic music whole in which there is no conductor.
the conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
it is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - they speak of instrumachers, not by composers.
they are trained as' specialised workers'.
they themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.
on the other hand of the scene, for the public, all the musical referation focuses on the conductor.
and thus the business, the music industry, is commercimarketing.
therefore, we are no longer talking about music.
so, if we look at this world, we have, on the one hand qualified workers, which is stupid, and a public who cannot listen, but it must look, which and is stupid', david grimal believes.
the violinist tells that the change in the way music came from the " musical decetions " from his career as shock.
i was like a high-level athlete who was supposed to make the same exercise throughout the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and bring money to the musical industry.
10 years ago, when i was around 30 years old, i found this very depressing, because we no longer found human creativity and fraternity in this system.
so i have found no sense in continuing along this road.
that is how i decided to create les dissoniri.
this was in 2004, and at the time no one did so without a conducconductor:' the musical, highly conservative, did not want such projects'.
" how do i imagine marketing with a collective of musicians where there is ego no longer? " the artist asks.
david grimal acknowledges les dissondo is " a luxury, " saying that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the project's success to live.
in 10 years of ensemble existence, the lack of a conductor did not prove to be a hindrance in the music act:' curiously, the more we weigh a more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, all musicians are obliged to be present in the work and not just in role, " grimal says, adding that at sunday's performance' we were 74 conductors on the stage'.
in grimal's view, the enăescu festival is a' very courageous' one, precisely because it also invited les dissonaya:' an extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras in the world singsing and 3 times a day present, and in the middle of these orchestras you have also invited this strange group'.
in a temple of orchestras tradition, such as the enănescu festival, there is the place and interest in something different, which breaks breaks barriers.
speaking about enescu's work, the violinist acknowledges he feels romanian music of the famous romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced ennnescu works on his repertoire.
grimal notes that enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is when we talk about george enescu and romanian music, " because there is also a george enescu who made french music. "
grimal advocates a change the way in classical musical education is carried out, believing that' the musician profession, as it is organised today, has a death iz itt " and that' the future of music represents music itself'.
we do not need to make the world tour 5 times a year if it serves nothing.
during the age of bach, there were no world tournaments.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people working who were artists rather than commercial representatives.
for me, organising concerts, festivals, tournaments, the launch of albu, are all formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they do serve music.
if not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, no longer has freedom.
to illustrate this phenomenon, david grimal set an example to romanian products before and post after accession to the eu:' in romania, before you entered the eu, you had good vegetables and meat'.
in order to enter the eu, you had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
production and agriculture reach the service of the supermarkets, as is the case in france.
with music the same thing happens, it is the same logic.
les dissonmakes tomatoes may not too beautiful, but when we cut cut them they are true tomatoes.
in an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system to understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done from educational policy.
" if we considered -- as the koreans, the chinese, the japanese do - that western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its learning into school, would reintroduce concerts on television and through this education there would no longer be need to sell musical by-products, " grimal believes.
there are certainly things in classical musical education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarised.
it depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if we form a musician who will perform on an instrument and, above all, a musician.
this is a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) it must be in some way, if we want to form a musician, it is something something altogether.
after you opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? " the french artist asks smiling.
grimal shows that for artists, the reward for another kind of doing music comes precisely from overcoming this " soldier " status, overcoming what " they believe are their limits ": " musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and is why after the concert smilsmilcome. "
david grimal spoke about his music project and his vision of music and the artist in the " ideas festival, " a discussion with the public held at the george enescu international festival by the aspen romania institute.

do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child, who like the films?
it gives him the opportunity to get it.
in september, as part of the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children willing to reach future stars and between 8 to 16, cinema city is looking for " small big voices, " giving them an extraordinary opportunity to double two figures in a famous animation film.
if emphasis was placed in classical drawings on near the voice of the actor the specificnature of the animated figure recently on the creation of the stories, those to also also being taken into account, and they are usually well known actors.
cinema city romania, however, wants to discover new voices, which is why we are starting an unprecedented campaign.

fedex gains mixed, lower fiscal forecasts for 2016
fedex declared disappointing results for the last quarter, with the supply giant reducing profit estimates for the year due to low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
the company also said it plans to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
during the same period last year, fedex announced it would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
the company's shares declined by about 2.5 per cent in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of wednesday's opening bell.
fedex corp. said he expects to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in may year year, 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
analysts expected $10.884, according to a biltset survey.
the estimate drop comes despite price hikes by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 january and the higher surcharges for land transport of large or high heavy yweight packages, which will apply since november.
the company said it still expects increased gains from the previous year as a result of reduced costs, higher incomes and development of online trade.
president and director general fred smith said " the company faces a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially in terms to global production and trade. "
employment plans during the holidays were announced a day after the competition ups said it plans to employ 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of employment it made last year.
in the quarter that ended on august 31st, fedex won $692m, 6% more than the previous year.
earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share by 12 analysts who responded to the zacks investment research survey.
profit increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
six analysts who participated in zacks' survey estimated $12.23 billion.
fedex has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to stagnation in revenues from its unit express.
but the explosion in online shopping salated the results of the fedex ground division.
in the last quarter, revenues from the ground division rose by 29%, but operational revenues have practically stalled due to higher costs for high packages and their own insurance.
the express unit saw an increase in revenues due to higher basic tariffs, while revenues from the cfsp division have fallen due to rising costs.
in pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, fedex shares dropped $3.85 or 2.5% to usd 150.15.
at the closure 11 11 per cent year-on-year fell on tuesday and 17 per cent compared to the record maximum on 11 11th.
at its most awaited meeting in years, policy policymakers within the federal reserve will spend two days this week around a table of mahon honduras an by 27 legs to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
above them, at an end of the central bank chamber, a diral painting by the united states will be termined.
the map is intended to recall that janet l. yellen, chairman of the edf, and his colleagues must put the nation interests of the interests above all.
the central bank has been given a dual task from congress: to maximise employment rates in the us and to maintain price stability.
but since the great economic crisis, edf leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
and this third task could be factor x in a decision too difficult to predict, to be announced on tuesday, and which will determine whether the us economy is ready to be torn apart by the unprecedented stimulus provided by the almost zero short-term interest rate in force since the end of 2008.
even though most the data indicate a growing economy, the recent agitation in the global financial markets could frighten edf officials already wary of adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
" obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will follow, " said lindsey m. piegza, chief economist at brokeraj firm stica nicolaus & co.
" but i think that if they looked for an excuse not to increase interest rates, the growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait any longer, " she said.
there is no consensus on the decision that the edf will take, which in itself causing instability in the financial market.
about half of the economists recently questioned by bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
but the financial markets expect the edf to postpone, with a key indicator showing that problikelihood of growth is only 30%.
this would indicate a drop on the stock exchange if the edf increases the interest rates unless policymakers shiered the blow by pledging to take a long time before the next growth.
on tuesday, dow jones industrial media moved up 228.89 points, or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
the momentum was triggered by expectations that edf decision makers will maintain the stable interest rate this week, said john lonski, chief economist at moody's capital markets research group.
" it would be surprising for the edf to increase the interest rate at the moment, " lonski said.
if edf decision makers did so,' they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets'.
other experts have said that an increase in interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty as to when the edf acts.
just a month ago, the edf seemed to be about to increase rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of us recovery.
yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expects an interest rate increase this year despite objections raised by the liberals that more economic progress was needed.
although job creation slowed down in august, labour market growth was solid this year.
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level seen by the edf as full employment.
salary gains have showed signs of growth.
and although inflation has continued not to achieve the central bank's annual goal, edf decision makers said that one key reason was the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices.
the economy " can cope at higher rates and needs them, given the tension in the labour market, " said ian shepherdson, chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics.
but the global financial markets began entering fibrilations later this month after china devalued its currency.
the dow jones industrial average dropped by 16% below the record maximum achieved in may, as investors feared that the slowing in the chinese economy would drag king world growth down.
the market observed somewhat this month, with the dow index now being about 10% below the maximum in may.
for edf decision makers, market agitation is added to the complex calculation at a time of interest rates are rising.
" without what has happened in the financial markets and news of weakening the chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be stronger at the meeting, " said stephen d. oliner, an experienced researcher at the ucla ziman centre for real estate and former edf official.
now he expects to wait at least a month to better manage effects effects.
" there is a great deal of uncertainty about which the impact on the us economy will be and they almost do not have data on which events events following china will be based, " oliner said.
the well-being of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the edf, so it should basically not be taken into account in decision making.
in reality, however, the edf has become global monetary authority.
in recent years, the central bank's influence has been huge.
simply alluding by the then president ben s. bernanke, in 2013 that the edf could' narrow' its monetary expansion has triggered the earthquake in world markets.
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly emanating, edf officials are expected not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to better interpret the world economy.
his decision-making process is " more art than science, " said zachary karabell, head of the global strategy department at welfare management firm envestnet inc.
jeffrey lacker, president of the federal reserve bank in richmond, va, said this month that " the edf has an oversized response history to changes in market market that appear be unrelated to economic bases. "
lacker, a voting member of the federal committee on the open market, a decision-making body, which supported an increase in interest rates, offered the decisions of 1998-99 as an example.
a financial crisis that affected asia led the edf to reduce its reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, " despite implications with possibility of limited identification for the development of the us, " lacker said.
a year later, edf officials returned to those falls.
the edf should raise the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said adam s. posen, a former member of the commission for setting an interest rate at the bank of england.
the latest turbulent period is far from that level, he said.
" we certainly don't want to end up in a position to fear an increase in interest rates because the markets have upset, " said posen, president of the institute for international economics economics peterson.
the federal reserve act continues to have a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, i do not think it should take premature action.

4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in nepal
four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern nepal after police fired rubber bullets at the crowd demonstrating against the country's new proposed constitution, an official said wednesday.
the violence occurred late tuesday in the rupandehi district, about 280km west of kathmandu's capital.
according to bishnu prasad dhakal, district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
mr dhakal said police forces used tear gas then shoed up before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
according to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
it was not clear immediately why rubber bullets, which are known known to kill, but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
the clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of nepal, where members of the madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
protests also existed in western nepal, where the tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes triggered on 10 august,
when four key political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into the provinces -- a major step towards a new constitution, however, a highly controversial issue in nepal, which is governed centrally for hundreds of years.
the procedure for drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in april.
this week in kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution, and officials said the new charter could be adopted on sunday.

weight reduction surgery could be useful in the case of diabetics with light obesity
the benefits of the cyrillic for reducing hardship for with light obesity, with type 2-sugar diabetet could remain for at least five years, according to a new study.
it is still premature to say whether light obesity diabeties live more after surgical weight weight loss intervention than those following unhirurgical treatments.
" it is long needed to centralise mortality data, " said dr robin blackstone, a specialist on obesity surgery, car wrote an report on the new study in jama minsk.
operations to lose of weight, referred also surgery of barrier atric, use various methods to reduce dental.
they reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
over the years, impedric surgery surgery has proved efficiency in the treatment type 2-sugar diabetes, but most studies have taken place on people with morbida obesity, with a corporate mass index (imc) 35 or higher.
the imc, a unit of measure of weight in relation to equal, is considered normal from 18.5 to 24.9.
the imc of least 25 indicates that one one person is overweight and people with more than 30 are considered obze.
you can calculate your imc by accessing: 1 usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
for the new study, researchers at taiwan's min-sheng general hospital used data collected after 2007 in a name in compare two types of impedatric surgery - bypass astric and gastrectomtomin manman- in medical treatment of type 2 2 diababes sugar in people with light obesity.
the imc mediu to people suffering surgery intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the survey.
meanwhile, the imc in people who received unhirurgical treatments against sugar sugar diabetes remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
of those who suffered surgeical intervention, sugar diabetes completely healed at 36% and in part to 28%.
in the group treaty by medical methods, by comparison, sugar ed diabetes has fully healed to just 1% and partly to just 2% of the subjects.
in addition, control of terrible tension, trigliceridees and lmr cholesterol " bad' were generally better in the surgeical group, " the authors concluded.
researchers also monitored sanguin level of hemoglobina a1c, which reflects the level of glicemia over time.
researchers write that the best level of hemoglobina a1c is less than 7%.
after surgery intervention, the average level of hemoglobina a1c has dropped from around 9% to about 6%.
but in the treaty treaty through medical methods, it was maintained at around 8%.
but this improved " glicemic control " -- reflected in improved levels of hemocitina a1c -- have not reduced the death rate to five years, according to chief researcher dr chih-cheng hsu and colleagues.
the research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgeical intervention.
in the fifth year, compared the gastrectomie group in manson, the group with bypass surgintervention lost more in weight (18.7 compared to 14.2 kg), registered lower falls in the imc value (7.4 compared to 5.1) and hemoglobina a1c ((3.1% compared to 2.1%) and presented a higher complete remission mission of sugar sugar sugar..
although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery five years later, there is evidence in a study by high weipeople in sweden that life surgeage intervention, says blackstone, of arizona university, the faculty of medicine -- phoenix.
in the swedish study, obese people who suffered barrier atric surgery showed a probability about 29% lower to die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried at more conventional methods.
although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival for patients who suffered surgeical intervention, blackstone said it was an optimistic issue for people with the imc under 35 interested in the procedure.
" this is the point this work is critical, because it says that this surgeical intervention is safe in the lower imc group, " without increasing the risk of death or renal disease, she says.
blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start -- taking the weight seriously then the patient's imc reaches 27-30.
" i think we wait too long before we urge the people to take this seriously, " she said.
i believe that once they have accumulated these genetic changes which have shorcircued their bodies by posing them to obesity and diabetet, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
" it is impossible for everyone to come to europe " -- dalai lama - rrt news
europe could not receive all refugees, the dalai lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis lies in the middle east.
the tibetan buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the mother countries of refugees.
the dalai lama spoke about the problem of the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of oxford's dalai lama compasascentre, dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to britain.
he said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even every continent.
he also stressed that, while admirable, the response of the western european countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
" it is impossible for everyone to come to europe, " he said in his speech.
although the dalai lama praised germany and austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed it was only a temporary solution.
" it is wonderful care for several thousand refugees, but at the same time we have to think about long-term solutions to bring sincere peace and development, especially through education, to muslim countries, " he stressed.
ultimately, we need to think about ways of reducing crimes in their countries.
we need to reduce the use of force.
the force has never solved these problems, " he added.
on the issue of violence, the dalai lama also commented on george bush's actions following the terrorist attacks on 11 september, saying that the violent response from the us led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
after the events of 11 september, i expressed my condolences in a letter to president bush and told him to resolve this problem without turning to violence.
i know his reasons were strong but he used force and caused unexpected consequences, " the dalai lama said.

why do i witness execution in oklahoma
later today, apart from bellate legal intervention, i will look at how a man is sentenced to death.
if it happens, and i hope it does not happen, i will stand in a room for observers in the execution chamber of the penitprison of oklahoma, and see how richard glossip is executed by managing the lethal injection.
he asked me to be one of four officials witnesses to his death.
the invitation first came in january, through its best friend, and although i was shocked, i accepted.
as the day in good approaches, i am appat the idea.
so why do so?
i agreed because i thought it was a good way to tell all the story of capital punishment.
it would offer a single perspective.
admittedly, journalists can witness executions in america and, because applications usually exceed beyond the number of available, a macabra lottery is taking place to decide who will be elected.
oklahoma reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
those elected will view execution with impartiality.
i cannot do that.
i would stand next to closest friends friends richard glossip, in addition i have developed my own link with him during months of telephone conversations and a two-half-hour visit.
i like the kind.
we often laugh a great deal when we speak.
prison authorities say they cannot be a witness and journalist, so i will not be allowed to have a card and a skx in me to note what i see.
i will have to try to remember all the details.
a journalist from oklahoma accused me on twitter of compromising my impartiality.
that is the lesson.
it tells the detaine's story as he wants, it gains access.
i complained about it.
he acknowledged that' he could have made better', but he still believes i am wrong.
richard glossip did not agree with some of the things i have said and wrote.
he does not tell me what to write, and i would not do so even if they asked for me.
i told him that he could remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
but he wants an international report to be present writing about the subject.
he believes that, if it dies, advertising will help the movement against death penalty.
kim bellware, a reporter for huffington post, will be with me.
if you want to learn more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that we have made.
i will not come back to all details here.
i cannot say with certainty that richard glossip is innocent.
his actions following the murder of barry van treese face him guilty of complicity.
but i think he is unlikely not to be guilty of murder.
i certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
i think its execution is wrong.
and i will look at it by dying from this perspective.
i cannot claim to be totally objective.
for this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
from me, you will find out how it is to look at a man you like by dying unnecessarily.
peter moody claims steware tried to spy him him and threatens to withdraw from races
peter moody said steware racing his victory tried to infiltrate a spy on his cracts last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from races.
she has launched an attack against stewards and the integrity department al racing victoria, saying they are conducting a personal campaign against him, a drop that filled the glass being lady tatai's removal from the race due to treatment administered on race day.
moody told fair fax media that he has always tried to do the best for flights and is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome of lidari' cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
for 18 months he swallowed allowed his words about statements about spies and did not want to resembthe' vulvulgle that does not reach grapes'.
" i was not going to say anything about that and i have kept quiet for a long time but sometimes you reach a level of such high frustration that everything outbursts at suddenly, " moody said.
it is a fact that it has continued.
sometimes you react and you have to suffer the consequences, and i will have to live with what i have said.
i will go home last night and sleep peacefully.
i want to go with my head high and i want the owners i am working to see that i strive to offer them all the best.
since they start to believe that this is not the case, i have to give up on the trainer profession.
i will then have to think about what i will do with my certification.
earlier, moody threw the bomb in an interview with racing.com saying the integrity department tried to spy on its walls.
" eighteen months ago, terry bailey, dayle brown and dr brian stewart were sitting in a room with a man -- whose name i will say if asked -- and offered to engage him to my walls to provide information about work there, " moody told racing.com.
i obviously consider myself as a trisor.
if so, then it should all step down because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
robert roulston, former rvl president, david moodie, current president of rvl and bernard saundry, current executive director of rvl, knew at the time and i know today.
should i think there is something personal?
is it necessary for the rvl to start to the the backbone and can hold people from outside tratraresponsible for what is happening in the industry?
do i have a poor influence on the industry?
so bad is my influence on the so industry?
perhaps that is how i see others.
perhaps it has to take a license to me and give me aside, and i have no doubt that the statements they are making now could lead them to think about this option.
however, i have reached the point where i no longer care, and that saddens me.
it saddens me very greatly.
i will put pressure and lead them to make a decision.
my family supports me and i can leave.
thracian frustration has increased with the long investigation into cobalt testing involving the leaders, and the removal led him to say he could " put his license on the table. "
moody, whose name is most often associated with training the undefeated champion black caviar, labelled the treatment rule on race day as " ridiculous " after applying on the feet of a aplasma with namol or argla, which violates the rules.
it violates the races' rules.
i have to take full responsibility for this, " he says.
one of my employees wrongly put them namol on his foot.
it could have happened last night.
it could have happened yesterday, which happened.
it was on race day.
moody could be disqualified for three months for the race day treatment consisting of handtis, for which steware opened an investigation.
it is a joke.
the people who make these rules know nothing about ways.
" we all understand that there is a need for rules but but has went too far, " moody said.
the driver who hit and fled crash site in cobram arrested
police arrested a man after a collision with a bicicist in cobram later the weekend and followed by the flee from the scene of the accident.
the biccliwas transported by helicopter to royal melbourne hospital, seriously injured after being hit by a car early saturday on the murray valley highway.
police representatives say the driver of the car did not stop helping the injured bicclike.
on monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to police in shepparton.

biccliist, a 40-year-old man from cobram, remains admitted in a stable condition.
coach melbourne storm, craig bellamy, is responding to opponents in the wrestling charges.
coach melbourne storm craig bellamy called criticism of the plates tactics by his team used as " distorted topics " raised by the two main favourites in nrl.
coach sydney rooster, trent robinson, said the referees allowed the storm players to " take them in trboard " the team in the nervous match storm in the qualification final in sydney late friday.
brisbane coach broncos coach wayne bennett made a slight reference to storm after his team's victory in the north queensland cowboys qualifier late saturday when he called the match a " demonstration " of the rugby league and said the two teams in queensland were not much good at wrestling.
bellamy jumped in defence of the plates tactics his team addressed, and said the players simply focused on " contact " when they liked.
bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticised his team, meaning they were concerned that storm would defeat them.
" things don't stop there -- we didn't hear trent robinson to complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2, " bellamy said on wednesday.
i can guarantee that we have not changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, so just as in the last six weeks, we have really placed on contact in plates, and so we have changed the situation.
trent has been in office for three years and obviously has a wonderful team, so it is probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
we are know how it is always the case during this period of year.
bellamy contradicted bennett's idea of " animating football, " reminding bennett's st george-illawarra dragons won the the 2010 2010 playing " boring " football.
wayne talks about palpicing football.
he argued his opinion by comparing his game saturday evening with our game friday evening and spoke about how palpitative the game was, " bellamy said.
i remember in 2010, st george received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team, and wayne said he was not interested in as black under angangle.
but now it has a team that can play what we would see as tangible football, especially because of quick young midfielders.
this kind of game you want to do it when you have such players.
he brought the argument in 2010, he now wants everyone to adopt their style of play -- not any team has two midfielders like anthony milford and ben hunt to be able to play that.
it gives me more confidence because they are saying this because they are somewhat concerned about the match with us.
six weeks ago they were probably not think of us when they were thinking the important matches.
bellamy also pointed out that the match between storm and roosterwas a bolder th over the score compared to the match between broncos and cowboys.
the broncos match was probably a good match, have we not yet seen it, how much was the score? 16-12?
our match ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, does that mean paltuing game?
or does it mean taking breaks and not marching?
there are plans for me.
if i talk about us, it means that some some point we could meet them.
storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home either with north queensland cowboys or with cronulla sharks, in next saturday's preliminary preliminary final in aami park, with tickets going for sale starting next tuesday morning.

friendsfest: the edy series that taught us important lessons about about friendship between men
the absence of similar figures in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the past 15 years.
in 2013, the suicide was the main cause of death in 20-45 men in britain, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
in an attempt to address the problem, the campaign against unfortunate life (versa against pierre miserés (calm) has appointed 2015 as the man year, wanting wanting question question culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
friendship is at the heart of the fight towards the success of this challenge.
a recent study of more than 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough many friends " with a healthy mood, " his chances of recovery double.
equally, for people who are not suppressed, a circle of mental healthy friends halves the probability of mental disorders emerging.
of course, in order for friendship to have an effect, it must first and foremost be accessible.
in this era of communication dominated by social media, where emphasis is placed on style rather not substance, the immediate character of the response often takes priority before significant contact.
our digital lives have doubled the need to create the apparent of a strong figure, open to fun and successful, even though in reality it is isolation that dominates.
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsecal values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our internal desire for personal development and friendship - which even deeply affect our mental health.
the bilonononor of the o of a video game recently explained that the money really does not buy happiness.
the beauty of series friends was to he turned attention to the idea.
the charers were not defined by the jobs but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
the huur of joey and chandler's frequent when they look at football in the convenient seats and passion of ross for rachel came from the fact is known that men can associate themselves with the situation, even though they often bow to completely explore their feelings.
as a social worker explained to me:'... my role to listen to people with the suicide and depressed trend has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference'.
often, people who appeal to us do not feel able to speak to friends.
his old saying dealing alone is strong, as is the sense of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about issues.
friends are one of the series that come to mind when i try to provide more mechanisms for psychological adaptation in the long term.
the series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
however much does objective, outside intervention helps, via telephone, people had arrived in times of desperation, long-term support comes from the family and close friends.
thus, if you participate in this weekend in friendsfest organised by the central comedy, with the full drafting of filplatforms to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in central perk.
or, even still, if you see someone alone in starbucks, smilile and welcome.
it is never known what difference your friendship could make.
friends are been broadcast by central comedy from the outset -- all 236 episodes -- at ok friendsfest.
di maria marks, helps bsp malma aside
angel di maria celebrates with blaise matuidi and edinson cavani after marking malmo.
angel di maria marked in her debut match in the champions league on tuesday and helped the bsp force itself before the swedish's malmo.
we are still chronently presenting the match to you and your reaction to the game.
angel di maria and edinson cavani did their job, paris saint-germain starting the champions league league group match series, with a reassuring 2-0 victory over malmo in a match on the park des prenta on tuesday.
di maria marked less than four minutes after the start of her debut match in the champions league in the bsp, bringing the french champions to the lead though she missed a number of opportunities before securing her advantage with cavani's marked goal in the 61st minute.
reaching in group a with real madrid and sahtior donetk, paris needed a strong start against the swedish champions because the french team's goal is not only to qualify for optimists but also an improvement in the road to the quarterfinals in each of the last three aments.
but while taking the points, laurent blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with zlatan ibrahimovic who wasted the goal opportunity before being replaced by the team in his hometown and the club he brilliant career began in 1999.
" it is not easy to win at home or in travel to the champions league, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable difference from the next few classes, even though there are still issues that we need to improve during the season, " blanc says.
this is a good sign.
we wanted to win and did so, although i am sorry that we have not able to give one or two more goals.
ibrahimovic returned after injuries at one of three changes to the paris team, with a 2-2 stakes obtained home from borghex in the 1 league at weekend, but but di maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
last month when transferred from manchester united, argentargentean offensive midfielder was appointed the man who will take the bsp to the next level in europe and demonstrated this when he tasred to marco verratti's care behind malmo's defence before shoshooting incredibly more johan wiland, in the long corner on the gate right.
but if someone expected the bsp to win by merking its fingers, they were disappointed.
malmo, who defeated celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine holders of national teams, with a defence of five people and two defensive midfielders, was a powerful adversary.
but their attack was not impressive, with the exception of nikola djurdjic's suwho switched through kevin tra's post in the 34th minute.
instead, the bsp players slowed down the pace several times, giving some unnecessary sloles and completing the interventions, even ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five attempts in the first repression alone and was then replaced by cavani even after the resumption of the game.
ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skilin supporting her colleagues, with his his care di maria sent to a sut deviated by wiland over his gate in the 52nd minute.
the second goal was finally scored after an hour walpassed from the match, thanks to cavani, uruguayan who scored the sixth season goal after ibrahimovic passed from maxwell's belt.
this goal eliminated the hope of malm's hope for rebalancing the score and only a superb stop by wiland from a distance to david luiz kept the final score before the newly met reluctant el lavezzi was cancelled a goal in extensions.
the norwegian coach of the team in malmo, age haid, later said the bsp was over-class and that " the last match we played in the champions league was december last year. "
since then, we have only played in the swedish league, which does not up to the same level.
qualifications are not enough.
below the palace for the bsp.
they have made an excellent game.

xi urges for broader expansion of global economy
on tuesday, president xi jinping told a group tasked with reforming that the economy must open more broader to the outside world in order to fuel growth.
" china must commit itself to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving opening policies, " xi said at the 16th meeting of the central governing group for the continuation of general reforms (central icegroup for president in aia).

the activity report of the tvr leadership, rejected in the committees: stelian tanase risks dismissal
parliament's culture committees on wednesday rejected an activity report by the romanian television company board for 2014.
17 lawmakers voted to reject the report, one against rejection (senator varujan vosganian), and one abstained.
the text of the report will be submitted to the permanent offices brought together.
they are expected to decide next week.
it will be discussed at the next united plenary.
" i think that given this situation it will be done relatively quickly, " said senate culture committee chairman georgica severin.
he added that " it was of common sense " for the tvr leadership to also be present at the meeting, as no representatives of the tvr leadership was present at the meeting of culture committees.
it was common sense of the leadership of the tvr to be present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like this.
the invitation came to members as early last night, with an approximating hour that we did not know an hour, but today, after the meeting of the joint offices, i personally sent a fax to the helm of tvr inviting it.
i believe that when you are convened, you are a budget wage, paid from public taxes and called to a joint committee meeting even if you do not like alive.
" because it is your obligation of service, you are in an institution subparliament, " severin said after a committee joint meeting by parliament's culture.
he added that financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative negative opinion of the budget committees.
debts have also saw how they continued, came up with the idea that this year it would have been up to to date, but did not paid out of the historical ones.
" i remind you that not from my fault or anyone else in these committees that recreational was lost with the banks and with the tax, there are clear management problems, " severin added.
he added that once the activity report is rejected by the joint plenary, elections would follow for a new board of directors, and it would elect the institution's director-general.
i do not know who will be proposed for this position.
wonders will not be done.
what is important is to take political decisions in order for this institution to function.
i am not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will arise who will stand in the queue here and beat.
i hope that those who decide, parliament's plenary, with their vote will choose the people who will lead the tvr very reason.
there must be people who know what is happening there, have experience and have a great deal of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
i do not know who will be, if you ask me what qualities they should have - common sense in attitude towards wage earners because it is a malicious of petitions coming from employees, complaints, redundancies.
" when you receive such complaints 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster, " the chairman of the committee of culture in the senate ended.
although he did not appear in parliament, tvr president-general stelian tanase sent a letter to the chamber of deputies speaker valeriu zgonea calling for parliament to consider a a of measures measures could lead to the the rescue and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexation of tv tax.
in the letter, stelian tanase calls, in addition to the indexation of tv tax, the amendment and completion of hg 978 / 2003 on the tax for the television service, in order to update provisions to technological change to day, as well as to regulate the procedure for control in the area of payment of tv tax and finding finding offences and application applying sanctions and penalties.
he also wants a provision to be issued to extend the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become srtv mandatations to collect the tv tax by involving anre in regulating this activity.
in his opinion, it is necessary to set a maximum ceiling of 5% on the fee from proceeds.
stelian tanase is calling for reducing the vat rate for specific specific to public television and the contribution to the cnc from 15% to 3%, but also changes to the 41 / 1994, with the view to the possibility of receiving budget / financing allocations to purchase licenses for major cultural and sports events -- the world football championship, the golden sta, eurovision.
he says that srtv will default in the coming months as labour law obliges the employer to the implementation of court rulings, even if they are not final, and wage rights are honoured as a priority over any other obligation.
the tvr administration has constantly made efforts to cut spending on staff and tv production.
" this has reduced journeys and other cost-generating activities, a number of trade contracts were renegotiated, and in late july tvr news was closed, " president tvr's letter said.
young taners appreciate that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied through their own efforts alone.
" without the support of state institutions -- government, parliament, the presidency -- romanian television will, sooner or later be unable to carry out its public mission more, " the letter noted.
the leadership of the chamber of deputies has decided to send the letter to the committee on culture.

ilie sârbu voted vice president at the court of auditors
parliament's plenary voted on wednesday the appointment of psd senator ilie sârbu, prime minister victor ponta's wife, as vice president of the audit authority at the court of auditors.
according to mediafax, 290 " in favour " and 108 " against " were registered.
the vote was secret with ballots.
pnl representatives were the only ones to vote against this proposal, digi24 reported.
in fact, the liberals criticised sârbu's appointment to this post and announced that they will challenge it to the ccr when he has a dossier in the dna, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
ilie sârbu has 30 days under the law, to resign from the senate, because the new post at the court of auditors does not allow him to do politics anymore.

ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander, irrational claims
hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto harshcondemned early wednesday, romanian prime minister victor ponta's claims that political decision makers in hungary are " nothing better than those in syria, libya or other countries fleeing refugees. "
" yesterday, victor ponta lost his self-control and, with his irrational statements, offends the entire hungary, " the hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
civilised european politicians do not say such uncontrolled slander.
" his remarks have only one explanation: he has completely lost support in domestic politics in romania, " added the head of hungarian diplomacy, according to mti.
in a post on facebook late tuesday, prime minister victor ponta said he wanted to draw attention and sanction the behaviour of senior hungarian government officials, who he believe " are a disgrace to eu culture and values. "
i do not want to respond to the challenges of hungarian government representatives.
" these are a disgrace to the culture and values of the eu; and in anti-semitic attitudes, and when it comes to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis! " ponta added on facebook.
the romanian prime minister added he is ever of sensible and sustainable solutions in the event of the refugee crisis, praising aggressive brutalities and laws would not solve the problem.
barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will just show that in hungary, in the heart of europe, they are political decision makers nothing better than those in syria, libya or other countries from which those refugees flee!
" i believe in solidarity, in sensible and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of european values -- what we see in recent days in hungary runs runs completely counter to precisely these goals and values! " the head of the romanian executive stressed.
earlier on tuesday, hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto described as " mere lies " romanian prime minister victor ponta's remarks about hungary's management of the refugee crisis, viewing the claims as inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to mti.
the head of hungarian diplomacy also noted on tuesday that the romanian prime minister's " extremist and false remarks " relate to the internal political crisis in romania and made it clear that budapest apologises from the romanian side.
szijjarto referred to a statement by prime minister victor ponta on monday.
what i have said and always say is that i am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing borders, like all those who come are terrorists, are nonsense of the the middle ages and i am totally opposed to this approach.
if we can get more, let us get, the problem is our logistics capacity to treat those people as people, not as it treats our hungarian neighbours with beat and the serious.
" that's what i don't agree with, " the head of the romanian executive, said at a press conference in targu-jiu.
also on tuesday, peter szijjarto announced that budapest decided to start preparations on the ground for expanding the fence to border with romania builbuilding on the border with border with, to deal with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
later, prime minister victor ponta said hungary's decision to raise a fence at the borders solve nothing of the refugee problem and " takes hungary out of europe. "
what link exists between osama bin laden and the collapse of mecca butcral
the saudi authorities announced that saudi giant binladin group, belonging to osama bin laden's family is " partly responsible " for the collapse of a cranes on friday at the big mosque in mecca, a result of which 107 people died.
according to an investigative commission, the company has not " comply with the safety rules, " the saudi news agency (spa), the bbc reported.
company directors have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation is completed in the case case.
the firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
the construction firm is owned by the family of former al-qaeda terrorist network leader osama bin laden.
the company, founded by osama bin laden's father 80 years ago and is currently headed by the brother of former terrorist leader, bakr.
binladen group has been working on expanding large mosques for 4 years so that it can host several pilgrims.
the accident occurred late friday during a storm, when a crcher, probably unbalanced by strong wind shelves, collapsed on the eastern part of the mosque roof in mecca.
as a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
how did hagi close mouth mouth their challenges challenges
widely widely seen the largest romanian footbalplayer in history, gica hagi was labelled after he stepped out of work, a a weak coach who cannot be able to perform in the new post as well.
after unfortunate experiences at the national team, star or galatasaray, hagi took over the coach coach role in his his constant future a year ago.
fixed fixed a year after taking the team, the king showed that he is capable of turning a team struggling to save from downgrading to a top one.
so, a year later, the future recorded, with hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 stakes and 11 defeats.
the balance sheet is one of a top team, bebewith european cups.
things took an even better turn for the future this season, as the team reached second in the 1 league with 19 points, one less than astra leader astra giurgiu.
the future also has the best attack in the 1 league, with 20 goals (on equality with astra), more than double than the star.
on the other hand, even if it brought several experienced players to the team, hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and names have emerged recently in the start team such as ianis hagi or hodorogea.
the club's policy made the future a team to watch for teams abroad, so the hagi sold 1.5m euros this summer -- ianis hagi (fiorentina -- 1m euros) and alexandru mitrita (bari - 500,000 euros).
along with the star, the future is the only profitable team in the 1 league, according to data from the trade register.
in the refugee crisis, romania has so far played as a small country.
it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
large countries come up with solutions for the entire eu, says cristian ghinea, a member of the executive college of the romanian centre for european policies.
in an interview with ziare.com, cristian ghinea showed that europe cannot be transformed into a fortress and purely police means will not work in this crisis:' perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come from'.
but there are masses that have started and we cannot return history.
migration is a reality to which we need to adapt to the best as possible and adapt them to us.
in the opinion of cristian ghinea, we are at an extremely emotional time when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
once he passes, europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the schengen area must be changed:' schengen is now like an animal created in another age and was not adapted to the situation now'.
where are we in the refugee crisis after this jha council which has, in fact, solved nothing?
it is clear that ec president in agreement with donald tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
all the predicwere said that they would have had the necessary votes.
before the treaty of lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in jha and any state could block any decision.
that is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
after lisbon, the normal procedure applies, which the ec has the initiative, and the council approves it with the vote of 55% of states, which is 16, accounting for 65% of the eu population.
the calculations said that the votes existed.
but they did not want to move forward.
as this is a sensitive issue, reactions have emerged emerged in germany itself against chancellor merkel's opening policy and did not want it to appear in many countries as an' eu sends us migrants to head' response.
they have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because this wave is is creating a huge problem for schengen governance and we will probably see great changes there in the coming period.
so mandatory quotas have not really been eliminated, but has the subject only been allowed to get coined?
yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement by frontex in managing external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are on the schengen's external border to the responsibility of community agencies.
greece's border with turkey is also germany's border with turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has set the limits to the old schengen system.
perhaps the dublin principle will be waided that migrants are the responsibility of the state in which they enter the first time, because it is unsustainable.
if greece shoks, you cannot say forever that it is greece's job.
the problem is common.
precisely because the problem is common, is a solution possible without a precise, perhaps even binding, mechanism for sharing receiving effort?
nobody knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work if they are come to them.
because a problem remains: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to romania or portugal, but to sweden or germany?
i do not believe that the european states will be able to take migrants high: you go to country x or the y country.
some single filtering centres will probably be reached, greece or turkey, where asylum applications can be processed.
work is being done on solutions like this.
but the problem does not have a simple solution.
there are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without any experience, like romania, where the problem of migrants will increase xenophotrend.
the fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in turkey, lebanon, jordan, who are sitting in precarious camps and who have only just begun to go for europe.
an estimate says that only 10% were able to leave, winter is difficult to past the mediterranean, but we expect an perhaps even larger wave next year.
what do we do with their people?
my stunoror is that we will get used to this problem, we will no longer look at it so catastrophic from a point of view.
talk by countries with less or greater experience.
does it seems to you to be any place where it it really succeeded in integrating of large groups from an extra@-@ european culture?
i look at maghreb maghreb in france, turks in germany, they are also enclaves ed.
i would not go towards radical statements.
of course, their integration is more difficult than with other waves of migration, but that does not mean that they do not integrate at all.
there was an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in france, germany, the united kingdom.
but purely police means will not work.
let us create fortress europe is illusory.
it must be overswed to integration mechanisms in european societies.
there were some mistakes here.
we need to be more demanding.
let us ask these people to learn the language, try to take over values, stop staying standing in europe and with one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family, including through marriages of convenience.
however, the imminent problem of these people be separated separated from the long-term problem their integration must be separated.
if others have failed in long-term integration, it does not mean that we must look at them how they are wning in the mediterranean.
perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come from.
and if there is an intervention in syria, which i do not think, does not mean that the country will recover overnight and you can take them back.
until solutions arise, we see fortress ses within europe.
borders have been closed, walls are being ted, border controls are being reintroduced into the schengen area.
is the european project at risk?
the european project as such no, the schengen area as built, yes.
it minimal has been quite minimal and arranging the rules, so pressure was too high on the countries where they put these migrants their foot for the first time.
that is to say we are moving freely there, but everyone is with their problems.
this cannot be the case in the face of such a wave, because some countries are not coping it.
when there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long term much is not changing not change.
after the attacks in france, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the eu than we had last year.
it is a wave of public emotion that is instalinstalled in both senses.
and it is so unstable from one week to the next that you cannot make decisions on it.
we have a lot of talking, many rebellion statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virate.
and then you have the dramatic case of the droecned child in turkey and public opinion is emotional.
after public emotion emotion passed, we will back to the reasons why we have created this area, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
this is the real single european market.
and i do not believe that europeans will give up this principle of liberton movement.
there will be other rules is something else.
schengen is now like an animal created during another age and was not adapted to the situation situation.
romania how has it played so far in this crisis?
as a small country, which believes that, if it shoit sokes in the eye and soles its ears, the subject is disappearing.
faced with the reality of migrant waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that this is not your problem as a small country.
that is what we have done, it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh country of the eu.
you are not, not play at large country level.
large countries come up with solutions for the whole of the eu, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
as poland has done.
on the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that romanians' appetite for schengen will fall greatly.
president iohannis says it is may good that we have not already entered.
so we move from disperair entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
there is, of course, a risk if romania and bulgaria enter schengen that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
this does not mean that it is a reason to stop entering schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
romania will be part of schengen and schengen will exist, but transformed into the sense to which external borders will become joint responsibility, will be single rules for accepting migrants, single rules of deportation for non-asylum seekers, single rules for countries considered safe.
the ukrainian president said that after russia moved its attention to syria to ukraine, no one died.
is there a link between the two phobreaks, a game of russia?
russia behabehaves frustrated power.
she believes being a great power means making the americans and europeans confused.
from this point of view, yes, there is a link.
without the military and financial effort of the putin regime, the assad regime would probably have long collapsed.
and it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the islamic state.
a two years has been a battle between the assad regime and moderate secular and muslim militias supported by the gulf and western countries.
then the islamic state stood, and now we no longer know whether we want the assad regime to fall.
russia was able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
it creates phooutbreak of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
but you are only a great power if you also have solutions.
the game at off-side is just a strategy to win time.
putin is likely waiting for bids to be made to press the butons to resolve the situation.
offers do not come because the world is not convinced that it can solve one way or other issues he also creates.
but i disagree with the theories that say that these people are driven by an invisible hand.
let us not see a little stronger than it is.
ec buton will appear soon
millions of facebook users have become used to the button " like ", and now representatives of the social networking network are preparing another opposite, that of " dislike. "
on tuesday, mark zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on his account that this button would be available soon, the new york times reported on blog.
zuckerberg made it clear that the " dislike " button would show a nuance of what a user feels rather than just an option.
however, his announcement raised that facebook could become a less friendly place.
zuckerberg noted that he wants to avoid a time when someone posts an important event in life on his account, while someone else will give " dislike. "
network users, who have have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long been calling for the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
mark zuckerberg also said it is not very comfortable for people to give " like " current events such as the refugee crisis, or to a death of a family member.
" you may not feel comfortable to give like that post, " the facebook representative pointed out.
the version of a new button on facebook has not been well received by everyone.
" there is already enough hatred on facebook and on social networking networks, " atiq haneef of afghanistan commented on the new york times facebook page, where the article on the subject was posted.
" i will give' dislike the the' dislike' button, " he added.
roger anderson, an atlanta microbiologist, claimed there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to differ on facebook.
debra aho williamson, social media analyst at emarketer, noted it is hard to imagine that a one button can send a complex range of negative emotions.
moreover, she says, the election campaign in america is approaching, and the " dislike " button would create a complete disaster.
only 70 refugees entered hungary within 24 hours
hungary accepted only 70 migrants on tuesday, a hand of thousands come en masse to its southern border with serbia serbia, government adviser gyorgy bakondi announced.
hungary declared a state of emergency later in day in two counties along the serbian border due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing and announcing that it would build a fence on its border with romania, the dpa recalls.
the move drew a sudden reaction from serbia.
just yesterday, they said that they would the border logo for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to apply for asylum.
" as you see, this is totally different, " said serbian minister for refugees aleksandar vulin.
before imposing new immigration legislation, a record 5,809 migrants entered hungary on sunday, police announced on monday.
more more than 170,000 immigrants from the middle east and africa entered hungary from serbia in 2015.
many avoid being registered and are trying to reach the west, especially in germany.
the " new " county council headquarters is to typical.
two builders, in insolvency
the massive investments made here in recent years to move the institution is to come down because they have been stopped several times.
two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
street council headquarters vasile alecsandri ri will end up down alone.
a year and a half after work on strengthening and re-functionalising the building should have been completed, work has reached a half.
a final stage in the age of the building was consumed last days, when the national challenge resolution council (cnsc) rejected a complaint by the firm that wanted to take over a contract to conduct the technical project for work still to be executed.
the initial project was drafted by hinx romcatel sa.
following the insolvency entry of the builder and disruption of work, negotiation procedures began without the publication of a participation announcement with x romcatel, the company to update the technical project and then a new tender for work be held.
" however, the negotiations did not end with a contract, with the cj assessing that the proposed form have put the institution at a disadvantage, " setrazvan timofciuc, represented public relations within the ccup.
the cj decision to break off direct negotiations was attacked in court by hinx romcatel.
the spanish court sent a complaint to the cnsc, which rejected it as a tarar.
that does not mean, however, that the cj can start searching for another design.
hinx romcatel has the opportunity to attack the cnsc decision at the appeals court, only after a final ruling of can it be considered finding another design.
thus, work to strengthen the building could resume at the earliest next year.
our intention is to restart work as soon as possible.
in principle, restoring the technical project should not take a long time, but we must reach a contract.
" we are waiting to see whether or not the cnsc decision will be attacked, " timofciuc said.
work on strengthen the former headquarters of the police quaestestbegan in 2011.
a first work contract was terminated in april 2012, after work of 4.5 million lei had been done.
the tender was resumed, with the contract going to moldovconstruct sa.
the firm, however, entered into insolvency, and that contract terminated after 1.5 million lei payments were made.
work has so far been carried out about 50%.
initially, consolidation, re-functionalisation and mansardare of the building had been assessed at 7.7 million lei.

tourist's beania
a cluj tourist family came to iasi to visit him, but the trip ended in a bitter promise.
after the experience experienced,, my wife neither do not want to calm ever in your city any more.
without wanting, they run up into the erroneous flous information of disfeeling rapt controllers and' bonus, by a fine' like that is-called law'.
husbands arrived in iasi a few days ago, overnight at a centricentre hotel and called for tourist leaflets.
they also received a frighance in which ratp trails were passed.
" armed " with these maps, husbands visited istanbul.
but two days ago, in copou, they wanted to reach palas mall.
as it was not ticket tones in the station near copou park, they were based on hungry printed information: that they could take sms ticket.
no one has told them that this service no longer exists.
horhorly confident, they climbed to a bus and tried to send sms after instructions from the leaant.
unfortunately for them, a team of ratp controllers has emerged.
they said there has not been the service for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it has been cancelled.
where should i know what has been written in the local media, with i coming an evening before visiting the city?
i spoke to the controllers, i explained to their situation, they said they did not care, that is not their job.
the attitude has been very defiant.
they said that all they can do is put ourselves one fine instead of 2 (myself and wife).
" i paid, i did not want to shoout my day to standing at the gendarmerie and making statements there! " ovidiu tells.
in conclusion, the family was amended because of erroneous information from the leaant and controllers who' applied the law to blood. "
that is not right, and i have made a complaint to ratp iasi to recover my money.
it is not a of money, there are not excessively many, but the point is that i felt mistaken.
ghinion for rapists in vaslui.
they had an accident and remained under preventive arrest
the trial of seven rapists from vaslui has since yesterday moved to the iasi appeals court.
emerging magistrates tried the first trial at an unpublic meeting in which the seven young people accused of knocking an 18-year-old called for circulation.
before the actual start of the trial session, one of the emerging judges whom the file had been distributed, viorel munanu been distributed, submitted a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
the magistrate activated the vaslui court by summer summer this year, where he was president of the ale section president, who who on april 9th, acknowledged a challenge made by four of the indictees, having them to be placed under house arrest.
the dossier is currently being tried by a complete that includes magistrates that ical mythum and geta sandu.
earlier, in the dossier he formulated a abstention and judge dan an ton, on the grounds that his daughter is in a relationship with competition with one of the rapists' lawyers.
the two judges decided that rapists at the vaslui still remain under preventive arrest.
ti clouds will remain imprisoned for at least another 30 days, when the jude pers re-discuss the possibility of putting them to freedom.
the presiding judge will take place at the iasi appeals court on 6 october.
before getting to the iasi appeals court, the duba carrying rapists from vaslui was involved in an accident in the pacsta neighbourhood, car entering iasi through the belt.
autoutilitara iveco with which the seven rapists were transported hit a volks wagen car flowching from stradela sing, and the driver tried to stay to the left.
duba circulates from an end of the pacwishes.
the car entered iasi there there because penitentiary administration employees preferred the route from vaslui to iasi to heat, then on the bypass road.
they thus shortened the road by a few kilometres.
immediately after the impact, the arrest escort called for another shipment to take over detainees.
shortly, a car was sent at the accident site from the iasi maximum safety penitentiary, which took over the seven detainees and transported them to the appeals court.
following the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
to transfer them to the other duba, guards surrounded the back part of the mands, and arrests came to speed, two each.
" the incident was not reported to the police, because the do ua car drivers understood amicably about the damage to be paid for, " chief commissioner madalin taranu of the ipj.
large migration
romania is neither, nor will it be, ready for to come.
but is europe?
i say this from the outset, clearly and clear: the 7000 refugees they should and should naturalise to romania represent, in itself, an insignificant but huge number compared to the ability of the romanian state to manage such a project.
for romania, even the voluntary rate proposed by bucharest, in the amount of around 1 500 soul, far far beyond our good intentions of solidarity with the european union expressed in recent months.
certainly, if those migrants really accept to settle themselves in our locations, the chances of integrating them quickly into romanian society are extraordinarily small.
i am convinced that they will be the first to lose patience.
paralysed sed by interdiaspora and paralysed by a venal political class, the romanian state proves itself mired in all areas.
the failure to integrate gypsies is just a trivial example.
in addition, governments of any colour have not been able to absorb european funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, ensure decent healthcare, raise the stakes on the street, create honourably paid, or retain their own young generation at home.
why would refugees be established in another country from which they are running?
but what produces great deal mirrors is particularly the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
we first come ahead to the rebellion fatishness of the strong states of the eu, which show the utmost generosity when it comes to sharing misbles with smaller countries.
then then comes the frimus hypocrisy of romanians who, although they have millions of relatives cattered everywhere around the world, still do not accept the other - from another language, from another religion, another blood.
perhaps for fear of steal his careleaves the national being.
after, there is also hypocrisy of many migrants who, although they only invoke the horrors of war as a reason of departure, do not accept any other destination for exodus than germany or northern countries.
however, not all refugees are syans, and in pakistan there is no war.
also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is examined can only be mocked.
the causes must be eliminated, some argue and, at squstrictly on the book of of political correctness, they demanding peace and investment for migrants' countries of origin.
but there is peace in romania and it even enters, from time to time, some foreign capital into the national economy -- but this does not prevent tens of thousands of romanians from leaving their country every year.
why are they leaving?
in this crisis, the european union has been revealed to us that anchiloate construction torn apart apart and overcome by the situation.
we deplore the fact that romania is unable to invent a country project, but here the eu does not have any plan for the future either.
and improvisation and threats are not helping nothing.
what is the eu still using, then, if the only advantage romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be called into question because of waves of refugees crossing borders as through cheese?
at some point, the war in syria will end.
not the crisis of migrants, however.
in the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc.. will push millions of desperate migrants, from asia and, in particular, from africa, towards a better life.
with such politicians, romania is neither, nor will ever be ready for what to come.

two brothers in the tomesti have swallowed somwards.
were taken to hospital
two 9-year-old children, 11, respectively from tomesti, brothers, have swallowed up several diamepam pills.
they found pastileries at the home and took them out of curiosity.
their mother was treatment treatment and medicines were not hidden.
the children were urgently taken to the " saint maria " hospital in iasi.
they are in stable condition, as doctors say.
exclusively: a meeting that wholeheartedly ruyour you.
20 years she received a courageous but: biological parents
lost in hospital under unclear conditions, in the denial of the 1990s, when it had only two months of life, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in italy, at the same years as adoption was vaaguely, a young young woman woman, now a blonand beautiful girl, remet the day before yesterday in iasi with biological parents in a village county.
the crina will last these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in palermo thought to give their loved loved daughter a stunning and courageous present: a visit to romania, to iasi, to know her unclear past.
the " iasi newspaper, " which witnessed efforts search for the origin family after several very vague indices, witnessed these meetings that basically rup your heart.
according to reporters, the emotions of the moment, statements by those involved, their reactions are downright moving and overwhelming.
the crin's story begins 20 years ago in unsty town, when it was only two months months.
then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to hospital in the city.
there understandunderstandings between parents at home, and the mother had to go on the home.
he decided to keep in front and me to send me from home.
he has stopped girl, and then i have not known anything before.
" when i learned he was in hospital, it was too late, " grirata alina, the biological mother of the daughter, remembers.
crina was admitted admitted with her grandmother to pascani city hospital, and also then the daughter's father, costica balcan, left for work in alexandria, teleorman county.
their lives were to split permanently.
they stop finding crina at hospital
after his internory, the drc's father left for work in another capacity, and returned six months later.
meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the iasi hospital, and the father, when he returned, no longer found it.
i think it was almost nine months since the girl was in hospital.
" she have thought she was abandoned, " she tells an granddaughter of the family.
due to financial problems, grandmother was unable to come with crina to iasi, and the girl remained in doctors' care.
as no one has more interested in the fate of the child throughout the time, she was taken up by the directorate-general for social assistance and the protection of the iasi child, who then gave it to care for the plastic centre in bucium.
there were years when abandonment ment and adoption were lanily regulated from romania today.
at the bucium centre was found by italy's salvadore and his wife, a couple from palermo who wanted to have their child but failed to succeed.
they fell in love with blonduta crina, and some time later she was to move with them permanently to italy.
the cut had already done nearly two years as adoption formalities lasted.
when we saw the crina, i felt it was before us.
" as if my wife had given him his life, " tells us smiling rescuadore, the foster father, as he caught in his palm the firava hand of the face.
in the country, crina's parents alina and costica continued their searches searches separately, each it could.
the father asked the rugsty authorities, but received no answer where his child could be.
police then told him that they may be dead, but in iasi parents found out what really happened to of them.
when i sought her here, they told me in court that she was going to italy, to palermo.
and the conditions to look for it have not had any more.
we asked to god to be good.
i thought of it in all the years that have passed, but there were not possibilities to humur, to find it.
" it's hard, " ttears tells the drc's biological mother in our eye.
but, even though the years have passed, rugsty parents have not been forgotten.
in italy, salvadore and wife explained to the fhe comes from and that her past connects her with romania.
i was small when i learned.
i think we were five or six years old.
i reacted as a copy, i was curious.
" i wanted to know my parents in romania, " confconfdelighted delighted crina.
and her dream was to become a reality.
in march of this year, chief commissioner romica ichim, director of the iasi regional centre for prevention, evaluation and anti-drug advice, was contacted by an italian knowledge italy, explained explained salvadore's desire to find the drc's biological family.
and the searches started only from a name.
after our request from our partners in italy, we started the first steps.
we received only one name, the coastal balcan, then located, rugsty.
i i had a job with the city hall there, and i was able to ask whether there was by the name he was received.
they then gave me some indications, only that the person found was not the one wanted.
" it took up to about a month ago to find the biological father of the face, " chief commissioner romica ichim explains.
in all, more than three months took the authorities to find costiand alina, especially as everyone were living in another city.
we began steps somewhere in march, and in june-july we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
" then we established that a first meeting to take place in september, " romica ichim added.
at last weekend, alina and costica first saw their face lost at the chambers of the hospital in iasi 20 years ago.
the father, moved, could barely hold his tears and his hands stopped passed up.
it is barely changing a few words to those around.
a week before the meeting, it could not even sleep.
it was also emotional, awish.
" to see your child after so many years, it's something, " says her grandson, who also with a rugsty costicoast.
drc meeting with biological mother and brother
in talks with him, who is due to study at a well-ranked university in italy, costica balcan told him, among other things, that if he once wants to return to him in the village to come quiet: he can give him some sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and set up a household.
my mother is also emotional, complains, and she hardly believes that this can happen to them.
i am very emotional.
i did not think that could happen.
i saw such cases on television, i everything thinking these years, i hoped, but i did not think i could be the case.
these are very great emotions.
if he could forgive me.
i hope that we will visit other in the future.
" i hope we can keep a touch, " says says great tears in obraji alina, the drc's mother, as he keeps closely in his hands a servetde.
in him he conceals his tears, happiness, because he will soon see him them after so kind as time.
on the other hand, crina, which will last in just a few days' time this month, 20 20, is trying to reassure himself like as an emotional child.
he does not know what to expect, but sketout a vague idea of her biological parents.
he think they are young people, but now before the meeting are trying to gather their thoughts, because he has a great deal to say, but nothing to reproach.
my parents are two mothers and two fathers.
but it is ultimately my parents who have increased me.
it will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
" i hope i have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say, " we nous confessed.
first family meeting in iasi
in the unification square, under the sky of the beginning of autumn, the rugsty family once again unites its destiny to them in palermo.
the crina is 20 years ago, finish high school, according to the italian school model, but it can begin a new chapter with alina and costica, her biological parents.
we no longer divide their borders or countries, but just a barrier: language.
above, with an translator, an italian local owner in central madeira, easily passed.
those who managed to make this meeting possible say that this is the first event of its kind to done, and that in future, if the opportunity arises, they will do so.
it is the first event of its kind to be organised, by such an emotional load, and i am pleased to be a success.
we at the centre have different activities, and we are often associated as an institution that deals only with consumer people, people dependent on drugs.
but we are trying to give society something good back.
" if i have asked for such an evenof food, i will do so with great dear, " says smiling romica ichim, director of the iasi regional centre for prevention, evaluation and anti-drug counselling.
behind him, the balcan family, with crine in the middle, departments away by aches.
i am understandable: they have much to say to each other.
a ceasefire ce on the leg yesterday in the psd.
everyone shols their soul
camps in the's supreme branch ended a gunceasefire on the leg.
after successive rounds of talks, held from friday to sunday, the first being the most tense, psd leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
pressure by the party's executive president, liviu dragnea, to present a united position, the emerging social democrats will send him a whole list of potential candidates to party's positions.
far from over, the internal war in the party appears to have taken only a break to allow combatants to shoot their soul.
dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
it has sent a very simple and very current message at the current conditions: try to find a solution as not to jeopardise the party.
on 3 october, we have elections in the party.
all functions will be made available to those who wish them.
" until then, we remain in the existing structure, " said acting mayor mihai chirica.
the two days of talks at the weekend led only to the conclusion that no certain was determined.
in the october elections, fierce competition is expected for chairman of the psd county branch.

added to this could como schitu leads mayor mihai mihalache.
one option under consideration is also the candidacy of psd county illors leader cristian stanciu, should lupu no longer join the race, with party sources saying he is not interested in office.
the only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of former branch leader, mayor gheorghe nichita.
the list of candidates is open.
under status, applications can be submitted, including on election day, and would not surprise anyone if it were to happen.
" what important thing is that we remain united, and we will stay after october 3rd, when we have a new executive office, a new permanent county office and all new leadership structures, " catea added.
until the internal elections are held, the leadership of the psd county branch will be secured by victorel lupu, a close close to nichita and stanciu.
lupu, however, is on leave until 29 september, with preparation for the elections actually effectively to be secured by the branch executive secretary, county adviser mihail popescu, who in cold relations with the nichita camp.
i contacted phone phone, cristian stanciu praised the talks in recent days as leading to " a partial consensus. "
there is broad readiness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
a partial consensus was reached to support a unitary team to deal with the county.
" but on the other hand, there are several variants regarding intentions to candidacy in the psd iasi presidency, with the list remaining open, " stanciu commented.
exit judge refuses ds rapists vaslui file on grounds of competition
the seven young people in vaslui county convicted rape are today arriving to the iasi appeals court.
vasluans ans sentenced to sentences of five years and eight months and eight years, and four months will today present their arguments about them put at large, after the basic court, judge ia vaslui, established their imprisonment immediately after the ruling handed down.
the file came at the appeals court late last week, with magistrologist dan anton submitting a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
anton cited that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer bogdan luca, is his daughter's competition, lawyer dana anton.
luca defends silviu ovidiu burada, who has received the highest sentence in the dossier.
as motivated ruling judges
late last week, the magistrstrates of presiding of vaslui who condemned the seven young people motivated the sentence.
motivmotivation for the judge talks about the defiant reaction of indictees, but also of those who supported them, saying that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
" the court notes that after judicial control is placed in preventive extent, the restrictive of freedom but not deprivmeasure of freedom, under the impact of the attitude of defendants, their families and local supporters, was felt a strong sense of indignation at the local and national community that people accused of serious facts are being tried under a less restrictive extent, " the motivation of the vasjudge said.
magistrates also also dismantled the main defence of the seven indictees who during the trial cited that the girl they raped would not be the " door to church. "
" the court understates that the moral of the injured person person is irrelevant, which indictees wanted to highlight through the appliances they formulated, as a person's's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext, " motivalso noted.
corbyn, brexit and future of europe
for economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades cannot no longer to the same way in the coming years.
until saturday, probably little world knew in romania who jeremy corbyn was.
even today, after he became the new leader of the uk labour party, many wonder to what extent it can affect us the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
jeremy corbyn is the most radical clumtist leader of the post-war labour.
marxist said, the anti-monarchist (once asked tony blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family of buckingam palace), a ferooce anti-american and a sympathiser of vladimir putin (was otherwise regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel " russia today "), and hizizbollah and terrorist terrorist movements, he he wants britain britain britain weapons weapons
for corbyn, who considered at the time the murder of osama bin laden as a real tragedy, the denounced is almost preferable to the united states.
based on all populist demagogues, corbyn, of course, has miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
things such as those he said and promised and tsipras in greece until it gave a chest with the real world and economic ities.
the new labour leader's economic programme provides, among other things, for massive renationalisation and money printing as a solution for financing development projects for covering very generous social benefits.
of course, some might wonder why the solution to printing money is not unanimously adopted around the world, we would then have global overall prosperity! but who would prevent itself from such details further.
of course, we can tax blood bankers you you become some kind of service enemies of the left, but as far as has been seen so times in the past, not only in the former communist states or ecuador or venezuela, but also in france, at the beginning of the mandates of mitterand and hollande.
the additional sums are quickly swallowed by generous, uncover cover promises made by populist demagogues.
as margaret thatcher was well out, " the problem of socialism is that at some point others's money ends. "
few give jeremy corbyn real chance ever to reach prime minister.
in the early 1980s, another radical left-wing leader, michael feio, who was not as extremely belief anyway as the fresh party leader, failed lamentably in the elections.
and then there is still a migrant workers' class in britain, in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
and trade unions were sensibly more influential than they were now.
at a time of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant as the labour as whole, and extensive automatiations have made a massive for highly qualified qualified workforce in the industry, corbyn's rhetoric has a limited call.
but even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
in its latest financial number, believes corbyn's election increases the chances of the brem, namely britain to leave the eu.
the new labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the union.
in the eyes of the radical left in brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed austerity on the poor.
when you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis rocking the foundations of the eu is reaching an explosive mix.
and not just for britain.
but if the british decide following the referendum, which should take place by 2017, to leave the union losing symbolic capital for the entire european project and the deep winds created within it by the euro crisis, and now is of refugees, between north and south, between east and west, are leaving room for scenarios in the most worrying.
all the more so because for a whole series of member states, london was an counterector on the franco-german axis (in which berlin is increasingly becoming the dominant actor).
admittedly, british business, the city, are strong lawyers of the country's remains in the eu.
but today's europe is no longer the one of the past.
there is many resentment, which is growing in intensity as as these weeks.
the problem is that brussels, we recently had a sample in jean clude junker's speech, is increasingly tends to take major decisions over the head of the vast majority of member states consulting with only a few european powers, primarily germany.
this this is at a time when electoral support for the anti-@-@ system, anti-immigration formations which are, the same time, also eurosceptic is growing dramatically throughout the continent.
in other words, the emotional climate with negative-charged has reached higher than ever in the past.
hence the conclusion that the financial times draws when assessing the chances of bre.
the pro-eu option is based on a cold calculation that leaves from national interest.
if voters make the cerebral decision, then britain will remain in the eu.
but corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
eastern europe can, however, be significantly affected by such major developments.
especially if, as expected, we see greater integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and on the outirirts of interest and the decision-making process in europe.
corbyn, tsipras and syriza in greece, podemos in spain, even bernie sanders in the united states feed their populist rhetoric from frustrations in hostile-ental societies.
for economic and demographic causes, the prosperity it has enjoyed in recent decades, generous social benefits, cannot continue any the the same in the coming years.
under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the euro area - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that have only taken into of integrationpolitical ambitions, not the capacity and readiness of the peoples and governments of europe to respond to such challenges, turbulence on the continent, internal tensions in the eu will rise in intensity and may seriously affect romania's situation.
and it is difficult to exclude something in terms of possible scenarios.
the question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
constantin brancusi, the god taran.
rockefeller:' how can i help you?'
brancusi:' takes also matthe workshop!'
the great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to get the famous, hear about him around the world.
however, something famous is behind his something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for life success.
that something also has a name.
it call' circumvent'.
what to write about constantin brancusi?
what remains to be said, in fact?
his figure appeared on banknotes.
and recently, a known bank in romania hired an actor to play him in a advertising customer.
cheese cheese produces and supply money nearly 60 years after it is no longer among us.
in romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards bearing his name.
in fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
and when it walout out with odrasla, he hears the following instructions:' we go to the park to brancusi'.
the country is imwn by its statues.
there are few romanian figures whose works is known to so people, from children to the elderly.
brancusi's infiltrate capacity is a huge one.
the communists communists failed to extirdes out of romania's memory and culture.
its quotations afer the internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of like them and share.
and then, again, what would still be to say, in writing about this man?
viewed from the lot of books and articles trying to reconstitute his destiny, brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, which is totally unlikely.
you know, there are those people who tell you that if you did not have the good fortune to be born in any large city and a family as well as possible, your chances of success in life are almost invalid.
brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
and perhaps it would be a key here.
perhaps the forthcoming text should start from this.
with a sentence, however detestable they are.
look at the success creative stories, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and tv.
look carefully at the figure of this man.
do you want to know how he succeeded in life, how, today, by he heard a whole world?
it is simple.
he has worked all his life to be someone.
that is what it did.
constantin brancusi is born on 19 february 1876, in hobita, a small village in the common sani fish, gorj county, at the of the carpathians.
he is the fifth child of maria and radu nicolae brancusi.
although he came from a affoff peasant family, brancusi leads a modest life, but one of he would reap the benchmarks that will guide his late artistic vision.
recalling childhood and places he grew up, the artist was to confess, at a meeting with petre tutea, paris in 1933: " in then life was beautiful and harmonious. "
for millennia, people had gone, happhappy, a patriarchal life.
everything was cally from one seasseason to another.
and do you know why things have changed?
the great city's civilisation has reached us.
brancusi's childhood, however, was far from a idillic one.
one of the moment in these first years of life is highly revealing for the combination of purity and violence that characterised his future of sculptsculptor years in his home town.
the timing is produced in the work " cheese. a biography " by alexander buican.
in 1879, constantin brancusi was 3 years old.
in the autumn of that year, when tumed " in cazan, " following those who samplst the liquidid to see if the process is place properly, cheese are catching a moment of general unattention.
it fills its 50m with tuica and drink on neroppersons.
it falls into almost sleinstantaneously.
the first people see only a few minutes later.
my mother panic, then in hysteria, believing his son died.
late, when the father, radu, returns from alive accompanied by greies, he he sees from away the the desperate signs of those who much waiting for him at their mouth.
the spending immediately turns into the jale.
the father is already thinking of the funeral.
however, someone finds it's good summonbaba aba brandusa, dos and cheese servemen.
cheese verifies children's respirath, then puts them under balega ega, gathered from the stroar.
the hard child child.
the world applauds.
while the boy is left to sleep on his bey, joy, the greing spending continues with even more force.
the next day, father and son meet through livada.
radu brancusi puts putting constantin to gather some nunuts and bring them.
the father lays es his child his head down and, with the noields brought by the boy, he beats him to in mind.
