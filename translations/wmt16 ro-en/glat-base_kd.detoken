un chief says no military solutions in syria
secretary-general ban ki-moon says his response to russia's military support for syria is that " there is no military solution " to the conflict lasting for nearly five years, and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
the un chief has again urged all parties, including the divided un security council to unite and support negotiations in order to find a political solution.
ban said at a conference wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent countries present in the council-the us, russia, china, england and france -- on the general assembly's ministerial session to discuss syria.

ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity shown when they managed reach an agreement on iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in syria.
8 poll figures showing donald trump has a real chance
some tried to label him as a " lip-flop " politician.
others called him a joke.
and others wait for implosion.
but regardless of how some republicans are trying to remove donald trump from the polls' top, it has not worked (still).
ten of the past 11 national polls have shown that donald trump leads by two figures, and some are starting to seriously seriously what this means for the chances of appointing the real estate mogul.
of course, it is still premature.
none of this says trump will win the race to nominthe republicrepublics.
pundits shows that during the same period in 2011, rick perry's advancement was taking place to herman cain in polls polls, but of them won in any state in the nomination race.
and the reasons why it would fight hard in the general elections are numerous.
but outside groups such as jeb bush's super cap and the conservative conservative economic club for growth admit trump's power and begin to support it with money.
we continue still present to you some figures in recent polls suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just something passing passing:
figures indicating support for the trump returned to 180 degrees.
just before donald trump announced its candidacy in mid-june, a poll by the university of monmouth shows that only two out of 10 republicans had a positive opinion of real estate mogul.
by mid-july, the percentage moved bed to 40%.
in early august, it was 52 per cent.
currently, six out of 10 republichave a favourable view of donald trump.
about three out of 10 say they have a negative view.
these figures remain.
a poll conducted last week by quinnipiac in iowa concluded 60% of the region's republicans a favourable view of trump.
two-thirds of gop voters would be happy if trump won the race for race.
in a poll conducted by cnn / orc last week, 67% of the republican said they would be " exenthusiastic " or " satisfied " if trump won the race for the nomination.
only two out of 10 say they would be " upset " if the trump won the nomination race.
only ben carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as trump (43% say it would be " enthusiastic " about 40% who say the same about trump).
at closest to enthusiasm?
marco rubio, with only 21%.
on the other side, 47% of republican voters say they would " " dissatisfied or " upset " if the favourite jeb bush wins the nomination race.
most republicans do not see trump's temperature a problem.
although donald trump has been strongly criticised for his insults and his bombastic style, 52% of the national republican voters believe the real estate mogul to the right temperament to be president, according to a poll by abc news / washington post on monday.
we find the same figures in the state of iowa, where also 52% of the republicans believe trump has the right personality to be leader, according to quinnipiac's poll last week.
however, 44% believe that it does not have the personality to act effectively, and almost six out 10 independent independent say his temperament has no place at the white house, according to abc / post.
republican voters get used to the idea.
when taking the attitude of intellectuals, republican voters see trump authentic.
according to a poll conducted by cnn / orc last week, the question of who has the best chance of winning the gop nomination race, four out of 10 said trump.
the situation changed from the end of july, when four out of 10 had bet on jeb bush.
full information: in the past, gop voters have not read the future very well.
during the same period of the last elections, four out of 10 republicchose rick perry in the race for the nomination, compared from only 28% for mitt romney.
but these figures show that the majority of gop voters consider trump's campaign plausible.
even though the republicans or leated to another candidate; trump still heads everyone.
some say the divided situation is likely to contribute to trump's victory, while support against trump will split more than a dozen candidates.
but a poll in early september by the university of monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of collaboration between trump and most other republican candidates, almost always trump will receive majority support.
trump is 13 points away from carly fiorina at 14 points of marco rubio, at 15 walker points, 19 points of jeb bush and finally 33 points each from paul, john kasich and chris christie.
it is close to equality with ted cruel.
the only candidate who defeat him?
ben carson would beat businessman with 19 points in a hypotheone-one-one confrontation.
most of donald trump's supporters say they decided.
a new poll conducted by cbs / nyt on tuesday shows more than half of the voters supporting trump say they do not change their ballots.
obviously, much can happen about this and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leaves the door open to the possibility of changing its option.
however, trump's most important adversary currently neurosurgeant ben carson, but voters are twice likely likely say they decided to vote with trump.
six out of 10 republicans say they agree with trump p immigration immigration.
since donald trump appointed immigrants from mexico " rapists " in his opening speech of his campaign two months ago, immigration was the central topic in the campaign for 2016.
some are concerned that trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between key hispanici voters and the republican party and harm rebranding efforts.
but according to a poll conducted by abc / post on monday, six of 10 republicans say they agree with trump on immigration immigration.
so, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, how, doland trump will remain.
frustration with the authorities reaches new colours.
donald trump and ben carson are now supported by nearly half of republican voters, largely because because of their status as dissidents.
according to the poll conducted by abc / post on monday, six out of 10 republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the expense of someone with government experience.
people are also upset washington.
a poll conducted two weeks ago in iowa by des moines register / bloomberg shows that three out of four iowa republicans are frustrated by the performance of the republican ans in congress, 54% were " dissatisfied " and 21% " nerand colome. "
jeremy corbyn makes debut at prime ministry's questions
since his election, the start of corbyn in pmqs has long been awaited
the new leader of the labour party, jeremy corbyn, will make his debut at prime prime ministry questions questions first facing david cameron.
mr corbyn will ask the first of the six questions he has the right shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be closely examined by the media and labour parliamentarians.
under weekly appearances, he called for " less theatre and more deeds. "

corbyn's decision not to perform national anthem draws attention
a spokesman for mr corbyn said that he' respectfully kept silent' and recognised the' heroism of british air forces in the battle of england'.
but a member of the fantotom cabinet of mr corbyn, owen smith, told the two's newsnight broadcast by the bbc that he would have urged the labour leader shocking the national anthem " regardless of his belief that monarchy should be abolished.
around a dozen ministers from the fanantom cabinet refused to be part of mr corbyn's leading team, arguing by differences of opinion on the economy, defence and foreign, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party backed him as a leader.
bbc political correspondent robin brant says policy differences " come together " in the labour party after the appointment of mr corbyn regarding his position towards the european union and the benefits limit.
mr corbyn said at the tuc conference that the labour party would make changes that will fully eliminate the idea of limitation.
a few hours later, mr smith, the minister for labour and pensions, stated that the party is very clear' in the exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the cap' level from 26,000 lira to 23.000 lira.
mr corbyn will be the fifth labour leader facing david cameron to gallery over the last decade since taking assumed the helm of the conservative party.
the labour leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, says that he has ideas' from foreign sources' for questions to ask mr cameron and that he has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
parliament member islington north said pmqs involves too high high level of confrontation and would refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging instead focusing instead on serious issues such as the poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
mr corbyn said that angela eagle, the finance minister, will hold place in pmqs when he cannot participate - for example, when mr cameron moves abroad.
he also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying that he addressed addressed chamber of deputies president john bercow to discuss this.
in 2005, when he took the lead, mr cameron said that he wanted to give up the political style punpunand judy' often associated with pmqs, but he acknowledged a few years later that he failed in do so.
since the first transmission, in 1990, pmqs has been considered a key barometer of the rationing of a leader, way he he heads the chamber of deputies and its position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics say it has become a caricature and that it needs deep reform.

thanasi kokkinakis backed by tennis australia president steve healy
thanasi kokkinakis would deserve praise praised and not criticised for his behaviour.
thanasi kokkinakis has been the collateral victim in the " storm " around his friend nick kyrgios, and his behaviour rather deserves words of praise and not criticise in the opinion of tennis australia president steve healy.
kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called " special ks, " was unpleasantly dragged in the light of the spotlight by the scandalous derapage kyrgios towards stan wawrinka at the montreal masters tournament.
in a ffqualification match played shortly after, in the cinc, the seat referee of the seat he had to intervene twice to dissplit kokkinakis and his ryan harrison opponent opponent, after which harrison said, " " wawrinka should have put the ground gios kyrgios.
although it was seen last time making a powst rocket after crampe musculare and missed a possible us open tournament, upset richard gasquet, kokkinakis was firmly defended by healy.
the teenager is currently in glasgow, where he battwith sam groth for second place individually after bernard tomic in the davis cup semifinal against england.
" one i feel strong is that, in my opinion, thanasi has been attracted a little to conflict, " healy said.
the truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because accusing crampe in us, but it is not the first player to break a rocket from frustration with himself and know thanasi enough to know he would not proud of that.
but let us be serious, he has been ined extremely well in quite challenging situations in the harrison us and so on, and i think it deserves a great deal of trust.
it has an extraordinary team, it has a great family together, and i think it has been unfairly treated.
he is a very mature year-old-young man, he is working hard and integrated into the team, he has had no conflict with with the other players, he is very respected in the west, it is working hard, he is in an excellent form, he is a very very balanced and mature man and i think he deserves to be tried solely on his qualities and defects.
healy also supported the decision not to consider account kyrgios for the important reat match, which begins friday, and described the " joint decision " as the most suitable for all, but supported the return of canberra native in the long term to the team.
" first, we want the team to focus fully on the remaining match and not to think at all about the controversy around [kyrgios], " healy said.
and i think nick moved up very quickly, as people such as federer and murray said, he mataway under the eyes of the public and has made some terrible mistakes and it deserves to be criticised, but we are trying to support it, trying to help him understand the consequences of his facts and and i needs a time when he is not at the attention attention so that it good good both.
elections 2016: hillary clinton's advantage to bernie sanders has halved half in national polls.
former secretary of state hillary clinton still has a two-figure advantage in the democratic national candidacy race, but senator bernie sanders wins ground.
clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while sanders is second with 27% (up up from 17%).
vice-president joe biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15% of democratic voters.
at least five months before the primary election start, the majority of democratic voters say it is too early to say they decided on the candidate they will support.
but clinton's supporters are stronger in their election than supporters of other candidates.
compared of the poll cbs news last month, clinton lost ground in a number of demographic demographic groups, while sanders won several per cent.
clinton maintains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has diminished.
support among men has been reduced considerably and sanders is only 5 points away.
clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now on equality with sanders.
however, clinton is still in odds among elderly voters.
last month, clinton stands outside sanders with two figures, among liberals, but sanders now has a slight 5-point advantage in this group.
about half of democratic voters at the national level say they would enthusically support clinton if she chose to run on behalf of the party.
a quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
six per cent would not support it.
perhaps unsurprising, the likelihood of clinton's current supporters will be enthusiastic about her choice is high.
opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support clinton -- only about a quarter would enthusienthusiastically support it.
while 48% of democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support clinton, the number of republican voters who the same about first, donald trump (35%) is lower.
when clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has adequate experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and is the best candidate for this post (10%).
clinton's supporters also mention her association with bill clinton (9%).
agreement on these aspects and eligibility is also mentioned.
as the vice-president considers a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of democratic voters would like to see it in the race -- although one third believe he should not run.
on the question of the second option for the party representative, democratic voters mostly call biden.
of clinton's supporters, more than half say biden would be the second option, well before sanders.
if biden decides not to run in the democratic party race, hillary clinton's advantage of sanders is growing from 20 points with biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of democratic voters consider clinton the best likely to winning the general elections; but the figures dropped from 78% they were last month.
biden is second, however, but the percentage he is most eligible has increased.
however, when asked what is most important for an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
as last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered by these voters as unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well as regards some key characteristics towards their party's primary voters.
the majority of voters see clinton, sanders and biden as integration and trust and with solid leaders qualities.
biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity, clinton clinton strength is the leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not think h. clinton is integrate and reliable, twice as many as those who say so about sanders (15%), but 27% have no opinion of it on that.
democratic voters also generally believe the three, clinton, sanders and biden, have the same ideologies as they.
on all these issues, around a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion of sanders.
how questions persist persist about the use of a personal email address and a server by hillary clinton when she was secretary of state, the majority of democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject and say say she did not affect their general opinion on the candidate.
however, things are different among the us public.
half of the americans are now unhappy with its explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
public opinion was divided in march on march, shortly after the issue came to light.
most americans say the email controversy has not affected their general view on clinton, although 36 per cent say they have changed their opinion negatively.
mainly the republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their opinion on clinton on negatively.
although democratic voters consider clinton integrate and trust, this continues to raise her problems among voters a general level: only 32% consider it integrate and trust, 8% less than last month and 15% fewer than in may.
62% of voters do not consider it integrate and reliable.
at the same time, 55% of voters at national level do not consider the inclusive trump truworthy.
however, both clinton and trump white white for leadership.
of the six assessed candidates, biden, carson and bush rank the first in terms of integrity.
the number of those who consider integrers sanders higher than those who do not, however, as in carson case, many do not have an opinion of it.
the margin of error for sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
five brother members charged for killing student every 1 at baruch faculty
nearly two years after a faculty student lost his life during an initiritual ritual the pocono mountains in pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
members of the pi therhood delta psi si at new york's baruch faculty brutally attacked attacked chun " michael " deng during an initiritual in september 2013 and postponed him to hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
official sources say the victim was tied in the eye, was was back a rucsac of 14 kg full of sand and was repeatedly bullied while trying to move towards a target on frozen land.
mr deng accused headpain after then losing his knowledge.
members of the pi delta delta psi did not call the emergency number after he fainted and claim to have waited an hour before taking him to hospital, police say.
but they found the time needed to change deng's clothes, look seek its symptoms on google and contact andy meng, president of the national brotherhood to ask his advice, chief chris wagner said at a press conference.
" at this point, members began hiding personal goods and practically put the good of the brotherhood ahead of michael deng's good, " wagner said.
it could not be resuscitated and died the second day morning.
according to an autopsy report, deng suffered repeated traumas at head head, tres and coaps.
" too many families have been devastated by fr' rituals of 1970 at least one student lost his lives every year because of the rituals, " douglas fierberg, deng's family lawyer, said in a statement.
brothers brothers their members must be held accountable, and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
the grand jury of the monroe district recommended that the first five members be charged with three degree crime.
thirty-two other pieces of brotherhood, including mr meng, will also be indicted for ultraj and complicity in the murder.
" we want to hold responsibility not only the people involved but, if there is an organisation that authorised the brotherhood, official or informal, we will also hold it to account, " wagner said at a press conference tuesday.
the baruch faculty banned brobrotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representative.
that is what will happen when the federal reserve increases interest rate.
the interest rate will increase and bull market (growing market) will pory, bond profitability will increase and the economy will come into recession.
that is what we know.
what we do not know is how long it will happen and how it will last.
in the economy, history offers few entry indications over time.
after the first interest rate interest rate, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
the aggression of the federal reserve to raise interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets are response.
that is why officials from the us central bank emphasised so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start raising the interest rate but on the path of the time normalisation time.
indeed, multiple varivariable at stake.
but in the end, market players could see that all the stiitation of interest rate growth has been exaggerated.
" the first increase in the interest rate decided by the edf after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the era " cheap money, " julian jessop, chief economist at capital economics, said on a note to customers.
on the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of us interest rates to more normal but still small levels to be the seismic shock everyone seem to be afraid.
but it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
we continue to put presenting how some sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
given the situation the market has experienced in recent months, the anticipation of an rising interest rate can volatile things for some time.
at at the time, however, the impact is not so dramatic.
" it seems that there is a tendency that the profitability of capital to stagnate for 12 to 24 months after the first growth, which can once again reflect deforestation in monetary policy, " deutsche bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after edf increases.
specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has risen sharply - by around 14 per cent - moving towards increasing interest rate, quite rather invariable over the period of 250 days after (ururing average average 2.6%) after which returns to normal after 500 days days, with an return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to recent analysis published on chief veen management strategy.
deutsche has stated that the impact on actions tend to become pronounced pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits are beginning to fall.
the recession is a reality of economic life, but increasing the interest rate often contributes to it.
in the current situation, the edf is facing conditions that have not exist before and which could speed up a recession.
specifically, gross domestic product will move closer to its historic minimum point for an increase in the edf interest rate.
according to deutsche bank, out of 118 interest rate increases after 1950, only twice the nominal gdp was less than 4.5%.
even though in the second quarter of 2015, value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to atlanta.
increasing the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and raise raise question question " whether this time it is different, " deutsche said.
market players also prepared this year for an growth decision from the edf, all eyes eyes at this week's meeting of the federal open market commission, which ends on thursday.
although numerous strategists and economists believe fomc could approve an increase in interest rate at this meeting, mid-term transactions indicate only 25 25 likely.
" in our study after 1950, all cycles for interest interest rates to date have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with gdp eclipking varflows before the recession very quickly after recovery began, " the report said.
on the contrary, this has been a strange recovery slow recovery after the worst recession in the period period.
the current cycle is by far the longest expected by the edf since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months and it has reached 74 months and continues.
fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in interest rate and the printing is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
the main difference is that the impact is faster for bonds than in the case of actions when the edf amends policy.
in the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits change changing direction soon as the first growth / decline in the cycle occurs.
at the end of the cycle to increase interest interest rate, the profitability of bonds falling immediately, " deutsche said.
charles schwab strategies believe that these interest rate increases will lead to profitability to be together between short term and long term bonds, cheatiing curcur.
high-cost bonds are doing better in such an environment, although " we are still cautious of forcing profitability, " fixed income analyst at schwab, analyst athschwab, said in an analysis.
interestingly, jones is of the opinion that markets have already adapted to the expectations of edf policy.
" in addition to the power of the dollar and the estimated inflation inflation, there are several signs that the market has adapted the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy, " jones wrote.
short-term interest rates have risen, curprofitability is fairer, the spread se of average credit credit interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the edf tightens tens politics.
overall, majority operating in the us will benefit from an interest rate increase, and local products will become more attractive.
high-debt multinationals will suffer because the dollar's increase will lead to their products more expensive in the global market more expensive and their debt will be more expensive.
" history shows that " quality' stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months after an initial interest rate interest rate, " analyst goldman sachs said in a report to customers.
strong balance shefirms exceeded those with a poor balance sheet after each of interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
companies with high capital revenues and low-volatility stocks have also exceeded companies similar to lower quality quality, an average of 4 (percentage points), 3 (percentage points) respectively.
debt will become an important issue.
companies with a large percentage of fleet debt have the most to lose, goldman says.
consumers will also benefit from the dollar increase.
those who save could also benefit, although experts disagree disagree on how quickly this will happen.
bbc radio 3 a copy after fm classic, says parliament member andrew bingham
conservative mp andrew bingham criticised radio for " prostish "
he says it increasingly similar to trade opponent
he also took bbc music awards eye, saying they held brits awards.
colleague colleague damien collins attacked voice voice saying the issue was original either.

he also took the bbc music awards in, eyes last december.
the bbc music awards launched last year to to be arm under another name.
so, if you try to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that only copcopy what already exists on the market, " mr bingham said.
the bbc director-general denied the accusations, saying bbc radio 3 is well ahead of his commercial opponent in live music and public education.
i will find out anywhere about classical music i know from radio 3.
and his commitment to live music and production is not a rival.
" moreover, i think radio 3's commitment to discover new music and allocating new music and the allocation of new plays, " he said.
in the first part of this year, bbc radio 3 editor alan davey said he must do more to attract the audience from the previous period because the british have less knowledge of classical music.
but radio 3 was not the only element under the bbc logo criticised at a meeting of the culture, media and sports committee for moving the traces of its trade rivals.
conservative mp damien collins attacked the voice -- the show bought by the bbc from dutch producer talpa media for about gbp 22 million.
you understand why there are often discussions on that issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by nothing?
lord hall insisted that the bbc1 show -- featuring paloma faith and boy george in juriu -- be achieved " in a bbc-specific manner. "
he added that he wants the corporation " to find gold egg hole in his own ography " next time when he launches a entertainment show.
however, he refused to ban the future future taking taking new seasons in the voice or spending money on licenses on other entertainment facilities.

today, king salman said the binladin group should not have left the arm of the butcral when the bloodshed was not in operation.
an arab version of the decree, published by the saudi press agency, said the binladin group bears partly blame for the collapse.
the news agency's english service did not not present the detail, but said company leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
earlier this week, salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the maccrcral in court court the great mosque, where hundreds of thousands of muslims came before hajj pelgrigrige later this month.
the binladin group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the maccral and group representatives could not be contacted for statements.
the royal decree blamed the group for failing to use up-to-date safety safety measures and did not coordinate its work with weather authorities.
dozens of cranes round the great mosque ca mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the binladin group.
for several decades, the binladin family has had a close relationship with saudi's royal family family has been conducting major construction projects.
qqaeda qaeda leader, osama bin laden, was a " reneged, " disinherited by the family in the 1990s.
the collapse occurred in strong wind and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, journey at least once in the lives of every physically pressed muslim.
authorities say 158 people remain in hospital.
the authorities have decided that relatives of deceased victims to receive one million saudi village (gbp 17000) and the same amount to pay to those with permanent injuries.
other injured will receive half of that amount.
advantages, disadvantages of credit conversion into swiss francs
two offers of conversion have already appeared on the banking market into credit credit ei in swiss francs, with the main advantages being excluding currency risk and lowering rates.
disadvantages can come in a few years' time, when variable interest can lead to an increase in rates.
the transylvania bank has just completed the process of credit conversion into francs granted by volksbank, and the post announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
according to cumulative data by analysts from the finzoom financial portal, the post offer three years of fixed interest at lei of 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
on the other hand, the transylvania bank's offer to conversion was accepted by 83% of customers with credit in francs because due to two successive cuts: the balance has been reduced to the value of risk and administration paid by the customer, then an additional 22.5% reduction in the lei was applied.
both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, from how they they equivalent monthly in lei before conversion.
thus, the transylvania bank reduces the rate by 42.5%, and bankpost, by 33 per cent in the first three years and, theoretically by 18% in the coming years.
benefits
the main advantage of co-any in credit lei in chf is that foreign currency risk is eliminated, with the consumer protected by future franc increases, and reimbursement of credit will be made in the currency where he receives his salary.
another major advantage of both offers for conversion is that no reassessment property property not being made, additional guarantees are no being required and another proof of income.
in practical terms, no new financial and legal financial and legal analysis of credit, nor will there there be additional costs as in the case of refinancing.
both banks also offer a reduction at the monthly rate, from much customers paid before conversion sion equivalent equivalent to lei.
risks
the problem is that the first years rate is made up more of interest, and the customer repaying very little mainly.
the offer of very low interest interest bills over the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
however, it is not known how this interest will evolve after three years.
the margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25 per cent, so in total, and cost reduction is lower.
a possible risk to all credits in the variable interest lei is for the robor index to increase significantly in the coming years (more than the libor - chf) index.
for example robor at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 he reached 6% in 2009, to more than 15% and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
in addition, it may also defend other costs, mentioned in its initial offer.
time is decisions on the interest rate on the us federal reserve
the world is watching its eyes at a meeting scheduled in two days' time wednesday and thursday, when the us federal reserve will make a crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time about a decade later.
in a reuters poll with the participation of 80 economists, just over half who last week thought the decision would be taken, i now believe the situation would remain some time and that interest rates would be retained within the current 0-0.25%.
this is an historic event because seven years have passed since the federal reserve brought the rates to zero.
for the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a process of normalising interest rates, " said angel ubide, chief analyst at the peterson institute for international economics.
the us economy has evolved relatively well, with recovery by bringing triltrillion into balance sheet and generating low low inflation inflation.
however, the federal reserve must not ignore the global situation less roz.
it has warned the markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
the decision will be announced on tuesday, 20: 00 the tec.
stars who lost their charming

player luke shaw of manchester united stands on bmonths because of double fracks.
luke shaw suffered a double fracture on his leg in manchester united match in the champions league ended with a defeat over psv eindhoven.
after the event that brought ears tears to the player's eyes and which will keep bara for at least six months, louis van gaal remains optimistic shaw will will be able to play this season again.
the injury came following an reckless intervention by héctor moreno in the 15th minute after shaw, 20, broke attthe psv defence.
he received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
van gaal said, " he has double fracture on his leg and is in hospital. "
it will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps the day tomorrow then it will be operated in manchester.
it is appalling - a boy who came to manchester united when he had 18-old, has difficulties, then plays fantastic and now this is happening.
in the west was put a mask of oxyen.
the complaint.
i am not a doctor, but at the double rest fracency is six months and and will not play in the group phase.
i hope that it can play this season season again.
it seems that moreno has had luck and has escaped the red card and conceconcession a coup of punishment.
refereferee nicola rizzoli has not punished mexican mexican.
van gaal suggested that italian official was wrong wrong.
you can judge alone when i say that it is fault and red card.
it was a very ugly intervention with two legs.
a message on shaw's twitter account:' thank you all for your messages, i do not have words to express how weakened i feel, i start the road to recovery, i will come back stronger'.

our players never seek to accidby an adversary.

adam lyth clearly ried england omission, but is still still high
the victory against pakistan in the united arab emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing england's team for the tournament, i do not consider a repeat of 3-0 defeat in test matches.
i would not eliminate a victory in travel either.
alastair cook's team may have less experience than three years ago, but it has good spplayers in the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked 2012 events but will take a positive attitude to youth.
moteen evolevolving as thorner and adil rashid, even though he unknown at the test level, is an option for the attack.
similar topics: adam lyth left england team for test matches and was replaced by alex hales
obviously, as his main coach of yorkshire, i find it difficult to look at the decision not to select adam lyth on the team.
he played the seven test matches against two good strikers under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are on tried after results.
there have been no questions about joe root, for example, until announcements have been made because - and i said this earlier - the players are their own selection.
no fifty years and can lyth would have extended his run, but his destiny is in its hands.
i hope that if he makes more run for yorkshire it will have other opportunities.
the main coach of the england team, trevor bayliss, praised his attitude even when his performance was not match his capacity, and it does not surprise me; above all, he is a team man.
it is hard to answer the question as long long a batsman is noted in test matches.
lyth had seven run -- like sam robson before him -- while nick compton had nine.
only compton has had luck at home and in travel.
the only dissatisfaction you can have was that england preferred jonathan trott on the caribbean tour - when lyth was in the utmost form - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
on the team comes alex hales, a batsman i co-chair very well.
he is a cricket player who has " " x factor " and i noted earlier in yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a pitch trent bridge.
it should be be given the same opportunity as those before it, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the uae team.
the idea was launched that moteen opening up to beating alongside cook, which would lead extra spinner while preserving four quicks, and i have nothing against it.
i do not see why a throw could not hit there and this clumsy player has already shown that nais nabeing ve.
moteen een did not bring success to his district, worcshire re but but was no 3 for them, so the difference is not big.
my old team colleague, justin langer, played his first 38 test matches 38 that the first drop before entering the open in 2001.
it ouped three centuries immediately and did not look behind.
zafar ansari comes to the team on back-up spinner and, although i had limited contact with him, he kidnstruck me that being a very impressive young man.
people could judge the early age -- with an average of 31 to the beating and 35 on the ball -- and might think it is a bridges, but there is no lot of thorny and the selection opted for youth.
it will learn a lot from this tournament.
england has also made some changes to the coaches team.
the appointment of mahela jayawardene, sri lanka's batsman, as test matches consultant could be a master coup.
it is one of the best players and it will bring a great deal of experience, given that it has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
paul collingwood comes for white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and ruthless ambition.
i have always thought he was born to get involved in the international cricket, whether a player or coach, and like mahela, has a intition.
sometimes, new voices in the west, even if they send messages that were sent even before, can bring fresh air to the team.
colly durham's mate, ben stokes rest for the one-day matches, root received a similar break against australia, and i have no problem with that.
although not all agree, coaches and selection are not making the programme.
and you must bear note, players' jobs depend on the results they achieve.
such decisions are never made easily.
brebrexit camp could win if economy remains in acaltmie by 2017
every day it passes, the strategy for renegotiate david cameron in order to keep britain into the eu goes increasingly into into the mess, even without the election of geniant jeremy " yes or not? " corbyn to lead the labour party tuc brings serious criticism of europe on tuesday.
foreigners also have charers such as corbyn and nigel farages.
a european diplomat explained the last days that - sinmerged in crises similar to that in the eu - not all being caused internally - some member states are fuelled with britain's agenda of concessions and changes to the treaties, which the majority do not want.
in brighton, at the annual meeting, the tuc decided that they do not want so either if they erode social protection.
we could even call it dave and george's' selfi' agenda.
the prime minister and chancellor are attending bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, make a picture before a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and says they have won allies for reform.
it is just about me.
my european friend, who wants great britain a perspective outward under the roof of the eu -- " not leave us alone with france, " berlin says -- suggests that more ministers and narrow officials from certain capitals have reached where point they do not care whether they remain or leave.
angela merkel, german german chancellor highly cautious, is an ally, but has been at the helm for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation clks, as happened with thatcher (11), mitter( 14) and kohl (16), who stood too much.
in 2017, french president françois hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
his power is also in decline.
poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, spain left-wing spain.
it is hard to believe that they will help the english who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent scotland from emerging of britain - something that they do not want either because majority have similar separatist tendencies.
thus, some ministers could even plan to make remarks that do not help in snsnp style in the 2017 referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the brexit process, my amsuggests.
" renegotiation has been fixed " and " britain has achieved nothing value from the renegotiation. "
europeans know on their skin how acdefending fleet street can be and how sceptical the oligarchic press barons are who who concern the eu with scepticism, because they did not participate the 1975 referendum inspired by tony benn n who ratified our 1973 entry into report 2: 1.
perhaps i remember vaguof boris johnson, the euro opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was brussels's resent ent.
ed miliband knew his enemies.
they have included the mixture of unpaybags, foreigners who telephone fraud and pseudo non-domme holding most of the important newspapers.
in fact, tony blair see him about the same, but he realised that when you are closed in a cubox alongside a nernerous gorila, you have to give his bananas to distract his attention from thinking of eat at lunch and tea.
in fact, miliband was more milder than blair in opposition to cameron cameron idea idea of referendum, as blair made a concession on the principle to the abandoned eu constitution buried by french and dutch voters in 2005, who gave him an exit card.
the media did not forgive him for that either.
but jeremy corbyn, who has reached my friendship by back at westminster on monday - i told him not to consumconsume his time again me me - seems to be in danger to adopting from the ou the murdoch strategy for boycotting nekinnock of the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
it may last, but it must develop a coherent strategy for co-operation with the media, not with me, but certainly with andrew marr whose position at the bbc left a vacation sunday.
corbyn's official position towards europe is what i would llently call development.
he says he would like to stay in a reformed eu.
most of those who disagree with conservative' anglicism " could agree to that.
that said hilary " a benn, but not a bennite " benn on radio and tv this week, when his researcher struggled not to recognise that corbyn's appointment john mcdonnell as shadow shadow minister " on financial issues was a bad idea.
he reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought tv to be unfair to labour colleagues without going too far and without losing his post in the cabinet.
hilary's fight has been more attractive.
but the fight to remain " in any situation " - benn's expression -- does not correspond to what mcdonnell said, nor with what jc told colleagues and lawmakers at a private meeting monday night.
regardless of the image that corbyn wants to convey - remember, he has also made me sensitive - the discipline of messages remains important in the television era and, in particular in the varieties of social networks, a paranoia and treason bed.
it is right not to give cameron a' yes' ticket in europe, allowing him to good support labour support in the referendum campaign, as mcdonnell said.
simon jenkins certainly believes that.
however, basic sopstry mcdonnell and corbyin with regard to eu membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a hesitant discussion among left-wing dissidents why the nardatism of small differences is a central dogma.
as with sostry on nato - tom watson is adamant that the jc will not campaign for abandon - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
why should waste paris or berlin of political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to britain when everything could be pointless?
the us is already quite disappointed about the weak english military performance in iraq, libya and syria, even with a conservative government that is cutting costs, as was reminded of the launch the british influence security forum on monday.
specialists criticise england's public health department decision on electronic cigarettes
according to researchers, the claims by a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with links in the tobacco industry.
specialists from the british medical journal's british medical journal (bmj) joined the lancet in criticising evidence used by the england department public health department (communications) in his report on electronic cigarettes.
the upgrade published the " reference " report last month described it as a " complex analysis of evidence. "
however, several researchers have questioned the the robustof data and have pointing finfinger at links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
an article published last month in the lancet medical magazine attacked the' extraordinarily fragile basis' on which he founded the main conclusion.
two other researchers writing in the bmj questioned claims and base them " on solid soil or moving sand. "
martin mckee, a european public health professor at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, and simon capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at liverpool university, said, " a fundamental principle of public health is policies must be based based on proof effectiveness. "
they said they expect claims of are tions that " current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking' are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
in reality, only one meeting attended by 12 people led to the drafting of a model for analysing decision-making analysis with multiple criteria (mcda) that synsummarises their views on the negative effects associated with various products containing nicotina; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research work.
mckee and capewell, said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called euroswiss health, whose executive director was said would have have received funding from british american tobacco to conduct an independent study.
it also validated the accreditation of bat in public health in a report on sustainability, he said.
they added that one of 12 participants in the meeting said funding from a producer of electronic cigarettes, but not funding there are reports reports have have received from the cigarette and manufacturing company, philip morris international.
no arguments have been provided on the basis of which members of the ship were selected, but these include several " frbpan " known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even say industry's funding in the work.
other attending the meeting are not known for expertise in tobacco control.
the head of the tobacco control section in the selection also attended the meeting.
the research work drafted by the group " convincingly muswashes " the fact that " solid evidence of " evidence of the detrimental effect that most products has according to the criteria, " mckee and capewell said.
however, the report report, none of these links are mentioned in the report.
mckee and capewell said claims the warnings that " so far, there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers " are premature.
professor kevin fenton, director of the department of health from literature, says he has responded in the past to claims in bmj.
he said, " electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking "
one in two people who smoke all life life lose their lives because to this vice.
all evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic health cigarettes is comparatively minor minor, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
the renewal has a clear duty to inform the public about information arising and those that do not come out of evidence, particularly given the high degree of public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
annually, around 80,000 people lose their lives due to smoking-related disease, and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking reach gbp 2 billion.
clearly expressing the current evidence - namely that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risk, they present only a frfraction of the detrimental effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national debt.

violinist david grimal: during bach bach era there were no world tourntours.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people working, artists and not commercial representatives.
french violinist david grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a list but also as an initiator of a less ordinary project project, downentitled' strange strange', as he even says, les dissonsonances an an orchestra of international soloists and talented musicians, who interprea symphony reperreperto, and that makes it a little.
les dissonances was at this year escu enescu festival with two performances: a performance on sunday, in which solist was david grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one monday, when violonist xavier phillips was first, works composed composed by enescu nelipsite.
both performances, held on the athens scene, showed the public another kind of interpret classical music.
les dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at the time, the only classic musical whole in which there is no conductor.
the conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
it is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either in order become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - i speak about instrumentolers, not by composers.
they are trained as' specialised workers'.
they themselves have the impression that they need a conductor.
on the other side of the scene, for the public, all the musical complaint focuses on the conductor.
and so business, the music industry, is making marketing.
therefore, we are talking about music.
so, if we look at this world, we have qualified workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and a public who cannot listen, but they must look, which and is stupid', david grimal believes.
the violinist tells that the change in the way music music came followed the " musical deception " in his solist career.
i was like a high-level athlete that was supposed to the same exercise throughout the world with different orchestorchestras, to earn a lot of money and bring money to the music industry.
10 years ago, when we was around 30 years, i found this very depressing, because we no longer found human creativity and fraternity in this system.
so we have not found no sense in continuing along this path.
that is how i decided to create les dissonances.
this was in 2004, and at the time no one did so without a conductor:' the music, extremely conservative world world did not want such projects'.
" how do i imagine making marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no longer ego? " the artist asks.
david grimal acknowledges les dissonaces is " a luxury, " adding that none of the musicians part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
in 10 years of existence of the ensle, the lack of a conductor did not proved to be a hindrance in the music act: " curiious, the more we we weigh up a more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in work and not just in a role, " grimal, adding that sunday sunday's we were 74 conductors. "
in grimal's opinion, the enăescu festival is a' very courageous' one, precisely because it also invited les dissonances:' an extraordinary festival, where the biggest orchestras in the world who sing and 3 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras also invited this strange group'.
in a temple of orchestorchestal tradition, such as the enăănescu festival, there is the place and interest in something different, breaks breaks barriers.
speaking about enescu's work, the violonist acknowledges he he feeling romanian music of the famous romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when introducing enenescu works on his repertoire.
grimal notes that enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is when we talk about george enescu and romanian music, " because there is also a george enescu who did french music. "
grimal advocates changing the change how classical musical education is done, believing that the' musician profession, as organised today, has a death flk' and that' the future of music is music itself'.
we do not need to tour the world 5 round 5 times a year if it serves nothing.
during the era of bach, there were no world tours.
beethoven, brahms, bartok, enescu were people working, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
for me, organising concerts, festivals, tournaments, the launch of albu, all are all formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they serve serve music.
if not, we are in a system in which creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
to illustrate this phenomenon, david grimal set an example to romanian products before and post as accession of the european union:' in romania, before entering the eu, had good vegetables and meat'.
to enter the eu, you have had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
production and agriculture reach the service supermarket service, as is the case in france.
the same happens with music, it is the same logic.
les dissonances makes tomatoes may not too beautiful, but when we cut them are tomatoes.
in an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
" if we considered -- as the koreans, chinese chinese, japanese do -- that western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce his school learning, we would reintroduce concerts on television and this education there we would no need to sell musical subproducts, " grimal believes.
there are certainly things in classical musical education that remain very communist, which is everywhere, is something very militarised.
it is up to this discipline whether we compare a musician with a soldier or whether we form a musician who will perform at an instrument and being, above all, the musician.
we are talking about a completely different education if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) we need to be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it is something else.
after your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician? " asks the french artist smilsmiling.
grimal shows that, for artists, the reward for another kind of doing music comes precisely from overcoming this' soldier soldier' status, overcoming what " they think they are their limits':' musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and therefore therefore go after the concert'.
david grimal spoke about his music project and his vision of music and the artist at " festival of ideas, " a discussion with the public held at the george enescu international festival by the aspen romania institute.

fedex gains mixed, lower fiscal forecasts for 2016
fedex said disappointing results for the last quarter, with the supply giant reducing profit estimates for all year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
the company also said it plans to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
during the same period last year, fedex announced that it would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
the company's shares dropped by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of wednesday's opening bell.
fedex corp. said he expects to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year next may with 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimates.
analysts expected $10.84, according to a poll by tset poll.
falling falling estimates despite despite rising prices by 4.9% on average, with an entry into force on 4 january and the higher land transport overps of large or heavy weight packages, which will apply since november.
the company said it still expects increased gains from the previous year as a result of cost costs, higher incomes and the development of online trade.
president and general director fred smith said " the firm faces a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, particularly as regards global production and trade. "
employment plans during the holiday period announced a day after ups contesttor said it plans to employ 90,000-95,000 additional workers, the same number of employment it made last year.
in the quarter ending on august 31st, fedex won $692m, 6% more than the previous year.
earnings per action were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per action by 12 analysts who responded to the zacks investment research poll.
profit increased by $5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
six analysts who participated in zacks estimau worth $12.23 billion.
fedex has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading led stagnation in revenues from its unit express.
but the explosion in online shopping drew the results of the fedex ground division.
in the last quarter, revenues from the ground division increased by 29%, but operational revenues practically stalled due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
the express express registered an increase in revenues due to higher basic tariffs, while freight division revenues fell due to rising costs.
at pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, fedex shares dropped $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
on tuesday at closure closure dropped 11 per cent year-on-year and 17 per cent compared to the record record on june 11th.
at the most awaited meeting in recent years, policypolicy making makers within the federal reserve will spend two days this week around a table of mahon honduras an 27 27 to decide whether the time has come to increase key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
above them, at a central bank meeting hall, a diral picture of the united states will be measured.
the map is intended to recall that janet l. yellen, chairman of edf, and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all.
the central bank has received a dual task from congress: to maximise the employment rate in the us and maintain price stability.
but since the great economic crisis, edf leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
and this third task could be the x factor in a decision too difficult to predict, which will be announced on tuesday, and which will determine whether the us economy is ready to be disated by the unprecedented stimulus offered by the almost zero-term interest rate in force since the end of 2008.
even though most data indicate a strong growing economy, the recent stiitation on the global financial markets could frighten edf officials already wary of adding volatility by increasing the benchmark to federal funds - even only a quarter of a percentage point.
" obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will, " said lindsey m. piegza,, chief economist at brokeraj stifel nicolaus & co.
" but, i think that if they sought an excuse not to increase the interest rate, growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait longer, " she said.
there is no consensus on the decision that the edf will take, and in itself itself causing instability in the financial market.
about half of economists recently questioned by bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
but the financial markets expect the edf to postpone, with a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30%.
this would indicate a decrease on stock exchange if the edf increases its interest rate, unless those drafting policies cualleviate the blow by pledging for a long time to the next growth.
on tuesday, the industrial average dow jones moved up 228.89 points, or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
the momentum was triggered by expectations that edf makers will maintain the stable interest rate this week, john lonski, chief economist at moody's capital markets research group.
" it would be surprising for the edf to increase the interest rate at the moment, " lonski said.
if edf decision makers did so,' should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets'.
other experts have said an increase in interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the edf acted.
just a month ago, the edf seemed to be about to increase rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the force of us recovery.
yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expects an interest rate increase this year despite objections raised by the liberals that more economic progress were needed.
although job creation slowed down in august, labour market market growth was solid this year.
unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the edf as full employment.
wage gains have shown signs of growth.
and although inflation has continued not to achieve the central bank's annual goal, edf decision said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply windfalling oil prices.
the economy " can cope with higher rates and needs them, given tension in the labour market, " said ian ian shepherdson, chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics.
however, the global financial markets began entering fibrilations at the end of this month after china devalued its currency.
the industrial average dow jones dropped by 16% below the record maximum reached in may, as investors feared that the slowing in the chinese economy would shrdown world growth.
the market minute ed somewhat this month, with the dow index now about 10% below the maximum in may.
for edf decision makers, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of a of interest rate is rising.
" without what has happened in the financial markets and news about the weakening of the chinese economy in recent weeks, would be stronger at the sitting, " said stephen d. oliner, an experienced researcher at the ucla in the ziman centre for real estate and former officially the edf.
now he expects to wait for at least month to better manage the effects better.
" there is a great deal of uncertainty about which the impact will be on the us economy and almost have no data on which it will based on events in china, " oliner said.
the well-being of the global economy is not one of the edf's major interests, so should should not be taken into account in decision making.
in reality, however, the edf has become the monetary authority worldwide.
in recent years, the central bank's influence has been huge.
simply alluding by then president ben s. bernanke ke in 2013 as the edf could' narrow narrow' monetary expansion has triggered earthquake in global markets.
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly emanated, edf officials are expected not only to monitor the progress made in other areas, but also to consult other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
his decision-making process is " more art than science science, " said zachary karabell head of the global strategy department in the welfare management firm envestnet inc.
jeffrey lacker, federal federal reserve bank in richmond, will., said this month that " the edf has an oversized reaction record to changes in the financial market that appear not be related to economic bases. "
lacker, a voting member of the federal commission on the open market, a decision-making body, which supported the interest rate increase, offered the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
a financial crisis that has affected asia has led the edf to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, " despite limited limited identification for us development, " lacker said.
a year later, edf officials returned to those drops.
the edf should put the issue of financial stability first in the event of a major crisis, such as the the 2008 market earthquake, said adam s. posen, former member of of interest interest setting commission in the bank of england.
the last turbulent period does far far up to that level, he said.
" we certainly don't want to end up in a situation to fear of an increase in interest rate because the markets have angaired, " said posen, president president peterson institute for international economics.
the federal reserve act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, i do not believe that it should take premature action.

according to bishnu prasad dhakal, head of the district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station, and some whom threw stones and molotov cocktails.
mr. dhakal said police forces used tear gas after shooting fired gunair before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.

weight-reduction surgery could be useful in the case of light esity diabetiations
the benefits of ea2 surreduction ation for light obesity people, type type 2 diabet et could remain for at least five years, according to a new study.
it is still premature to say whether easy obesity diabetiethics live more after loss surging loss intervention than those following nechirurgical treatments.
" there is long has long to centralise alise mortality, " said dr robin blackstone, a specialist on obesity surgery, she wrote an article on the new study in jama surgery.
operations for loss of weight, referred and baribarrier surgery, use various methods to reduce dental.
they reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the capacity of the body to absorb food.
over the years, surgery on baribarrier has proved efficiency in the treatment of type 2 sugar ababet, but most studies have taken place on people with morbiobesity with a corporate mass index (imc) 35 or higher.
the imc, a unit of measure of weight to equal,, is considered normal during 18.5-24.9.
the imc value of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and imc people more than 30 are considered obese.
you can calculate your imc accessing: 1.usa.gov / 1d0zqdv.
for the new study, researchers at the general min-sheng hospital in taiwan used data collected after 2007 in a trial in which comparcompare two types of surgery of baririca - bypass gastric and gastrectomie in manson - in medical treatment of type 2 diabet to light obesity.
the imc mediu to surseeking surgery dropped from 31 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year as part of the study.
meanwhile, the imc to people receiving nechirurgical treatments against sugar sugar sugar et remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
of those who suffered surgery intervention, zaharat diabetet sold ed to 36% and in part to 28%.
in the group treated through medical methods, by comparison, the sugar diabetet completely healed to only 1% and partly to only 2% of the subjects.
in addition, control of terrial tension, gliceridele and lmr colesterol cholester' were generally better in the surgeical group', the authors concluded.
researchers also monitored the sanguin level of hemogloba1c, which reflects the level of gschool level over time.
researchers write that the optimal level of hemogloba1c is less than 7%.
after surgeintervention, the average level of hemogloba1c has dropped from about 9% to about 6 per cent.
but in the group treated through medical methods, it was maintained at around 8%.
but this improved " glicemcontrol " -- reflected in haemogloba1c's improved levels -- have not reduced the mortality rate to five years, according to chief researcher dr chih-cheng hsu and their colleagues.
the research team also compared average results associated with the two types of sursurical intervention.
in the fifth year, compared to the gastrectomie group in manson), 7 bypass surgeation group lost more weiweight (18.7 compared to 14.2 kg), it registered considerable falls in the imc value (7.4 compared to 5.1) and hemogloba1c (3.1 to 2.1%) and presented higher reability.
although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery five years later, there is evidence from a study by high-weight people in sweden that surgeical intervention life, says blackstone, of arizona university, the faculty of medicine - phoenix.
in the swedish study, obese people who have suffered barrier barrier surgery showed about 29% lower of die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients who suffered surgeical intervention, blackstone said it is optimistic optimistic for people with imc under 35 interested in the procedure.
" this is the point where this work is critical, because it says this surgeical intervention is safe in the lower imc group, " without increasing the risk of death or renal disease, she says.
blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start - taking weight seriously then the patient's imc reaches 27-30.
" i think we wait too long until we urge the people to take this seriously, " she said.
i believe that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have shorcircuthem their bodies pre disposing them to obesity and diabet, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
" it is impossible for everyone to come europe europe " -- dalai lama -- rt news.
europe could not all refugees, the dalai lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the middle east.
the tibetan buddhist leader has called an appeal to end the violence in mother countries of refugees.
the dalai lama spoke about the problem of the current refugee crisis in his speech at opening opening the dalai lama centre for compassion in oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the start of his 10-day visit to britain.
he said that in the current situation, humanity's interests should prevail over the interests of each nation and even every continent.
he also stressed that while admiadmirable, the response of western european countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
" it is impossible for everyone come to europe, " he said in his speech.
although the dalai lama praised germany and austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
" it is the wonderful care for several thousand refugees, but at the same time have to think about long-term solutions bring bring sincere peace and development, especially through education, to muslim countries, " he stressed.
essentially, we need to think about ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
we need to reduce the use of force.
force has never solved these problems, " he added.
on the issue of violence, the dalai lama also commented on george bush's actions after the 11 september terrorist attacks, saying that the violent response from the us led to an uncontrollable chain of events.
after the events of 11 september, i expressed my condolences in a letter to president bush and told him to resolve this problem without turning to violence.
i know his reasons were strong, but he used force and generated unexpected consequences, " the dalai lama said.
four-fold increase in children number children children crued detergent hands over the past 4 years.
according to georgia's anti-poisoning centre, the us anti-poisoning centres have reported an increase of around 400% since 2010 in terms of number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed detergent hands with high alcohol content.
according to dr gaylord lopez, director of georgia's anti-otrare centre, cases of inggation of detergant of hands to children under 12-of children reported at anti-otravicentres moved from 3,266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
" children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the chamber of emergency, " lopez told cnn.
lopez said some children intentiondeliberately deterdetergent and others do doing so to impress their friends to respond to challenges on social networks.
films can be watched on youtube showing teenagers such bdrink detergent gent to create cheap drinages.
teenagers are said to have mixed alcohol-mouth water detergant in order to obtain stronger drink.
smaller children can be drawn to the attractive smell of detergents.
" a child does not think that he is hurt them, " lopez says.
many of the most attractive types (of detergent hands) are par@-@ smoking ated.
detergents of goberur arms, strugure, portocals are the most attractive to children.
hands detergant contains about 45-95 per cent alcohol.
especially at small children, only a few freeisers can cause alcohol poisoning.
" it is very focused alcohol, " dr stephen thornton, medical medical director of the anti-oning centre at the kansas university hospital, told fox 4 channel in kansas city.

why i witness execution in oklahoma
later today, except tarlate legal intervention, i will look how a man is sentenced to death.
if it happens, and i hope it does not happen, i will stand in a room for observers in the execution chamber the state prison ary oklahoma and see richard glossip is executed by managing lethal injection.
he asked me to be one of four officials witnesses his death.
the invitation first came in january through its best friend, and, although i was shocked, i accepted.
as the day he is approaches, i am appalled the idea.
so why do so?
i agreed because i thought this was a good way to tell all whole story of the capital penalty.
it would offer a single perspective.
it is true, journalists can witness executions in america and, because applications usually exceed the number of seats available, a macabra lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
oklahoma has reduced the number of places reserved aside for media representatives from 12 to five.
those elected will look at impartiality execution.
i cannot do that.
i would stand next to richard glossip's closest friends, in addition i have developed my own connection with him over months of telephone conversations and a visit that that lasted two-half hours.
i like the kind.
we often laua great deal when we speak.
prison authorities say i cannot be a witness journalist journalist, so i will not allowed to have a net and a pix to me to note what i see.
i will have to try to remember all the details.
a journalist from oklahoma accused twitter of compromising my impartiality.
that is the lesson.
it tells the story of the holder as he wants, gains access.
i complained about it.
he acknowledged that " he could have formulated better, " but he says i am wrong.
richard glossip did agreed with some of the things i said and wrote.
it does not tell me what to write, and i would not do so even if they asked me.
i told him he could eliminate me from from the witness list witnesses any time.
but it wants an international report writing on the subject to be present.
it believes that, if it dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
kim bellware, reporter for huffington post, will be with me.
if you want to find out more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that we have done.
i will not come back here to all details here.
i cannot say with certainty that richard glossip is innocent.
his actions after barry van treese's murder are guilty of complicity.
but i think he is probably not to be guilty of murder.
i certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
i think his execution is wrong.
and i will look at it dirdying from this perspective.
i cannot claim to be totally objective.
for this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
from me, you will find out how is to regard a man he like by dying unnecessarily.
peter moody claims steps try to spy him, threatens to withdraw from races
peter moody said stesteracing victory tried to infiltrate a spy to his wheat last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from races.
it launched an attack against stewards and the integrity department of racing victoria, saying they are conducting a personal campaign against him, a drop that filled the glass being removal of lady tatai from the race due to treatment administered on race day.
moody told fair media fax that it has always tried to do the best for flights and that it is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive outcome to leaders' cobaltest, for which he has no explanation.
for 18 months he has swallowed his words on statements on spies and did not want to sole the' vulpea that does not reach grapes'.
" i was not going to say anything about that and i was silent for a long time, but sometimes you reach such a high level of frustration that everything is burburst suddenly, " moody said.
it is a fact that it has continued.
sometimes reactionreact and have to suffer the consequences, and i will have to live with what i have said.
i night i will go home and i slesleetpeacefully.
i want to go my head high high and i want the owners i am working to see that i endeavour to give them the best.
since they start to believe that this is not case, i have to give up the traling profession.
at that time, i will have to think what i will do with my certification.
earlier, moody threw the bomb in an interview with racing.com in saying the integrity department tried to spspy on the records.
" eighteen months ago, terry bailey, dayle brown and dr brian stewart were sitting in a room with a man -- whose name i will say if i am asked -- and offered to him to my cards to provide information about the work there, " moody told racing.com.
i obviously considers me a trisor.
if that is the case, then they should resign because they were incompetent in an attempt to catch me.
robert roulston, former president of rvl, david moodie, current president of rvl and bernard saundry, current executive executive ceo of rvl, knew at the time and and also know today.
should i think this is something personal?
is it necessary for the rl to start having the backbone and can hold people out outside living accountable for what is happening in industry?
do i have a bad influence on industry?
is so bad is my influence on industry?
perhaps that is how i see others.
perhaps i have to take my license and give me aside, and i have no doubt that the statements i are making now could lead them to think about this option.
however, i have come to the point where i do longer care and that is what saddens me.
it sadme very greatly.
i will put pressure and lead them to make a decision.
my family supports me and i can leave.
the frustration of the living grew increased with the long investigation into cobalt testing in which leaders leaders were involved and the removal led him to say he could " put his license on the table. "
moody, whose name is most often associated with training of the undefeated champion black caviar, labelled the rule of race-day day as " ridiculous " after applying on the foot of a cataplma ma namol or or silver, violating the rules.
it violates racflights' rules.
i have to take full responsibility for this, " he says.
one of my employees mistakentally put namol on the foot.
it could have happened last night.
it could have happened yesterday, which has happened.
it happened on the race day.
moody could be qualified for three months for the day-day treatment consisting of catcuisdes, for which the steps opened an investigation.
it is a joke.
the people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
" we all understand that rules needed needed but it went too far, " moody said.

coach melbourne storm craig bellamy responds to opponents in the wrestling charges.
coach melbourne storm craig bellamy appointed criticism of his team's placence tactics as " distorted topics " brought raised by the two main favourites in nrl.
sydney coach roosters, trent robinson, said the referees allowed players players the storm to " take them in tranta " team team the storm storm nervos in a qualification final late friday in sydney.
brisbane broncos coach wayne bennett made a slight reference to storm after his team's victory in the qualification ququeensland cowboys qualimatch saturday late saturday, when he called the match " demonstration " of the rugby league said the two teams in queensland were not good in wrestling.
bellamy jumped in defending the plates tactics his team team and said the players simply focused on " contact " when they liked.
bellamy says he gained confidence after two key coaches criticised his team, meaning they were concerned that storm would defeat them.
" and things do not stop there -- we did not hear trent robinson to complain about wrestling when beat us 24-2, " bellamy said on wednesday.
i can ensure that we have not changed our defensive systems or techniques or techniques every year, so only as in the last six weeks, we have really emphasised contact in plates, and so we have changed the situation.
trent has been in the post for three years, it obviously has a wonderful team so it is probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
we know how it is always happening at this time of year.
bellamy contradicted bennett's idea of " animanimate football, " recalling bennett's st george ilillawarra dragons won the championship in 2010 playing " " boring " football.
wayne talks about palpitant football.
he argued his opinion comparing play evening saturday with our game late friday and spoke about how pitexciting the game was, " bellamy said.
i remember that in 2010, st george received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team, and wayne said he was not interested in him how black under the angle.
but now it has a team that can play what we would as palpitant football, especially because of quick young midfielders.
this kind of game you want to do it when you have such players.
he brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play -- not any team has two midfielder like anthony milford and ben hunt to that able can play the way.
it gives me more confidence because they say this because they are somewhat concerned about the match with us.
six weeks ago they probably did think of us when they thought of important matches.
bellamy also stressed that the storm match and roosters was a more sharp split over the score compared to the match between broncos and cowboys.
the broncos match was probably a good match, have we not yet seen it how how was the score 16-12?
our match ended 20-18, have there two two attempts in our game, that means palpitant game?
or does pitant mean making breaks and not march?
there are plans for me.
if i talk about us, it means that we one point we could meet them.
storm is free this week because they won the right to play at home either with north queensland cowboys or cronulla sharks in the preliminary preliminary final next saturday in aami park, with tickets for sale starting next morning.

friendsfest: comedy series that taught us us important lessons about male friendship
the absence of similar figures in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men to reaching the top of the last 15 years.
in 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in britain, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
in an attempt to address the problem, the campaign against unfortunate life (campaign against living miserably (calm) designated 2015 as the year of the man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need.
friendship is the heart heart of fighting fight the success of this challenge.
a recent study on more than 2000 high high school students showing symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by sufficiently many friends " with a healthy mood, " his chances for recovery doubles.
similarly, for people who are not pressed, a circle of mental healthy friends halhalve the likelihood of mental disorders emerging.
of course, in order for friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
in this era of the communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes priority before meaningful contact.
our digital lives have doubled the need to create the apparent of a strong, open figure to fun and success, even though in reality it is isolation that dominates.
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call call ininsecist values money,, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic sic values - our inner desire for personal development friendship - which even even deeply affects our mental health.
the billiaire aire inventor of a video game recently explained that the money really does not buy happiness.
the beauty of serious friends was that he turned attention to the idea.
characters were not defined by the workplace but by own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
the mour of joey and chandler's chandler, when they look football football in convenicomfortable seats and the passion of ross for rachel came from the fact that men is known that men can associate themselves with this situation, even though often enjoy from completely explore their feelings.
as a social worker explained to me:'... my role to listening to people with the trend suicide and depressed trend has shown how even the smallest interaction with friends can make a difference' "
often, people appealing to us do not feel able to speak with friends.
his old saying doing alone is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
friends is one of the series that come to mind when trying to provide more mechanisms for psychological adaptation in the long term.
the series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
however much the objective, outside intervention helps, via telephone, people people arrived in times of desperair, long-term support comes from the family and close friends.
thus, if you attend this weekend in the friendeast organised by the central comedy with the full drafting of filplatforms to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to coffee in central perk.
or, even better, if you see someone alone in starbucks, smilile and welcome welcome.
it is never known what difference your friendship could make.
friends broadcast on central comedy from the beginning to the end -- all 236 episodes -- with hook friendsfest.

coming in group a together with real madrid and sahtior donetk, paris needed a strong start against the swedish champions because the french team's objective is not only qualify for optim, but also an improvement in journey to the quarterfinal each of of the last three aments.
but while they took the points, students rent laurent blanc were far from a perfect picture, with zlatan ibrahimovic who wasted the goal opportunity after being replaced by the team in his hometown and the club at which his brilliant career in 1999.

we wanted to win and did so, although i am sorry that we have failed to give one or two goals.
ibrahimovic returned after injury to one of the three changes to the paris team, with a 2-2 reat home by borghex in the 1 league at the weekend, but di maria took over the spotlight in the fourth minute.

but if someone expected the bsp to win victory by mering from fingers, they were disappointed.
malmo, who defeated celtic in play-off to reach this stage and has entered the field with nine holders at national teams, with a five-person defence and two defensive midfielder, was a strong adversary.
but their attack was not impressive, an exception making the appeal of nikola djurdjic who passed through kevin trapp in the 34th minute.
instead, the bsp players have slowed down the pace several times, giving some unnecessary passes and not finish the interventions, even ibrahimovic who missed no fewer than five attempts only in the first half and was then replaced by cavani even after resumption game the game.
ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skilled in supporting her colleagues, with her care being di di maria sent in a sudiverted by wiland over the gate in the 52nd minute.
the second goal was finally scored after an hour broke place in the match, thanks to cavani, uruguayan who scored the season's sixth goal after ibrahimovic passed from the belch of maxwell.
this goal removed the hope from malmo that they will rebalance the score and only a superb by wilstop from a distance for the rejection of david luiz kept the final score before the new ezequiel lavezzi cancelled a goal in extensions.
the team's norwegian coach in malmo, age hareid, later said the bsp was a class class that " the last match we played in the champions league was last december. "
since then, we have only played in sweden swedish league, which is not to the same level.

at the next united house it will be debated.
" i think that in mind this situation will be done relatively quickly, " said senate culture committee president georgica severin.
he added that " it was common sense " for the tvr's leadership would also be present at this meeting, as no representative of the tvr leadership was present at culture committee meeting.
it was common sense to be the tvr leadership present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like this.
the invitation was made to members as last night, with an approximating hour that we did not know new hour, but today after a meeting of the joint offices, personally sent a fax to the tvr leadership by inviting it.
i believe that when you convene, you are a budgetary wage wage, paid from public taxes and are convened to a joint committee meeting even if you do not like you alive.
" because it is your obligation for service, you are in an institution in parliament's subcommittee, " severin said after the joint committee meeting by parliament's culture.

wonders will not be done.
what is important is to take political decisions so that this institution to work.
i am not his man to to you, to tell you that a genius will arise who will stand in the e here and will beat.
i hope that those who decide, parliament's plenary, with their vote will choose very reason the people who will lead the tvr.
there must be people who know what is happening there, have experience and have a great deal of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
i do not know who will be, if you ask me what qualities they must have - i feel in their attitude to employees because it is a maldar of petitions coming from employees, complaints, redundancies.
" when you receive such complaints 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster, " the chairman of the committee of culture of the senate concluded.

he also wants a provision to be issued providing for extending the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become srtv mandmandates for collecting tv tax, by involving anre in regulating this activity.
in its opinion, it is necessary to set a maximum 5% 5% of revenue fees.
stelian tanase is demanding a reduction in the vat rate for activities specific to public television and its contribution to the cnc from 15% to 3%, but also as changes to the 41 / 1994 law, in the possibility of receiving budget allocations / funding to purchase licenses for major cultural and sports -- the world football championship, golden begging, eurovision.
he claims srtv will default in the coming months given that labour law obliges the employer to enforcement of court rulings, even though they are not final and wage rights are high priority over any other obligation.
the tvr administration has constantly made efforts to lower staff spending and tv production.
" this has reduced travel and other cost-generating activities reduced, a number of trade contracts were renegotiated, and in late july, tvr news was closed, " president tvr president's letter said.
young tanhad appreciate that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only through its own efforts.

ponta, charged of uncontrolled libel, irrational claims
hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto harshharshly early wednesday, what romanian prime minister victor ponta said that political decision makers in hungary are " nothing better than those in syria, libya or other countries fleeing refugees. "
" yesterday, victor ponta lost his self-control and, with his irrational claims, offends the entire hungary, " the hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
civilised european politicians do not say such uncontrolled slander.
" his remarks have only one explanation: he fully lost their support in domestic politics in romania, " the head of hungarian diplomacy added, according to mti.
in a post on facebook late tuesday, prime minister victor ponta said he wants to draw attention and sanction the behaviour of senior hungarian government officials, who believe " are a disgrace to the eu culture and values. "
i do not want to respond to the challenges posed by hungarian government representatives.
" these are a disgrace to the culture and values of the european union; and in anti-semitic attitudes, and regarding the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis! " ponta said on facebook.
the romanian prime minister added he is supporter to sensible and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, praising that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
barbed wima, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve solve problem problem they will only show that in hungary, at the heart of europe, political decision makers with nothing better than those in syria, libya or other countries fleeing those refugees!
" i believe in solidarity, in sensible and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of european values -- what we are seeing in recent days in hungary is completely completely contradiction to precisely these objectives and values! " the head of the romanian executive executive stressed.
earlier on tuesday, hungarian foreign minister peter szijjarto called " mere lies " " romanian prime minister victor ponta's remarks on hungary's management of the refugee crisis, praising the claims are inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to mti.
the head of hungarian diplomacy also noted on tuesday that the romanian prime minister's " extremist and misleading remarks " concern the domestic political crisis in romania and made it clear that budapest apologses from the romanian side.
szijjarto referred to a statement by prime minister victor ponta monday.
what i have said, and always say is that i am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are nonsense of environmental ages, and i am totally to this approach.
if we can receive more, we it, the problem is of our logistical capacity to treat those people as people, not as they treatwith our hungarian neighbours, knoking and the seriousness.
" that is i do not agree with, " the head of the romanian executive said at a press conference in targu-jiu.
also on tuesday, peter szijjarto announced that budapest decided to start preparations on the ground for extend to the fence romania border the romania it builbuilding the border border with serbia to deal with any change in the route used by migrants.
later, prime minister victor ponta said hungary's decision to raise a fence at borders solve nothing of the refugee problem and " takes hungary out of europe. "
what link between osama bin laden and the collapse of mecca butaral
saudi authorities have announced that saudi giant binladin group group belonging to osama bin laden's family is " partly responsible " for the collapse of a bloodshed on friday on the great mosque in mecca, a result left 107 people died.
according to an investigative commission, the company has not " comply with the safety rules, " saudi news agency (spa) reported, the bbc reported.
company directors received a ban from leaving the country until the investigation is completed in the case.
the firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
the construction firm is owned by the family of former leader of the al-qaeda terrorist network osama bin laden.
the company was founded by osama bin laden's father 80 years ago and is currently led by the brother of former terrorist leader, bakr.
binladen group has been working working on expanding large mosques for 4 years years to be able to host several pilgrims.
the accident occurred during a storm late friday when a butcher, probably unbalanced by strong wind shelves, collapsed on the eastern part of the roof of the great mosque in mecca.
as a result, 107 people died died and nearly 400 were injured.
how the haghagys closed their challenges
considered by many world's largest football football ler in history, gica hagi was labelled, after his withdrawal from his work, as a weak coach who cannot be able to perform the new post as well.
after unfortunate experiences at the national team, steaua or galatasaray, hagi took over a year ago coaching role in the constant future, which team owner.
a year after fixed after assuming the team, the king demonstrated he was capable of turn a team struggling to save rescue from downgrading to a top one.
thus, a year later, the future recorded recorded, with hagcocoach, 16 victories, 11 misery and 11 defeats.
the balance sheet is one of a top team knobeat on european cups.
things took an even better turn for the future this season, as the team finished second in the 1 league, with 19 points, one less than astra leader giurgiu.
the future also has the best attack in the 1, with 20 goals (equal by astra), more than double than star.
on the other hand, even though he brought several experienced players to the team, hagi i continued the policy of promote young people, and names such as ianis hagi or hodorogea ea emerged in the start team.
the club's policy has made the future a team to pursue for teams abroad, so hagi sold 1.5m euros this summer -- ianis hagi (fiorentina -- 1m euros) and alexandru mitrita (bari -- 500,000 euros).
along with star, the future is the only profitable team in the 1 league, according to trade registry data.
in the refugee crisis, romania has so far played as a small country.
it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
large countries are coming with solutions for all entire eu, says cristian ghinea, a member of the steering college of the romanian european policy centre.
in an interview with ziare.com, cristian ghinea showed that europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and purely police means will not work in this crisis:' perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come from. "
but i are masses that started and we cannot return history.
migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as best as possible and adapt them to us.
in cristian ghinea's view, we are at an extremely emotional time where politicians feel the need to show their muschcles.
once it passes, europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the schengen area must be changed:' schengen is now that an animal created in another age and which was not adapted to the situation now now'.
where are we in the refugee crisis after this jha council which, in fact, solved nothing?
it is clear that ec president agreeing with donald tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
all the notions said that it would have had the necessary votes.
before the treaty of lisbon, the principle of unanimity applies in the jai and any state could block any decision.
that is why things were very little integrated into the area of justice and home affairs.
after lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which it has the initiative, and the council approves it with the vote of 55% of states, namely 16, which accounts for 65% of the eu's population.
the calculations said that the votes existed.
but they did not want to go forward.
as this is a sensitive issue, reactions of rejection emerged emerged in germany itself against chancellor merkel's opening policy and they did not want in many countries to appear as a' eu response sends us migrants back' response.
they have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because obviously this wave is creating a huge problem for schengen governance and we will probably see great changes there in the coming period.
so mandatory quotas have not really been eliminated, but the subject has only been left to stay silent?
yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement frontex in managing external border management, which means a change from the individual responsibility of members who are on the external border of schengen to the responsibility of community agencies.
greece's border with turkey is also germany's border with turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the limits of the old schengen system.
perhaps the dublin principle will be waiup that migrants are the responsibility of the state in which they first the first enter, because it is unsustainable.
if greece capotks, you cannot say forever that it is greece's job.
the problem is common.
precisely because the problem is common, is a resolution possible without a precise, perhaps even binding mechanism mechanism for sharing the reception effort?
no one knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work if they will be reached.
because a problem remains: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to romania or portugal, but in sweden or germany?
i do not believe that european states will be on to take migrants high: you go to country x or in the y y.
some single filtering centres are likely be reached, greece or turkey, where asylum applications to be processed.
work is being done on solutions like this.
but the problem is not a simple resolution.
there are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, are countries without any experience, like romania, where the issue of migrants will increase xenophobic trend.
the fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in turkey, in lebanon, jordan jordan, are in precarious camps and who have only begun to leave for europe.
an estimate says only 10% have gone to leave, winter is hard to last the mediterranean, but we expect an perhaps even larger wave next year.
what are we doing with their people?
my nonsense is that we will get used used to this issue, we will no longer regard it so catastrophic in media terms.
talking by countries with less or greater experience.
does it to you that there is any place where really managed in integrating large groups from an extra-european culture?
i look at magrebians in france, turks in germany, they are also enclaves ented.
i would not go to radical statements.
of course, their integration is more difficult than with other migration waves, but that does not mean that they they do not integrate at all.
it remains an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in france, germany in britain.
but purely police means will not work.
let us create fortress europe is illusory.
it must be overshadowed to integration mechanisms into european societies.
there were some mistakes here.
we need to be more demanding.
let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take the values, no longer remain on an foot in europe and with one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family, including through marriages of convenience.
however, the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
if others have failed in long-term integration does not mean that we must look at them how they is droning in the mediterranean.
perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come from.
and if there is an intervention in syria, which i do not think, does not mean that the country will be restored overnight and take them back.
until solutions arise, we see a fortress sfortress within europe.
borders have been closed, walls are raised, border controls are reintroduced into the schengen area.
is it the european project at risk?
the european project as such not, the schengen area as built, yes.
it was built quite minimal and arranging the rules, so pressure has been too high on countries where they foot put these migrants for the first time.
that is to say, we moving freely around there, but everyone is with his problems.
in the face of such a wave, cannot cannot happen, because some countries are not coping with.
when there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show they are doing something, but in the long term much is not change.
after the attacks in france we we do not have much draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the eu than we had last year.
it is a wave of public emotion that installed in both senses.
and it is so unstable from one week week that you cannot make decisions on the basis of it.
we have a great deal talking talking, many rebellion statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virate.
and then you have the dramatic case of the inececated child turkey and public opinion is moving emotional.
after public public emotion, we will come back to the reasons why we have created this area, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
this is the real single european market.
and i do not believe that europeans will abandon this principle of libertatof movement.
there will be other rules is something else.
schengen is now that an animal created in another age and which was not adapted to the situation now.
romania how has it played in this crisis so far?
as a small country, which believes that if it draws the sogging on the eye and putting its ears, the theme disdisappearing.
in the face of the reality of waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of solution or say that it is not your problem by a small country.
that is what we have done, is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh eu country.
you are not, not play at a large country level.
large countries come up with solutions for the whole of the eu, good or bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
as poland has done.
on the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that romanians' appetite romanians for schengen will fall very greatly.
president iohannis says it is be good that we have not already entered.
so we move moving from disperof entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
there is, of course, a risk whether romania and bulgaria enter schengen that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
this does not mean that it is a reason to entering schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
romania will be part of schengen, and schengen will exist, but transformed into the sense where external external borders become shared responsibility, will be single rules for accepting migrants, single rules of deportation for those-not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
the ukrainian president said that after russia moved its attention to syria to ukraine no one died.
is there a link between the two bias, a game by russia?
russia behaved frustrated power.
she believes that be great power means incurthe americans and europeans.
from this point of view, yes, there is a link.
without the regime's military and financial effort effort, the assad regime would probably long have collapsed.
and it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the islamic state.
any two years have been a fight between the assad regime and moderate secular and muslim militias, supported by gulf and western countries.
then the islamic state was raised and now we no longer know whether we want the assad regime to fall.
russia has been able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
it creates a outbreak of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
but you are only great power only you you have have solutions.
the off-side game is just a strategy to gain time.
unlikely unlikely expects bids to be made, press butons to resolve the situation.
offers do not come because the world is not convinced he can solve one way or another issues issues it also created.
but i do not agree with the theories that say that these people are driven by an invisible hand.
let us not see a little stronger than it is.
what buton will appear soon
millions of facebook users have become used to the " like " button, and now representatives of the social networking are preparing another opposite, " dislike. "
on tuesday, mark zuckerberg, a co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on his account that this buton will be available soon, new york times reported on blog.
zuckerberg made it clear that the " dislike " button would show a nuance of what a user feels rather than just an option.
however, his announcement raised the issue that facebook could become a less friendly place.
zuckerberg noted that he wants to avoid times when someone posts on his account an important event in life and someone else will give " dislike. "
network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active active accounts, have long called to have the opportunity to express express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
mark zuckerberg also said it is not very comfortable for people to give' like' to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of an death of a family member.
" you may may not feel comfortable to give like that post, " the facebook representative noted.
the version of a new facebook button has not been well received by everyone.
" there is already enough hatred on facebook and social alisation networks, " atiq haneef commented afghanistan afghanistan on on the new york times facebook page, where the article on this topic was posted.
" i will give' dislike' the' dislike' button, " he said.
roger anderson, a microbioist in atlanta, claimed there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on facebook.
debra aho williamson, social media analyst at emarketer, noted it is hard to imagine that only single button can send a complex range of negative emotions.
furthermore, she says, the election campaign in america is approaching, and the " dislike " button would create a total disaster.
only 70 refugees entered hungary within 24 hours
hungary accepted only 70 migrants on tuesday, a hand of thousands of mass comers at its border with serbia on tuesday, government adviser gyorgy bakondi announced.
hungary declared a state of emergency later the day in two counties along the border with serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing and announcing that it would build a fence on its border with romania, the dpa recalls.
the move drew a sharp reaction from serbia.
just yesterday they said they would would border logo for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
" as you see, this is totally different, " serbian minister for refugees aleksandar vulin said.
before imposing new immigration legislation, a record 5,8809 migrants entered hungary on sunday, police announced on monday.
more than 170,000 immigrants from the middle east and africa entered hungary from serbia in 2015.
many avoid being registered and are trying to reach the west, especially in germany.

two builders in insolvency
the massive investments made here in recent years to move the institution is be down because they have been stopped several times.
two important builders who worked here entered insolvency during the work.
the headquarters of the county council headquarters vasile alecsandri will end up coming alone.
a year and a half after work on strengthening and re functionalisation of the building should have been completed, work has reached a half.
one last stage in the era of the building was consumed recently, when the national council for dispute challenges (cnsc) rejected a complaint with the firm that voia take take over a contract to out the technical project for work work to be executed.
the initial project was drafted by impex romcatel.
after the builder's insolvency and the interrupof the work, negotiation procedures were launched without the publication of an announcement with impex romcatel, with the company update the technical project and a new tender for works to be held.
" but the negotiations did not finalised by a contract, with the cj praising the proposed form would have put the institution at a disadvantage " said razvan timofciuc, which represented public relations within the cj.
the cj decision to break off direct negotiations was attacked in court by impex romcatel.
the emerging tribunal sent its complaint to the cnsc, which rejected it, as a tarar.
however, this does not mean that the cj can start searching seeking another design.
impex romcatel has the opportunity to attack the cnsc decision at the appeals court, only after its final ruling could be considered consider finding another design.
thus, work to strengthen the building could resume at early next year.
our intention is to restart work as soon as possible.
in principle, restoring the technical project should not take a long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
" we are waiting to see whether or not the cnsc decision will be attacked, " timofciuc said.
work to strengthen the former headquarters of the police questestia began in 2011.
a first works contract was terminated in april 2012 after works of 4.5 million lions had carried conducted.
the tender resumed, with the contract went to moldovans.
the firm entered insolvency, however,, and the contract terminated after paying payments of 1.5 million lpayments.
work has been done so far by about 50%.
initially, consolidation work, re-alisation and mansardare of the building had been evaluated at 7.7m lei.

ghinion for vaspe rapists.
they had accident and remained under preventive arrest
the trial of seven rapists from vassa moved since yesterday to the iasi appeals court.
emerging magistrates tried the first term of trial at an unpublic meeting in which the seven young accused of beating fighting an 18-year-old called to be freely freely.
before the actual start of the trial sitting, one of the extraordinary judges to whom the file, viorel munteanu distributed, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues from court.
the magiate activated by this summer of this year at the vas's tribunal, where he as president of the nale station, who was who, on 9 9th, admitted a challenge made by four of the indictees, placing placing placing under house arrest.
currently, the dossier is being tried by a complete of includes magistrates mymyththu and getuting.
earlier, in the file formulated a abstention and judge dan an ton, on the grounds that his daughter was in a relationship with competition with one of the violists' lawyers.
the two judges decided that rapists at the ship would still remain under preventive arrest.
ti nies will remain imprisoned for at least 30 days, when juby authors discuss the possibility of putting them at freedom.
the trial-term witness will take place at the iasi appeals court on 6 october.
before reaching the iasi appeals court, the duba with which rapists from vasship were transported was involved in an accident in the neighbourhood of pacwishes, a car entering iasi on the belt.
autoutilitara iveco with which the seven rapists were transported hit a volks wagen car exiting from stradela sing and the driver tried to drive on the left.
the duba moves from from an end of desiwishes.
the car entered iasi here because prison administration employees preferred preferred route from vassa to iasi iasi to jables, then on the bypass road.
they have thus shortened the road a few kilometres.
immediately after the impact, the arrest escort called called for another transport to take over detainees.
shortly, a car was sent at the site of the accident from iasi iasi safety safety ary, which took over the seven detainees and transported them to the appeals court.
following accident accident none none of arrested were injured.
to transfer them to the other duba, the guards surrounded the back part of the mans, and arrests took to speed, two two each.
" the incident was not reported to the police, because the do ua car drivers understood amicably as regards the damage to be paid paid, " chief commissioner madalin taranu of of ipj.
large migration migration
romania is neither nor will it be ready for what will follow.
but europe?
i say it from the outset, clearly and clear: the 7000 refugees they should and must naturalise to romania are, in itself, an insignificant but huge number compared to the ability of the romanian state to manage such a project.
for romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by bucharest, amounting to around 1500 soul, far far beyond our good intentions of solidarity with the european union expressed in recent months.
certainly, if those migrants really accept establishing in our locations, the chances of integrating them quickly into romanian society are extraordinarily small.
i am convinced that they will be the first to lose patience.
parazsed by underpers and paralysed by an venal political class, the romanian state is proving mimired in all areas.
the powerlessness to integrate gypsies is just a trivial example.
in addition, governments of any colour have not been able to absorb european funds, make roads, kindergargartens or modern schools, to ensure decent healthcare, raise the stakes on the street, create honourable paid or retain their own young generation at home.
why would refugees be established in another country from which they are running run?
but what causes a lot of wonder is particularly the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
we first locommitted of the rebelco@-@ lion faclion of the strong states of the eu, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing troubles with smaller countries.
then it comes the friricold hypocrisy of romanians who, although they have millions of cattered everywhere around the world, do not yet accept the other - by language, other religion, another blood.
perhaps of fear not steal them breaks his national away.
finally, there is also hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for departure, does not accept another destination for exodus than germany germany or northern countries.
however, not all refugees are syrian, and there is not no war in pakistan.
also, the simplistic way in the crisis crisis being analysed can only be taken cailed.
the causes must be eliminated, some support and, strictly misbling on the book of political correctness, i call for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
but in romania it is peace and even enters, from time to time, something foreign capital into the national economy -- but this does not prevent tens of thousands of romanians from leaving their country every year.
why are they leaving?
in this crisis, the european union has been revealed to us that chil,, torn apart and outdated construction of the situation.
we deplore the fact that romania is unable to invent a country project, but here here the eu does have any plan for the future either.
and improvisation and threats do not help anything.
what, then, the eu still using, if the only advantage romanians have enjoyed - the right to free movement - be called into question due to waves of refugees crossing cross borders as cheese?
at some point, the war in syria will end.
not the crisis of migrants, however.
in the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc etc., will push millions of desperate migrants, from asia and, particularly from africa, towards a better life.
with such politicians, romania is nor will it ever be ready for what will follow.

two brothers from tomesti have swallowed somminds.
they taken to hospital
two 9-year-old children, or 11 from tomesti, brothers, have swallowed several diazepam pills.
they found gratileries at home and took them of curiosity.
their mother was following treatment and medicines were not hidden.
children were urgently taken to the " holy maria " hospital in iasi.
they are in stable condition, as doctors say.
exclusively: a meeting that ruats your heart.
20 years received a courageous gift: biological parents
lost in hospital under unclear conditions, in the denial of the 1990s, when he had only two months of life, narromarried, sailing and helpless ess, and then adopted by a starwealthy family in italy, in the same years in which adoption was vaguely, a young woman was now now a bland beautiful girl, met the day before before biological parents.
the crina will fulfill these days 20 days, and her adoptive parents in palermo thought to give their daughter loloved a stunning and courageous gift: a visit to romania, to iasi, to know their unclear past.
" the iasi newspaper, " which witnessed efforts to search the home family after several extremely vague cluindices, witnessed meetings that that practically break your heart.
reports to reporters, emotions at moment, statements by those involved, their reactions are truly moving and overwhelming.
the drc's story begins 20 years ago in the rugsty town, when it had only two months.
then, due to a health problem, girl had to be admitted to hospital in the city.
at home, there began misdisagreements between parents, and the mother had to go on their home.
he decided to keep up and me to send me from home.
he stopped the girl, and since then i have known nothing more.
" when i learned that he was in hospital, it was too late, " recalls indurerata alina, the biological mother of the girl.
crina was internadmitted with her grandmother at pascani city hospital hospital, and also then the father's father, costica balcan, for work in the town of alexandria, teleorman county.
their lives were to break permanently.
no longer find crina at hospital
after internship, the ina's father left for work in another village, and returned six months later.
meanwhile, meanwhile girl was transferred to the iasi hospital iasi and the father, when he returned, no longer found her.
i think he had had almost nine months since he girl been in hospital.
" he thought it thought he was abandoned, " tells an granddaughter of the family.
due to financial problems, bunmother was unable to come up with crina to iasi, and the girl remained in doctors' care.
because no one was more interested in the fate of the child throughout the time, she was taken over by the directorate-general for social assistance and protection of the iasi child, who then gave it care care the placement centre in bucium.
there were years when abandonment and adoption were more ily regulated to today in romania.
at the bucium centre was found by italy italy's salvadore and his wife, a couple in palermo wishing to have their child but did not succeed.
they fell in love with the blonduta crina ina and some time she had to move definitively with them to italy.
the had had already done nearly two years as adoption formalities have taken.
when we saw the drc, i felt it was before us.
" as if my wife gave him his life, " he us smiling salvadore, the adoptive father, while catching in the palace of his warm hand of the girl.
in the country, crina's parents, alina and costica continued the searches separately, each where he could.
the father asked rugtisty authorities, but but received no answer where his child could be.
police then told them that they may dead, but in iasi parents parents learned what really happened to them.
when i sought her here, they told me to the court that he was left to italy in palermo.
and conditions conditions look for it did not had before.
asked us to god to be good.
i thought about it in all the years to passed, but there were not possibilities to humy, to find it.
" it is hard, " he tears tells us in the eye the the drc's biological mother.
but, even though the years passed passed, rugsty parents have not been forgotten.
in italy, salvadore and wife explained to the girl where he comes from and her past connects it with romania.
i was small when i learned.
i think we had five or six years old.
i reacted as a copy, i was curious.
" i wanted to know my parents in romania, " i confess crina delighted.
and her dream was to become a reality.
in march of this year, chief commissioner romica ichim, director of regional regional for prevention, evaluation and anti-drug and counselling, was contacted by an knowledge from italy, which explained salvadore's desire to find the drc's biological family.
and the searches started only from a name.
after the request we had from our partners in italy, we began the first steps.
we received only one name, balcan costica, then local, rugsty.
shortly, i had a job with city hall there, and i was able to ask whether there by quality the name received.
then they gave me some indications, only that the person found was not the one wanted.
" it took only a month month to ago to find the biological father of the girl, " chief commissioner romica ichim explains to us.
in all, more than three months have taken the authorities to find costica and alina, especially as everyone was living in another village.
we began steps somewhere in march, and in june-july we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
" then we established that a first meeting would take place in september, " romica ichim added.
at the weekend, alina and costica first saw their lost at the iasi hospital stations 20 years ago.
the father, emotional, could barely be able to master his ears ears and his hands had awawrellessly.
it is barely changing a few words with those around.
a week before the meeting, he can hardly even sleep.
it was also emotional, wake passing.
" to see your child after so many years, it is something, " tells us an granddaughter, coming with rugsty sty coastal coast.
cr's meeting with mother, biological brother
in his discussions before him, which is expected to study at a well-ranked university in italy, costica balcan told him, among other things, that if he once wants to return to him, to the village, to come quiet peacefully: it can give him some, capats, to find a boy in the village and spare a household.
my mother is also emotional, complains, and she hardly believes that this can happen to them.
i am very emotional.
i did not believe that this could happen.
i have seen such cases on television, i thought thought thought these years, i had hoped, but i did not think i could also be the case.
they are very great emotions.
if it could forforgive me.
i hope that we visit in the future.
" i hope we can able a a link, " tells us great tears at obraji alina, crina's mother, while keeping in the hands of a servetel.
in he is conceals his tears, fortunately, because he will shortly be seen with them after so bitter of time.
on the other side, the crina, which will be just a few days' time, this month, 20 years, is trying to reassure himself as an emotional child.
he does not know what to expect, but he sketup a vague idea of her biological parents.
he think they are young, but now before the meeting they are trying to give their thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
my parents are two mothers and two fathers.
but it is ultimately my parents who have grown up me.
it will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
" i hope i have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so much things to say, " i confess us.
first first family meeting in iasi
in the unification market, under the sky beginning of the autumn, the rugsty family family again unites its destiny before them in palermo.
the crina has 20 years ago, finish high school, along the italian school model, but can begin a new chapter with alina and costica, her biological parents.
there no longer divide borders or countries, but only a barrier: that of language.
fish which, with the help of an translator, an italian local owner at the centre of the hell, easily passed.
those who managed to make this meeting possible say that this is the first event of this kind do, and that, in future, if the opportunity still arises, they will do so.
it is the first event of this kind organised by such an emotional cargo, and i am pleased to be a success.
we at the centre have various activities, and we are often associated as an institution dealing only with consumer people, people dependent on drugs.
but we are trying to restore society something good back.
" if i have still requested for such a food food, i will do it with great dear, " says zambind romica ichim, director of the regional centre for prevention, evaluation, evaluation and counselling.
behind him, the balcan family with crina in the middle, distance away by burdens.
i am understandable: they have much to tell each other.
a truce with leg weapons yesterday at the psd.
everyone shoots his soul
camps in the psd psd branch sealed a gunceasefire on their leg.
after successive rounds of talks, held to sunday, the first being being the most tense, psd leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
pressure by party executive executive, liviu dragnea, to present a united position, the emerging social democrats will send him a whole list of potential candidates to party positions.
far from over, the internal war in the party seems to have taken a break to allow combatants to drag their soul.
dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
it has launched a very simple and very current message at the current now: you are trying to find a solution not to jeopardise the party.
on 3 october, we have party elections.
all functions will be made available to those who will like them.
" until then, we remain in the existing structure, " acting mayor mihai chirica said.
the two days of weekend talks only led to the conclusion that nothing certainty has been established.
in the october elections, fierce competition is expected is expected to the psd's county branch.
on the short list of possible candidates for the main post in the party's extraordinary branch are state secretary maricel popa, senator florin constantinescu, senator sorin lazar lazar, county adviser vasile catea and acting county council council president victorel lupu.
in addition to them mayor mayor como schitu is also taking, mihai mihalache.
one option under consideration is also the candidacy by psd county advisers leader cristian stanciu should lupu no longer join the race, with party sources saying he is not interested in the post.
the only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of former leader of the branch, mayor gheorghe nichita.
the candidate list is open.
under status, including on election day candidates can be made, and it would not surprise anyone if it happened.
" important important is that we remain united, and we will remain after october 3rd, when we have a new executive office, a new permanent county office and all new leadership structures, " catsaid.
until the internal elections are held, the leadership of the psd county branch will be secured by victorel lupu, close close of nichita and stanciu.
lupu, however, are on leave until 29 september, with preparation for the elections practically to be secured by branch executive secretary, county adviser mihail popescu, in reci relations with the nichita camp.
contacted by telephone cristian stanciu praised the talks in recent days as leading to " a partial consensus. "
there is a broad willingness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
partial consensus consensus was reached to support a unitary team to deal with the county.
" but on the other hand, there are several variants regarding intentions regarding to candidacy for the iasi psd presidency, the list remaining open, " stanciu commented.
extraordinary judge refused vas's violists' file over competition
the seven young people in vaslui county convicted rape rape today reach the iasi appeals court.
vasluians sentenced to sentences between five years to eight months and eight years, and four months will today present their arguments on putting at large, after the court of substance, vas's judge, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence encing.
the file was registered at the appeals court late last week, with magiate dan anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
anton cited that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer bogdan luca, is his daughter's competition competition, lawyer dana anton.
luca defends silviu ovidiu burada, who who received the greatest punishment on this dossier.
as judges motivated the sentence
late last week, the magiate at vasvasjudge who sentenced the seven young people motivated the sentence.
in motivwhy the judge talks about the defiant reaction of defendants, but also of those who supported him, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
" the court notes that after judicial control was under a preventive extent, the restrictive measure of freedom but not deprivation of freedom, under the impact of the attitude of defendants, their families and supporters supporters of their inhabitants, was felt at local and national community level a strong feeling of indignation about the fact that people accused of serious facts are being tried under a less restrictive, " " said to motivship judgment.
magistrates also also dismantled the main defence of the seven indictees who during the trial cited the girl they raped would not be " " door of church. "
" the court plays that it is without irrelevant relevance the moral quality of the injured person, something which the defendants wanted to highlight through the appliances they formulated, as a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext, " the motivation also stated.
corbyn, brexit and future of europe
for economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed in recent decades can no longer continue the same in the coming years.
by saturday, perhaps little world knew in romania who jeremy corbyn was.
even today, after he became the new leader of the labour party, many question to what extent it can affect our election of politician politician who, after all, not in a decision-making position.
jeremy corbyn is the most radical clusy leader of labour-war labour.
marxist said, anti-monarchist (once once asked tony blair, then, then prime minister, to take the royal family out of buckingam palace)), an anti-american anti feroce and a sympathiser of vladimir putin (he has otherwise been invited to comment on political events by the television channel " russia today)) and terrorist movements hizbollah and hamas.
for corbyn, who considered at the time the murder of osama bin laden a real tragedy tragedy, is almost preferable to the united states.
on the model of all populist demagogues, corbyn has, of course, mirmiraculous anti-austerity solutions.
things of the kind he said and promised promised tsipras in greece until it gave chest with the real world and economic legality.
the economic programme of the new labour leader provides, among other things, massive renationrenationalisation and printing printing as a solution solution to financing development projects and cover very generous social benefits.
of course, some might ask why the solution to printing the money is not unanimously adopted around the globe, we would then have global overall prosperity! but who would prevent itself from such details.
of course, we can charge blood on bankers, you have become some of service enemies of the left, but as far as as has been seen so so times in the past past, not only in former communist states states or ecuador venezuela, but also in france, at the beginning of mitterand hollande mandates.
the additional sums are quickly swallowed by generous, uncover promises made by populist demagogues.
as margaret thatcher pointed well well attracted, " the problem of socialism is that the money' money is over at some point. "
few give jeremy corbyn a real chance to ever reach prime minister.
in the early 1980s, another radical left-wing leader, michael foot, was not as extremely persubelief anyway as the fresh fresh party leader, failed lamentably in the elections.
and then there is still a workers' class britain britain in the classic sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured structured.
and trade unions were sensitive more influential as now.
at the time of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant as a whole force, and extensive automations have made massive massive need of highly qualified workforce in industry, corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
but, even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
in his last financial times number believes the election of corbyn increases the chances of brexit, namely britain's exit from the eu.
the new labour leader was a consistent opponent of country's membership of the union.
in the eyes of brussels' radical left is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has imposed austerity against the poor.
when combining this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that is rocking the foundations foundations of the eu are reaching an explosive mix.
and not just for britain.
but if the british decide following the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the union union the loss of symbolic capital for the entire european project and the deep fals created within it by the euro crisis, and that is why of refugees, between north and south south between between east and west, leaves room for scenarios of the most worrying.
all the more so because for a whole series of member states, london was a counterstrition on the franco-german axis (in which berlin is increasingly becoming the dominant actor).
that is true, british business, city, are strong lawyers of the country's remains in the eu.
but today's europe is no longer that of the past.
there are many resentment ment which are growing in intensity in in early very these weeks.
the problem is that brussels, i recently had a sample in jean clude junker's speech, increasingly tends to take major decisions over the head of the vast majority of member member states consulting only a few european powers, mainly with germany.
and this is a time when electoral support support for the-system system, anti-immigration ations that are also also eurosceptic is growing dramatically throughout the continent.
in other words, the emotional negative-charged climate has reached quotas higher than ever in the past.
hence the conclusion that the financial times draws when assessing assessing the chances of gap.
the pro-eu option is based on a cold calculation that leaves from national interest.
if voters make the cerebral decision, then britain will remain in the eu.
but corbyn's victory reminds us the power of emotion in current politics.
however, eastern europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
especially if, as expected, we see see greater integration of the euro area, which will push most of the states in the region and the outperiphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in europe.
corbyn, tsipras and syriza in greece, podemos in spain, even bernie sanders in the united states are feeding their populist rhetoric from the frustration ations ated in osocidal societies.
for economic and demographic causes, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades, generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the coming years.
under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the euro area - immigration, both caused by hasty decisions that have only taken into account the integrationist political ambitions, not the capacity and availability of the the peoples and governments of europe to respond to such challenges, turbulence on the continent, internal tensions in the will increase in intensity and major affect romania's situation.
and it is hard difficult rule out something in terms of possible scenarios.
the question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
constantin brancusi, the goddess taran.
rockefeller: " how can i help you? "
brancusi: " takes and mature the workshop! "
the great sculptor had a great dream: let be someone, to reach the famous, hear about it around the world.
behind his reputation hiding, however, something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, retcipes for life success.
that something also has a name.
it call' truda'.
what write about constantin brancusi?
what remains to be said, in fact?
his figure appeared on banknotes.
and recently a known bank of romania has hired an actor to play it in a advertising cli.
cheese si produces and supplies money nearly 60 years it is no longer among us.
in romania, there are hundreds of streets and bullevards bearing his name.
in fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
and, when it emerges odrasla, it hear the following instructions:' go to the park, cheese cusi'.
the country is impered by its statues.
there are few romanian figures whose works will be known by so world, from children to the elderly.
brancusi's infiltration capacity a huge huge.
the communists also failed to extirate from romania's memory and culture.
his quotations today today e the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of like s and share.
and, then, what would what still be to say, to writing about this man?
viewed from a lot of books and articles trying to reconstitute its destiny, brancusi's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
you know, there are those people who tell you that, if you have not had the luck to give birth in any large and in a family as starwealthy, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
and perhaps it would be a key here.
perhaps the forthcoming text should be started from here.
with a sentence, however detestable they are.
look at the success stories create, which are delivered to you daily in the newspapers and television.
look carefully at the figure of this man.
do you want to know how he has succeeded in life, how, today, has he heard a whole world?
it is simple.
he has worked every life to be someone.
that is what he did.
constantin brancusi is born on february 19th 1876 in hobita, a small fish fish common village, gorj county, at carpathian poets.
it is the fifth child of maria and radu nicolae brancusi.
although he came from a wealthy tareasant family, cheese cusi takes a modest life, but one of which had to reap his benchmarks that will guide his late artistic vision.
recalling childhood and places where she grew, the artist had to confess at at a with tutea meeting in paris since 1933: " then life was beautiful and harmonious. "
by millennia, people were taken a patriarchal life, happy.
everything is all med down from one season to another.
and do you know why things have changed?
the civilisation of the great city arrived until us.
brancusi's childhood, however was far from a idilica one.
one of the moments in these receive years of life is highly revealing for the combination of purity and violence that characterised the future sculptor or the spent in their home village.
the moment is reproduced in the work " cheese; a biograography, " written by alexandru buican.
in 1879, constantin brancusi had 3 years.
in the autumn of that year, when it was " at overnight barracks, " watching those who disguaste the liquidid to see whether the process is going right properly, cheese and catches a moment of general unattention.
it fills its tyres of tutuica and drink king on shamoppressed.
it falls into almost instinstantaneu.
the first people see only a few minutes later.
the mother panic panic then then hysteria, believing the son died them.
late evening, when father radu returns from alive accompanied by grerels, he sees away away the desperate signs of those who wholeheartedly expect him at his mouth.
the party immediately turns into jale.
the father is already considering of burial.
however, someone finds that it good good call baba brandusa, dofails and servitor of cheese.
cheese checks the child's respirath, then puts him under the balega cal nas, gathered from preajma.
the child child hard.
the world applauds.
while the boy is left to sleep his be, of joy, spending with rels continues with even more force.
the second day, the father and son meet through livada.
radu brancusi puts constantin to assembsome some nos and bring them.
the father ashis child head heads down and, with the nods brought by the boy, beat him to remember him.
and, while feeling the uststty of the lows,, small cheese has the revelation that the world can also be seen from another perspective and that the things around can arise overpled.
especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he had to recognise in old age, if not the astrhimself participates in his unrest.
let it have been the sun as disturbing as his father of what happened happened him?
the city currently is not working.
an mp calls on politicians to remember those who voted them.
independent deputy viorel blajut called on the psd and the pnl to stop internal battles and reguide their agenda to the electorate.
what we now see on our political scene is a great disdivide and that.
we have seen nothing of the usl projects in 2012 that continue.
neither the highway nor the regional emergency hospital, see only how politicians dispute possible location according to real estate interests.
let us leave a little political aside, gather and speak.
currently, the city is not working.
" if you are busy with internal war, you have no time for those who elected you, " blajut said.
he assessed that the current political class disappointed emerging voters, with a result be a very low presence in the upcoming local elections, around the 30% figure, virtually representing parties parties staundel voters.
the deputy also believes voters will also move to traditional parties, expressing reservations for new political initiatives, such as the " for iasi " party that will be launched today.
local parties have a very small chance and will only break from electorate of the right, not that of the psd.
such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually right the right.
" it is shamking the right, which is not good anyone anyone nor for the psd, " blajut said.
he made it clear that he is not interested in candidacy for the upcoming local elections, denying rumours of his intention to enjoin the mayoral race.
